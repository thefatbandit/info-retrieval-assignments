<p class="p p1">Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Ross Seymore </strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Hey, good morning everybody. I'm Ross Seymore, the Semiconductor Analyst here at Deutsche Bank and we're ready to get started with the next presentation of the 2020 Deutsche Bank Technology Conference. </p>
<p class="p p1">We're very pleased to have Forrest Norrod, the SVP and GM of the Datacenter and Embedded Business Solutions Group at Advanced Micro Devices. </p>
<p class="p p1">So, good morning Forrest and thanks for joining us. </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Forrest Norrod </strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning. Happy to be here.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Ross Seymore </strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Sorry. </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Forrest Norrod </strong></p>
<p class="p p1">I said, good morning. Pleasure to be with you all. </p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Ross Seymore </strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great! Great to see you back in the office as well. </p>
<p class="p p1">So, before we get into your specific portion of the business in the Datacenter side, I wanted to ask you one other question. Overnight, there were some press reports and speculation that about your semi-custom business and while I realize that's not exactly the topic of the day that we're going to be addressing here, I wondered if you could comment a little bit about those reports? </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Forrest Norrod</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Well look, you know as we've commented before, we have a very large ramp coming into the second half of the year, across multiple product lines, really across every business. And you know I can't really comment on any specific product or any specific customer, but demand continues to be extremely strong and the ramp is going about as we expected. </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great! Thanks for addressing that in general. So why don’t we dive a little bit deeper into your business. So the Datacenter market and the Server CPU market specifically, those have been great growth drivers for AMD over the last couple years, mainly driven by the EPYC traction, so I want to dive into that a little bit deeper. But before we do that, I've been asking all the companies a few macro related questions given the interesting year 2020 has turned out to be. </p>
<p class="p p1">So the first topic and we were talking a little bit before the cameras turned on here about COVID and being back in the office, etc. So how has the COVID pandemic, as tragic as it’s been, impacted your business? Has there been pull-ins from the work-from-home and the cloud side of things or pushed out demand, because new workloads are having a difficult time launching at a time when everybody's just trying to remove uncertainty. What have been the puts and takes in your business during these uncertain times?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Forrest Norrod</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yeah, I think generally we see COVID as a forcing function that’s accelerating IT transformation, to be candid. You know the necessity to have everybody, you know be able to work productively from home is I think you know driving an increase in needs for infrastructure. </p>
<p class="p p1">You know everything from the PC sitting in front of the user at home, to the backend infrastructure via the on-premise infrastructure or the cloud infrastructure that's obviously connecting all of that and enabling all of that work. So we see that as probably, you know as net positive that I think we've said before. </p>
<p class="p p1">I think from our experience, you know I think, personally I walked into March 15, 2020 expecting that it would really be a challenge. That we would see a hit to productivity, that we would see you know really a slowdown in our ability to get things done. I've been very pleased by seeing quite the contrary. </p>
<p class="p p1">I mean I think if anything, productivity maybe slightly up. You know people are traveling less, people are more available and we've had even for development of new products, we've had you know the engineers and the whole team really rise to the occasion, embrace these new tools, embrace the new normal and I think we've been able to maintain a high degree of productivity and keep the products on track. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">You and I were talking a little bit before again the cameras turned on, that's the quantifiable side of things. It seems like the productivity is great and then no product launches have been delayed on your side or anything like that. How do you think about the more qualitative side of things? The kind of the moments of inspiration, serendipity, those sorts of things? </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Forrest Norrod</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yeah, no I think that is again – personally that's more of a concern, that's my new concern I guess, is you know how do we replace the serendipitous moments that occur when you bump into somebody you know at work or an engineer leans over the cubicle wall. </p>
<p class="p p2">I don't know that we've got a perfect answer to that. I mean I think there’s a lot of experimentation going on with you know Teams meetings or Zoom meetings across teams, even in an informal setting. Not necessarily, you know a scheduled meeting for a particular work topic, but just teams getting together on a regular basis. </p>
<p class="p p2">We see some experimentation there, and we’ve also increased the round tables, and increased the birds-of-a-feather meetings to try to get some of that serendipity to happen. I think that's something that's going to continue to evolve though. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">So, the other dynamic that's made this year interesting is the U.S. China trade tensions. How has that impacted your business if at all, year-to-date? </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Forrest Norrod</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yeah, so look, we’re 100% committed to complying with the U.S. Regulations and we've taken what we feel are the appropriate steps to ensure that we're managing the entity list and our interactions with customers or potential customers that might be on the entity list appropriately. But based on the licenses that we've been able to secure, we don't expect to see a significant impact on our business at this time from any of those actions.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">The license application process and being granted license, is that changing with the most recent regulations? I think they went into effect this week, yesterday or today, or when you talk about the licenses that you've been already granted, is that inclusive of the most recent restrictions?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Forrest Norrod</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yeah, I think – look, I think it is a continuously evolving situation, and again we're going to stay in compliance above and beyond anything else. We are going to stay in compliance with the regulations. </p>
<p class="p p2">You know I think there is a little bit of uncertainty around exactly what these new restrictions translate into from a regulatory detail, regulatory perspective, but I want anticipate that you know we’ll continue to be able to have access within the restrictions that we need to service our customers. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">That's great to hear. So the last macro topic I wanted to bring up before we dive more specifically into the AMD side of the equation is kind of the health of the cloud computing market in general. There's big picture, debates about has the work-from-home really just accelerated the digitization of the economy like you mentioned. That seems like it's definitely occurred, but there’s fears that some of that could also be described as a pull-in of demand and we could be on the cusp of a little bit more of a digestion period like we saw in late 2018 and 2019. </p>
<p class="p p2">So talk a little bit about what's your view on cloud demand in aggregate and is AMD of the size and with the products that you're launching, somewhat immune from that dynamic regardless of whether you think a digestion period is necessary or not? </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Forrest Norrod</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, you know we're certainly. We certainly saw first off back in Q2, we’ve already said we saw a strong cloud demand in Q2. I think that again, the tailwinds provided by the need to lay on additional infrastructure for collaboration and work-from-home, you know clearly provided some tailwind there. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">But again, most of these, most of the cloud projects are long term projects that you know you work with to qualify your product that the cloud customer over an extended period of time and then it rolls out accordingly. You know you may see some acceleration or some additional impetus by things like COVID, but you know I think it's from our point of view more in a shared growth perspective. </p>
<p class="p p3">We are – you know we've got a strong set of products, we are in a strong shared growth mode here, particularly with the -- well not particularly, both on the client side, as well as on the enterprise side, and so I think from our point of view we’re little less affected by the macro market factors and we are more focused on how do we continue to execute the projects that we've already won and make sure that those deployments go seamlessly. And then secondly, regardless of what happens in the market, we got to gain share, and I think we've got the product and the roadmap to do it. </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So when you talk about that share gain dynamics, I want to dive into some of the technology side of that equation and what's driven that? Obviously there's a huge attribution given to the manufacturing node, not only your success in ramping that, but also what your primary competitors hiccups on that front. </p>
<p class="p p3">But before diving into that, I think the architectural decisions, the design decisions you've made don't get enough attention and potentially not even enough credit. So talk a little bit about the architectural decisions you've made, you know multi core processors, there’s a whole bunch of different things you could use. But talk about those decisions and how the architecture is driving those share gains as much as the node. </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Forrest Norrod</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yeah. No, I think that's critical and by the way they inter relate. They inter related in a major way and I’ll talk about that in just a second. You know I think that going back you have to look at the resurgence of AMD as the fruits, you know from the seeds that were planted back in really quite frankly 2012, when Mark Papermaster and Lisa Su came in, one of the first things they did in 2012 before Lisa was even CEO, was kick off the generation of the new high performance CPU core engines. </p>
<p class="p p3">So the Zen CPU Core Roadmap is absolutely critical and that when we introduced it in 2017, you know it was over a 50% improvement and instructions per clock cycle from our, the predecessor product. And so that has nothing to do with the process. That's entirely the architecture and the implementation of the design, independent of clock speed and independent of process. </p>
<p class="p p3">And so I think you know we also meet the commitment at that time that we were going to maintain a regular cadence of new CPU cores, you know building a high performance road map and maintaining a very competitive road map for the long haul. </p>
<p class="p p3">We couldn't do it all. We knew in terms of one generation. So you know that first Zen 1 Core was great and hugely cored, but Zen2 was as well. And Zen 3, that's at the heart of our next generation products is also a tremendously powerful architecture and you know right on the trajectory that we needed to be on. </p>
<p class="p p3">But then the question came, okay so we've got a great engine, how do we put it together? How do we make, you know both compelling client chips as well as data center chips, and that’s where I think we made quite frankly a brilliant decision. We created this – and again, this creates means, so I’ll give all the credit for the core architecture to Mark and team. </p>
<p class="p p3">Well, we created this scalable, infinity fabric that allowed us to interconnect CPUs and interconnect the rest of the parts of the design very quickly, very efficiently, very high performance and completely unlocked the topology of the park. So we no longer had to keep CPU and all the high performance components confined to one piece of silicon, monolithic use of silicon, and that’s hugely important, because as you want to add more cores, as we want to add more performance, if you just keep growing a piece of silicon, you know there's a non-linear impact on yield, there's a nonlinear impact our costs, and we couldn't – we thought going forward your customers are going to need so much performance, we need so many cores. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">We cannot do it with one monolithic piece of silicon. So we developed the chiplet technology, and we brought chiplets to both client enterprise and chiplets allow us to put a lot more silicon within one part than you could otherwise afford, and they also allow us to access advanced technology nodes faster. </p>
<p class="p p4">So if you take a look at the chiplets, the architecture of our existing products, we use 7 nanometer advanced technology for the CPU cores and for a desktop and server products, the CPU core chiplets are pretty small. They are about the same size as a cellphone chip, which is not a coincidence, because that sized chip is what's used to bring up and get into high volume production that new manufacturing node. </p>
<p class="p p4">And so by centering our design around that point, we can optimize yield, we can optimize performance and we can get into a market much faster. Get that, the advance manufacturing node out faster and put more of it in a socket that we could otherwise possibly do any other way. So I think that was hugely important and enabled by that infinity fabric, that infinity architecture that allowed us the freedom to you know put together our high performance engines in a variety of ways.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">That’s really helpful detail. I think people do underestimate the magic of the infinity fabric and everything else that that's unlocked. So, if we just get into the straight node, Moore's law node war discussion, how are you thinking about the advantage? Well if we back up a second, talk about the ramp you’ve had at 7 nanometer to-date, and does anything change given your primary competitors latest hiccup on their manufacturing side? Does that change anything strategically for AMD? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Forrest Norrod</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yeah, you know look I think we’re very focused on executing our strategy and running our play. And we always assume that our competitor is going to do extremely well, our competitors are going to do extremely well. So I never want to assume that they're going to run into a manufacturing issue or any other issue, and so we put our roadmaps together with the best technology that we can possibly get access to and the best architecture that our engineers could dream off. </p>
<p class="p p4">When – now because we did that, we could drive to 7 nanometer in a very fast way and again, accessing it to begin with relatively small chips, just using [inaudible] and that's driven our migration to 7 nanometer that at a very fast clip. I think it's the fastest ramp we’ve had on a new node and again, access is that advanced technology in a prudent way. </p>
<p class="p p4">You should expect that we are going to continue to take that sort of approach going forward, ensuring that we've got the architecture and the topology to get us access to the best possible node in any given point in time and so I think you will see us be very aggressive. </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So last question on the manufacturing side, given you guys raised guidance on your last call, which seems like a long time ago already back in July, that this year is turning out to be much better than feared, how's the supply situation? Do you have sufficient supply to do everything you want to do in the 7 nanometer side? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Forrest Norrod</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yeah look, I think you know supply is and I think we’ve commented, supply is sufficient, but – you know but it's tied, the places of premium on planning for ourselves as well as planning for our consumers, but we think we've got the supply chain, lined up from wafers to substrates and you know everything in between to hit our goods [ph]. </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So let's pivot over to the Server CPU market specifically and some of the market share side of things. I think AMD deserves a huge congratulations of hitting up to the 10% or double digit market share in the June quarter that you guys had promised. I know you're not going to give whatever the new market share target is. I think at the last event that I actually physically attended within the industry was your analyst meeting back in early March and no such number was given at that time. But I did want to just get your thoughts on the market share side of things. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">It took you about six quarters or a year and a half to go from the 5% to the 10% market share. How do you think the slope of that share gain curve looks going forward? Would you be able to double the share again in the same amount of time? Is it more a much fairer way to look at it that adding the incremental five points of share rather than thinking of it as a doubling what happened over that time? Would it happen faster or slower and why? </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Forrest Norrod</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, so you know I think I don’t want to get into the mode of you know setting new benchmarks along the way with fine granularity. I think I’ve always said about share looking forward is, you know we certainly aspire over time to exceed our historical high water park, which was you know the 26%, 27% unit share and certainly over time I think we've got the roadmap to do so. But we are not going to put – we are not going to put a slope on that line or put further intermediate milestones. </p>
<p class="p p5">What we are focused on though is taking the momentum that we built with the ecosystem and our partners and customers with the first generation of EPYC, Naples and now the second generation and continuing to build on that. </p>
<p class="p p5">So Naples for us you know was giving, quite frankly was giving the first 5%. It was getting to having people used to AMD back into the market, was having customers believe that we could deliver a high performance, a component, whether we were doing what we set, and to that end Rome was hugely important, the second generation EPYC processors that we introduced last August, it was hugely important. Not just because it's a great product and you know really the 64 cores offers literally double the performance of our principal competitors offerings at that point in time, so just about the same. </p>
<p class="p p5">Not only offering literally double the performance, the other critical part of Rome is it's exactly what we said we were going to do, and that predictability of execution gives customers confidence that they can invest in putting AMD into their infrastructure. They can invest in optimizing for AMD micro architecture and that we’re going to be around. </p>
<p class="p p5">And so Milan, along the same lines Milan is critically important, because it’s a further demonstration that you know the roadmap I stood on stage and you know in front of everybody and my brother’s uncle [ph] in 2017 that you know we're delivering three years or that we're delivering you know that like a metric, and that confidence that we can be trusted, that we will do what we say we're going to do and you can count on us, coupled with you know the high performance that we’re offering in Rome and we're going to build on in Milan, is I think you know driving you know rapid adoption for us across cloud and enterprise and you know we think we've got you know a clear path to continue growing this business aggressively. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Q - Ross Seymore</strong><br></p>
<p class="p p5">So yeah, I agree that trust is something that's key in delivering the roadmap with the products as promised on-time is something that all these customers need to see to be able to adopt the product and thankfully that's exactly what you're doing. You also mentioned about – I'll put it – I'll describe it a little differently than you would, an expansion of the type of customers that you're addressing. </p>
<p class="p p5">The initial around to 5% I think was largely cloud driven, less of the enterprise side of things. Talk about the broadening of the market that you're addressing. What's your customer profile look like in the first 5% share, what it looks like at 10% share and how you think it's going to look as you go beyond that level?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>A - Forrest Norrod</strong><br></p>
<p class="p p5">Yeah, I know look, you're absolutely right. When we put the roadmap together, you know you can't eat and know of it in one bite; you can’t re-enter a market like this you know all at once, and so what we tried to do was we took the characteristics of the Zen Core, the first Zen core that we have, which is a good core and it was also very efficient, served at lower power levels. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">So it couldn’t necessarily reach the same frequency as our competitors’ part in a power and constrained fashion, but it was more efficient than our competitors’ product in a power constrained environment, a high core kind of environment. That drove our strategy for that initial product to design something that was great at throughput. </p>
<p class="p p6">It's great at – in scenarios where you get 32 cores operating within a power constraint, you know 200, 225 watt envelope and was very efficient, very competitive there. Well, what workloads correspond to that? Cloud. You know cloud workloads, at scale workloads, certain HPC workloads and so that’s – that’s starting a virtualization, probably cloud workloads, that's where we saw traction in the first generation.</p>
<p class="p p6">There are also you know customers that quite frankly are more, you know very technically savvy and more tolerant perhaps with a little risk and so that's where we focused Naples and we said this at introduction and that's where we had the most success. </p>
<p class="p p6">With Rome, we opened up. Rome is a much higher performance part, both in terms of it doubles the number of cores; it uses a 7 nanometer process of course and it has the Zen 2 engine in it that opened up the aperture of the workloads we could compete in from say maybe 50% to 60% and with Naples those cloud workloads, those at scale workloads. With Rome, we designed it to have coverage of say about 80% of the workloads, including many in the enterprise side. </p>
<p class="p p6">Now, as it turns out, that design point was against where we thought our competitor was going to be and they weren't quite where we assumed they would be, and so I think the coverage on the Rome is even better than we thought. And so many more enterprise workloads are a great chip on Rome than we originally planned for, and so the expansion on Rome has been from you know going beyond cloud and certain memory focused HPC to really every HPC workload and almost every enterprise workload in addition to the Cloud. So we’re seeing a lot of traction there, and we’ve also put a lot more time into the ISV’s that are relevant to the enterprise side. </p>
<p class="p p6">The strategy with Milan was to get you know the Zen 3 Core and Milan out there to really have a 100% coverage; no excuses, no – you know no compromise really to have leadership performance in virtually every workload from enterprise to cloud, from you know new software defined telco and storage, you know down to IoT gateways and we think we were on track to achieve that and we think that's really going to drive the business going forward. So I think when we see Milan come out, we think we've got complete coverage in the market. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Q - Ross Seymore</strong><br></p>
<p class="p p6">So, I put that together and it seems like you've built the trust up doing what you said on time. You're expanding the customer base. Like you said, now Milan has no excuses, talks to – it can address all the markets, all the workloads, etc. So I'll give one more attempt to maybe put some words in your mouth, but would you be disappointed if the slope of the share gains was slower going forward? It seems like you have two big, positive big tailwinds that you didn't have when you were going from zero to 5% or from 5% to 10%. So with those tailwinds there, maybe just smile if you agree. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>A - Forrest Norrod</strong><br></p>
<p class="p p6">Well, look I want to drive this business as hard as we possibly can. We've got a great, great product roadmap to do it. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Q - Ross Seymore</strong><br></p>
<p class="p p6">Perfect! So let’s talk about the competition side of things. How does pricing enter this equation? Unfortunately I'm old enough to remember the last time when AMD did hit that kind of upper 20’s market share and the response at that point from your primary competitor was for a period of time to get very aggressive on the pricing side, and that kind of you know damaged the market temporarily for both, but really hurt AMD somewhat structurally. There's a thousand things that are different this time, but how do you think pricing enters this equation and are you seeing any change in the behavior on that front? </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong>A - Forrest Norrod</strong><br></p>
<p class="p p7">Look, you know I think we've always anticipated, you know there's a lot of scar tissue here at AMD, you know competing with Intel for many years and they’re a fantastic company, a great competitor. So you know we’ve always expected the environment to be extremely competitive and I would say that it's about what we expect. </p>
<p class="p p7">But the thing to keep in mind about the data center market is you know, and I’ve said this a number of times, it's all about performance. You know the one way to think about it is the CPU is about say 25% of the cost of the system, 20% to 25% of the cost of the system, but unlike its power you get a rap [ph] sheet, metal power supplies, motherboards, network adapters, memory and storage, etc. around it and so if you think about it from that point of view, a simple way, a simple way to think about it is if your performance, given that the cost of the component is 25% the cost of the system, if your performance is say 75% of the competitors, you could give your part away and it doesn't matter. You know you still can't win the total cost of ownership at the system level.</p>
<p class="p p7">So for us the principal focus is all about performance. How do we deliver compelling performance that translates into system level TCO you know for the end customer, because that's what the informed customers is going to do, is going to make their buying decision on the basis of that system level TCO, which is only very weakly correlated to the price of the CPU components. </p>
<p class="p p7">So you know that's our focus and I think we've architected – now I will say one other thing, that we’ve again architected the solution you know with the chiplet approach to be far more cost effective than perhaps following you know a monolithic roadmap with you know very large chips to reach the upper ends of the performance spectrum. </p>
<p class="p p7">And so I think we're seeing about what we expected. Our focus is on the system level TCO and I think we've got the performance to win those fights, and I think very thoughtfully architected our solution to be cost effective. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So the other competitive dynamic I wanted to hit on was more arm based CPUs in the server market. Its long been rumored as a viable threat against x86 in aggregate. You guys back in time even dabbled a little bit of some of the heterogeneity that arm might be able to bring to it. </p>
<p class="p p7">Recently some of the hyperscale cloud guys are doing some internal efforts on that front and then obviously as of yesterday or the day before you also have the turbo charging of the Server CPU on the arm side as part of Nvidia‘s logic in attempting to buy arm itself. So how do you view the competitive threats either internally or from merchant silicon providers from arm based CPUs in the server market? </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Forrest Norrod</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, look I think you know first off, I think we've always said that our focus is on the high performance CPUs and GPUs and offering a compelling competitor roadmap. And again, reference to my comment of a moment ago, I think that the performance is the critical thing. If you've got a high performance solution, you're going to win the TCO of battle at the system level. So maintaining that high performance roadmap is critically important. </p>
<p class="p p7">You know secondarily, there is the issue of course of migrating workloads from one Instruction Set Architecture to another. I would maintain that generally that hasn't happened. If you take a look at the history of the computing industry, it's very difficult to displace a computing architecture unless you have a new workload coming in. Because the thing that is theoretically the most fungible in the data center, the software is actually the thing that's most adamant. Its hardest to change, its slowest to change, and so for existing workloads it's a huge barrier to somebody migrating over to a new Instruction Set Architecture. </p>

<p class="p p8">You know that said, look I think there is and there has been for a decade interest in arm in the data center. I think that you know we see a lot of tire kicking, we’ve seen it for a decade and you know different companies make their own independent decisions. </p>
<p class="p p8">Our focus is make sure that we are always providing, you know extremely high performance and most competitive performance CPU cores and increasingly GPU and the combination together and I think that so long as we're doing that, we've got a great competitive environment ahead of us and we expect to see x86 is still the dominant Instruction Set Architecture in core. </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So we only have a couple of minutes left, so I want to hit on a topic you just mentioned, about the partnership between the CPU and the GPU. Obviously GPUs accelerators have been a huge market. Your biggest competitor on that side has grown that market from a couple of hundred million dollars to multiple billions of dollars per year in business. Talk about AMD's aspirations in that market and when do you think that can be a needle mover within your company as a whole? </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Forrest Norrod</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yeah, no I think we definitely see GPUs as a critical driver of growth in the datacenter, you know for us going forward and we’ve thought that way for a while. We’ve just tried to be very thoughtful about, we’re – you know any company has to make resource decisions and I’d much rather do a great job at a few things than a crappy job at one thing too many. But that said, I think we’ve been very thoughtful in preparing for GPUs being a bigger part of our data center portfolio for some time. </p>
<p class="p p8">When we think about GPUs in the datacenter, we really think about it in three different primary areas. One is essentially VDI or you know Remote Rendering; rendering in the datacenter, be it for cloud gaming or be it for a desktop, workstation, a replacement. </p>
<p class="p p8">We think that's an important growth area for us. We are pleased and proud to be part of several major cloud gaming initiatives. We are pleased and proud to be part of some great cloud VDI offerings as well on the productivity side, and given COVID, we expect to see quite a bit more of that or not just COVID, COVID and its after effective you know what effort people refer to as the next normal of increased work-from-home no matter what. We expect to see that VDI interest and market continue to grow. </p>
<p class="p p8">The second piece is really traditionally HPC, traditional High Performance Computing for scientific research, medical research, you know for product design and then lastly of course, and certainly far from last in terms of importance, you know machine intelligence, artificial intelligence, machine learning. We see all three of those as being critical growth drivers for us going forward. </p>
<p class="p p8">With all of them, the software is the key aspect and so we focus on a couple of things. First off, there is no point in trying to duplicate what my competitor has done. You know trying to run and catch up, running their exact same play is a fool’s error. And so what we’ve done is we’ve really worked to partner with others on development of an open source software framework for – or software frameworks for both machine intelligence and HPC and so we our rock [ph] have been stacked for example.You know radio and open compute is a critical part that allows our customers and us to innovate together and to drive some pretty compelling solutions. </p>
<p class="p p8">The second piece of this is, you know accelerator for HPC or machine intelligence was still hard to use. And so part of it is you know continued to work on frameworks, continuing to make it easier for developers to embrace this technology, but the other key part that we’ve talked about that's really led to our excess scale wins was adding coherency, so that the CPU and GPUs instead of being part connected by a thin IO link are connected via high performance coherent interconnect, where very importantly for the software developer, they no longer have to explicitly manage the pool of memory down on the accelerator via the GPU or anything else. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9">We think that's a huge disruption and unlocks a lot of additional accelerator capabilities. It makes it much easier to program and I think that was key to our excess scale wins. So putting those things together, you know we're very confident in growing that market quite a bit. </p>

<p class="p p9">Great! Well Forrest, time went really fast on us. Thank you very much for taking the time. It was great chatting with you on this. Congratulations about the great growth in your business and we look forward to monitoring it going forward, whatever the slope may be. </p>
<p class="p p9">So everybody, that will end this presentation. Thanks again Forrest.</p>
