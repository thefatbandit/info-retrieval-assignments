<p class="p p1"><strong>Lloyd Wamsley</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning and welcome to day two of the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference. My name is Lloyd Wamsley. I lead the Internet research efforts here at Deutsche Bank. We have another good day in store for us and I’m excited to kick things off with Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty the VP of Delivery at Uber. Pierre thanks for being here.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes, thank you. And thanks everyone for your time.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Lloyd Wamsley</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes, I’ve got some few questions with Pierre, but if anyone in the audience wants to ask a question, you can use the module below the webcast or feel free to send me an email at Bloomberg chat and I can integrate your questions into our conversation. So Pierre wanted to start off at a high level. You have now been in-charge of the delivery business for about six months. Can you talk about what it looked like when you came in and what some of the key changes have been in strategy and operations?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes of course. So I took over indeed the delivery business back in February it’s about six months ago. And it’s very clear that the business had been geared towards a growth at all costs, and frankly did a pretty good job at that considering that you know in a matter of four years or so we returned each Uber Eats into other not just for delivery platforms outside China. </p>
<p class="p p1">But as far as I'm concerned, a big chunk of my focus has been in moving this business towards more of a sustainable growth model. And so like the couple of things that can highlight in particular have kept me busy over the past few months. I'd say number one, and at a macro level, it's really been around and sort of focusing our efforts. As you know, we are to probably know we have shut down a number of countries in the in the early part of the year to try and make sure that we could invest and lean into places where we see the biggest opportunity for ourselves.</p>
<p class="p p1">So that's kind of been a macro focus point. Two, we have been leaning into the growth of opportunity that COVID has created for us. And hopefully some of the numbers that we've published for Q2 makes that clear. And this has really been about making sure that we could very quickly tweak our product and our service to really adapt to the new realities of COVID. And I'm sure we'll have a chance to chat more about that for the conversation today. And we have and I have tried to ready to go rate or create a strong sense of emergency around all of the competitive fights that we are having around the world. And I would say I'm pretty happy with some of the progress that we made in a number of important markets.</p>
<p class="p p1">For instance, most recently, Canada or Japan, but I'd say many more. And finally, it’s really been about improving our, our P&amp;L, improving the efficiency of how we do business. And you've seen already some strong improvements on our billing profile and our margins. And this is, frankly a path that we're all marching towards inside the delivery business unit, and that eventually will get us to a place to breakeven position.</p>
<p class="p p1">So on profitability, you know, it's a big focus among investors and inside the company. So before we get deep into the operational levers, are you done rationalizing which markets you're in on the delivery side, or is that still an on-going effort? Well, I'd say over I am pretty happy with the box for your that we are now left with one</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">So on profitability, it's a big focus among investors and inside the company. So before we get deep into the operational levers, are you done rationalizing which markets you're in on the delivery side, or is that still an on-going effort?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, I'd say, overall I’m pretty happy with the portfolio that we are now left with. We are a number one player in two third of the growth booking, international growth booking that we have right now. And we are actually strong number two in the majority of the remaining countries. So overall the portfolio feel stronger, which means I don't see a burning need to, to do more. Now, we're going to remain opportunistic as we've always been. And that means there could be deals on the margin or moves on the margin. But that's not a priority right now.</p>
<p class="p p2">Our strategy as a whole, maybe I should have started there continues to be that we want to be either in the leadership in the number one position, or in a strong number two position in the countries where we operate and that remains the case today.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Can you call out some of the key drivers to getting to profitability and maybe the trade-offs of pulling some of those levers touching on things like cost per delivery, optimization basket size. Where are you now? And how much room is left on some of these key levers?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes, of course. So the way I think about getting to profitability as a business, when it comes to the food delivery side of things is really about improving our uptake rates on net revenue margins, and I'll touch about that in a minute, and then optimizing everything that is below the take rate level.</p>
<p class="p p2">As far as take rate is concerned, some of the biggest movers are really the basket size, number one. Obviously COVID has been helping us to some degrees, but we've also done a lot on our hand -- we've done a lot on our side -- to increase basket size. I'm sure if you use the app, you're noticing that we are doing a much better job at suggesting bundles and things like that. And we've had pretty good results in Q2, I don't know that we have shared that before, but the basket size improved by about 17% in the U.S. and 11% globally on a year-over-year basis. That's for Q2. So this is basically a big, a big and substantial lever when it comes to improving the unit economics of the business and one that we expect to continue and pull from.</p>
<p class="p p2">The number two that I want to call out that it just plays into the take rate margins is the cost of deliveries. This is something that we're very much focused on to factor or a matter of like, what is the network density overall, both on the restaurant side and on the courier/demand side of things. How do you reduce idle time? How do you get to batch more and more orders together to try and really reduce that cost of delivery? We have seen also strong progress on that front. If you look at batching, for instance, we had in August about one and a half times more batch orders on the relative basis on a rate basis, than we did back in January. And that's really coming on the back of I thought the technology, but also the increase in scale that the business now have in most countries around the world and pretty much all countries around the world nowadays compared to earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="p p2">That's kind of the two big levers that play into the take rate. And then the additional levers I can touch on if you want. What's under the take rates are really things like what promotion, which tends to be a factor of -- that tends to correlate to the competitive intensity that we see in a given countries. And so I hopefully things continue to rationalize all the time. We think that this, the need for us to spend on promotions, will probably get down, so this is something that can prove to be an important lever as well.</p>
<p class="p p2">And finally, you have all of the operational cost lines, things like support costs, people cost payments, and so on that, we’re probably not for the each business big areas of focus upto a few months back and our areas and spending a lot of time on and where we've seen a pretty strong progress.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So asking in a slightly different way as well, how much of the improvement from today's you know, of roughly 12%, ANR take rates to the long term guidance to 15% will come from kind of a mix shift to smaller restaurants or higher fees to restaurants, higher fees to end users, versus just more efficiency on the delivery side.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, I don't want to be too prescriptive. But what I’d say here is at a macro level, I don't think that we need to charge higher fees from restaurants or higher fees from end users to be able to deliver on the take rate improvements that I've alluded to, and that 16% to that 15% aspirational guidance we've given -- we've given everyone. The key levers as I said earlier were really going to be about basket size improvements, delivery efficiency, restaurant mix shift. I have not touched a lot on that, actually in my previous answer, but if you look at the business you'll see a pretty large divergence between the sort of marketplace fee we have when we are dealing with, say a small mom and pops relative to what we have when we're talking about some of those very large and global enterprise spot-nails.</p>
<p class="p p3">And so, the way we influence shifts -- we influence mix it already has big implications on the take rate as well as the average MTF we get. And finally, some of the consumer incentives and other promotions that I touched on before, some of them being above and some of them being below the internet revenue to the net rate, the take net rates ANR, the adjusted net revenue margin.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So, so looking beyond in our take rates to the kind of 30% EBITDA profitability, where do you see the biggest levers on the cost side below that ANR line? You touched on it a little bit, but wanted to also dig into customer support. It seems like you've changed that to more of kind of an automated model. So wondering if that's having any impact on customer or restaurant turn?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, well, of course. So maybe starting with customer support, and then they can – grow, that probably will be my answer. But starting with customer support, you're exactly right, that this is definitely a big chunk of our cost structure. Basically, we are making and investing in a lot of automations that are helping us reduce the number of trips that need to have a human contact or human involved. Actually, our contact rates on a global basis have been down about 40% on a year-over-year basis. And that's really on the back of deflecting a number of those contacts to automations. But also frankly, reducing the overall defect rates or some of the contacts are just being killed in the first place by continuing to focus more and more on the customer experience, on the restaurant experience and making sure that we tackle each and every of those defects one after the other and find structural result for each of them.</p>
<p class="p p3">So this is -- this has been already something that's really moved in the right direction. But this is one that we will continue to invest into. I think there's a lot more we can do that, that's for customers who've got specific lease. Beyond that, or a bunch of things there's clearly some operating leverage on fixed costs. As you've seen, our top line has been growing substantially over the past few months. And we've done I think, a good job at being very disciplined with our fixed costs. And if anything, taking tough decision, hard decisions, like what we've done with headcount reduction, that have saved across the company entirely about $1 billion. And we'll stay focused on that fixed cost. That's kind of another, another set of things to you know where to expect some, some help or some tailwind from.</p>
<p class="p p3">And finally I alluded to that earlier, but it's very clear that marketing plays a big role as well in our P&amp;L, some of that is a function of competitive intensity, promotions, and so on. But some of that is also a function of how efficient we are at acquiring customers and engaging them over the long term. And on that front, I would say that I feel quite good about some of the levers we starting to deploy to create that engagement or to help with acquisition, be it a membership program that has now rolled out in a number of additional markets, most recently in Brazil, in Japan and Mexico, for instance. So this membership program is a good example of that. A lot of the things you can now see in app where we are trying to encourage a lot more cross promotion between our different business lines.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">If you look at for instance, our core Uber app, you will see now that you have the each used case that's being promoted, you have the grocery use case with corner shop that's been promoted. And those off-things that are actually helping a lot with customer acquisition cost and frankly, engagement as well. So this is also going to be a driver of improving marketing or marketing efficiencies effectively.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So you all have talked about batching and something that Postmates has done well. Can you talk about what they've really figured out, and where you guys in terms of maybe percent of deliveries that are batched? And where do you think that can get to?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So I'd say we were certainly very impressed overall with what Postmates have been doing on the batching front and more broadly on the cost of delivery front, it is very clear that this has been a top priority for them for quite some time. So we kind of looking forward to learning from that or, or to join forces on the line once the deal it gets approved. And the things when it comes to batching is there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
<p class="p p4">Well first, as usual, it's a factor of your densities, i.e. how often you have two orders that are going in the same place in the same direction at the same time. And so it's a factor of your density in a given series. It's also a factor of decisions and trade-offs you decide to make as a business. And if I think about groups, we have over indexed quite a lot on things like delivery times for instance, which means we might have been a bit less aggressive than all the players, when it comes to -- when it comes to batching. And it is a matter of the technology you have and how refined or sophisticated that technology is, and very clearly, to my earlier points, Postmates has done a lot there.</p>
<p class="p p4">And finally, there's an element of and that's kind of a sub bullet of the technology points, but being smart about what is it that you are actually transporting and starting to understand, what are the items that are going to be most easily batched? Is the food cold? Is the food hot? And as we expand towards non-perishable delivery use cases like Postmates [ph] starts today, that's also going to change the land of opportunities when it comes to batching. Those are a lot of the things that I'm certainly looking forward to engaging with Postmates on and that I think can drive some improvement on the Uber side.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So yes, personally, I noticed recently some increase in batching from Uber Eats. Is there, are there some things you guys have been ramping up? You know, even prior to Postmates on the batching side in the U.S?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Well, I'd say with me joining the, the Uber Eats business and taking on this role. And the focus on the shift that I described towards more of a sustainable growth model has gotten me to focus on a ton of things that maybe were not as big of a priority as I just said before. And I think the efficiency of the courier network is a very natural place to focus on just because it flows straight into a P&amp;L, which means any single sense you save is something that has a substantial impact on margins and P&amp;L. So I will definitely, tell you that I've put a lot more of an effort on that. And that's probably why you've seen us test a lot more things and drive our batch rates up to the point I was making earlier with batch rates being up one and a half X [ph] what they were in, in January. Yes, we've certainly been pushing a number of things. And we'll continue to do so and won't wait for Postmates to try and make that a big focus area for us.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So I have one, along this profitability question line from the audience. I'll go ahead and ask which is, do you all have in mind an optimal percentage penetration of the delivery versus marketplace orders, any order to meet your margin targets? Or in other words, how much do you need the marketplace business to grow to turn profitable versus kind of delivery business being profitable as a standalone?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, I can't really say it's a good, it's a really good question that I get asked a lot about. My conviction is pretty simple. If you take a step back and you look at the food delivery industry everywhere around the world, what you see is that the delivery categories is gaining share, versus the marketplace models or the aggregator models. And the reason is simple. It is gaining share, because that model allows you to tap into a broader set of restaurants, which is something basically consumers want and allows you to deliver much more or much shorter delivery times.</p>
<p class="p p5">Think about that, our delivery time for instance in France is 24 minutes on average, which I suspect is a lot smaller than any of the, the aggregator model of the marketplace model we’re able to achieve. So my first point is, you need a model, the delivery model is a model that is structurally gaining share. There isn't a single country around the world where Uber Eats hasn't been gaining share versus just you take away as an example over the past year, and my conviction is this is going to continue.</p>
<p class="p p5">And number two, I really don't think we need as a [Indiscernible]. I really don't think that we need an aggregator and marketplace model for us to be profitable. So a lot of what I've told you about a small chain towards profitability of things that have conviction we can do with the bowl as it is. Now of course, strategically it's in my interest to make sure that I can tap into that marketplace model. And with that in mind I'm actually quite pleased with some of the progress we're making. We have an offering which we call internally is BYOC, “Bring Your Own Courier”, which is effectively an offering targeted at merchants, at restaurants that already have their network of courier, their own network of couriers. And that offering is actually getting a lot of traction. We have in Europe for instance; I think more than 7% or 8% of the orders that are actually done with this BYOC model, which is not insignificant.</p>
<p class="p p5">And secondly, the thing that I find very interesting when I look at this model as far as Uber Eats is concerned is that we offer to restaurants what we call the fall back mechanism, which means that whenever their couriers, their own couriers are busy, instead of having a consumer wait and hang around and get a cold pizza, we are defaulting back this order or following this order back onto the Uber Eats network of couriers. And I was looking at the data recently around 30% three zero percent of the orders that we have with this BYOC service marketplace model are actually falling back onto our own network of couriers. And so that just speaks for the increased efficiency that there really is with the mall we have. And I'd say overall, the customer satisfaction, the restaurant satisfaction for all of the personnel that we have under this model is actually really, really high because of that fall back option.</p>
<p class="p p5">So that's kind of what makes me all the more excited about being a business that fundamentally relies on that delivery model. Why we will continue for sure to expand our offering into that marketplace sort of things. That's why I don't think this is something that is actually needed for us to be profitable because I have full conviction that this delivery model, this delivery model will be profitable.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Pierre wanted to talk about advertising. What have you all seen in the test of an ad product in Miami and when should we expect this to expand to more regions? And I guess, can you touch on whether this is contemplated in the 15% long term take rate guidance, or would a scaled advertising model be incremental?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So I'm very excited actually about that advertising opportunities. We have made quite some progress, that since I last spoke about that publicly, we have at this point rolled out our advertising products everywhere across the U.S. as well as in Vancouver and Toronto in Canada. It is not sold out to 100% of the restaurant. I think it's, I think we have about half of the restaurant that are eligible for this product just yet, as far as I remember. But we are quite happy. And the reason why we managed or decided to expand that is we were quite pleased with some of the early results.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">Of course, there's more work to do, you don't build an advertising business overnight. But over time, I think that will be a substantial source of profit that, we can reinvest into our growth, reinvest into, a bunch of things or frankly used as a way to get to this breakeven level and to improve on margins.</p>
<p class="p p6">On your question specifically as to how to think about that relative to this 15% take rate, whether that’s pretty incremental or not? I don't have a perfect answer, but I think my, my mind state at this point would be, it's going to be a bit of both i.e. some of it will be incremental. And some of it will not. The reason why I say that is, restaurants are going to be, prime set of users are going to be prime customers for this offering. And, it's not like restaurants P&amp;L, can ever extend sort of stake, which means it's a bit of a zero sum game dynamics. So why expect us to be able to, to charge for that product for sure and extract a margin. I can see how that might mean we have to get back on other parts of the model. However, the good news is that there are other lot of advertisers and specifically CPGs, for instance, that have clearly expressed their interest in spending onto this platform we had built, and those would be by nature very much incremental dollars flowing in. So I'd say on balance when you cannot net out those two effects and when you cannot think about the set of missions that you would be targeting advertisers that you'd be targeting for, for what we're building. I do think some of it will be incremental, and some of it probably not.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And it's interesting, you mentioned the CPG interest. What -- I think of the advertising model is similar to what we've seen in online travel, we're kind of a bit of a take rate, kind of commission override can impact sort order, is that the right way to think about it on a restaurant side?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">That is certainly on the restaurant side, the base case and this is what we have right now. So if you were to look at all our apps, in some of the places where we have an ad product, you will see that through the form of sponsored listings that are influencing the ranking that those restaurants have and then on the back end, we provide restaurants with a lot of tools that give them visibility as to the return they get on those investments as to how much they want to be it and so on. I'd say that's the baseline.</p>
<p class="p p6">Now, I think there's a lot more we can do, and we should do when it comes to advertising. And the example of CPG, we get asked a lot from whatever drink companies around, hey, I'd love to subsidize cans of soda to the consumers. And they are very interested into our platform, because our platform is a way for them to potentially access data or potentially subsidized at scale in an instantaneous manner, all of their products across an entire country, if not more. And so I know, for sure, because we've had interests already, and we've tried things at a small scale, that there'll be a number of CPG players interested in providing promotion effectively and subsidizing some of their products, most likely as part of your own basket.</p>
<p class="p p6">Then you could also imagine some sort of like be above model, where way broader set of advertisers could decide to spend -- but all of that is quite early days. So I don't want to paint things for what they are not right now. We're very focused on continuing to expand what we feel today as a net product. And over time beyond and flex those muscles in what I just touched on.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So on the last earnings call, you all highlighted a couple countries, France among them as kind of case studies for profitability. So what are some of the things that are working in France, perhaps across some of the KPIs we've talked about?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, first of all, I think I've said last time around that two out of five international countries were profitable. France is one of those five countries. The other of those five countries is Australia actually. And then we have a number of smaller markets and smaller countries that are profitable as well. And at the end of the day, I'm looking at France, but I could pick, frankly, any of those countries. There are few things that have been especially effective. It’s been about very relentless focus on execution and on operational excellence. To the point I made earlier, we're delivering an average in 24 minutes in France. And this is something that we know matters for consumer and that we know retains consumers that all the time. It's been about significant brand investments that we have made in France, in Australia and some of those markets that we see over time, all bearing fruits.</p>
<p class="p p7">You probably have seen some of the sponsorships in France in the field of soccer. As an example, I remember there was a lot of skepticism, so to speak, at the time when we signed some of those big things. But it has turned out to be a very worthwhile investment. So those are among those top factors. Now there's nothing structural about the country in itself that we cannot replicate elsewhere. It happens that in both markets we had a really strong rider base, and that has helped. But I can also think about places like Japan where we see remarkable traction despite having a rider base that is pretty small in the first place. So that's certainly been a tailwind, but it's not a condition -- prerequisite condition.</p>
<p class="p p7">So those are probably the main things. It's worth noting, in case some of you have not seen that, that there has been or have made some changes, leadership changes in the U.S. recently. And the person is now now in-charge of U.S. and Canada business is actually the person that took France to where it is now. And that most recently was leading our business across Europe, Middle East and Africa. So I'm pretty excited about some of the changes there and the move we're making.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I wanted to shift gears a little bit to talk about COVID and kind of what you guys have been seeing. When you look at the huge growth in delivery since the pandemic, to what extent is this driving new users to food deliver versus more intensity from existing users? And how do you see this playing out as things normalize?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So, there has been a few -- there have been a few factors playing in when it comes to COVID. Some that I think we'll keep for sure. And some that might reverse [ph] down the line. Basically, if you look at the past few months, you see that there has been a big increase in eater acquisition, first of all. Q2, for instance, new eaters went up over 50%. And so that's mean, a lot more people going into the category. And that I don't see any reason why we would not keep the benefit of those users. We see no difference in terms of how they engage with the apps relative to the people we had before. And so, I mostly treat that as an acceleration in a structural behavioral change that was already happening. So that's kind of acquisition of new consumers and those are here to stay in the same way as to ones we acquired pre-COVID.</p>
<p class="p p7">The same holds true with restaurants, by the way. We have seen a lot more restaurants joining the industry. So lot of the restaurants that were filing to close at times for Yale's [ph] have actually started to get into the category. And same stuff on the back of the feedback I'm getting and we getting from them and some of the data we see, we have no reason to believe that they will suddenly disappear from the category as the dining rooms start to reopen again. So that's for the acquisition side of things. Then we have seen an increase in engagement from the eaters, i.e. higher frequencies of usage. And on that, I do think it's reasonable to expect that some of it will normalize. This is currently not what we're seeing.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">So, right now we still see those elevated frequency numbers. But rationally you could imagine giving back some of that. We have seen basket sizes increase. And this has really been twofold. I think a bit of COVID impact with people maybe staying at home or ordering larger orders with families. But then it's also coincide-- it has also coincided with me starting back in February and making a big push back to the point around unit economics on basket size, given the importance that this has on the overall P&amp;L. And so you'll see in the app a lot of new things that we were not doing before that are helping increase the basket size. So those are kind of some of the some the big levers or the big observations as far as COVID impact is concerned. One thing I would say, if you take a step back and you look at the company picture, so mobility and delivery, it's been interesting to see some of the diversification impact or positive impact we've gotten out of having those two business lines.</p>
<p class="p p8">Our CFO disclosed last week that for instance, in France again, even with mobility being down 25% year-on-year, because we had bookings accelerating to 130% year-on-year for delivery in August. We were ending up with total GBs up over 40% year-on-year in August. That's a good example of how some of the two businesses are strengthening one another, or I should say rather upsetting somehow one another, counter-weighting one another. Right now, as we see some markets opening up, or as we see improvements on the delivery front, we're not seeing yet a negative impact or inflation of some of the things I touched on and specifically basket size and eater engagement, but it's something we're monitoring closely.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So another one relevant to this coming in from the audience, which is, have you seen any changes in consumer behavior in terms of using more then one food delivery app with COVID? Are users more loyal or still very price sensitive? Any changes you'd call out there?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">I'm not sure. So besides the point I made on basket size and eater engagement, I don't have anything in particular, as far as like, loyalty and stuff is concerned. The thing I would say is, maybe I should have mentioned that earlier. We have seen a huge increase and important increase in the success of our grocery and convenience offerings. Well, Cornershop, which is the company we bought in LATAM, has now a run rate. Well, I don't think we've communicated the run rate, but it's been doing quite well. And obviously has been seeing a tremendous growth on the back of COVID. And I'd say, besides just or beyond just Cornershop, our own grocery efforts, and I mean by that all of the stores and merchants that we have added into the core Uber Eater app, Carrefour in Europe and many around the world, those have also been performing extremely strongly, off a small base is performing extremely strongly and contributing to the overall growth. Those are some of the top trends we've seen. And as far as consumers are concerned, I don't think there's a ton I can share here on how that played with from a competitive standpoint.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay. So sticking on kind of this expansion beyond food delivery, as we look at the U.S. market for grocery delivery that would pit you up against some pretty well entrenched players and Instacart and Amazon and grocery margins obviously don't allow for large commissions from grocery store. So how does Uber carve into this market profitably? Are the basket sizes and user fees enough to make money here? Is the customer acquisition, the single point of customer acquisition across enough products, is that make it a more kind of profitable business for you all?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So, the first thing I'd say is, our entry into groceries is not unlike us starting Uber Eats back then, a few years back, and expanding from our rides and mobility business. There were a number of incumbents at the time with the food delivery space. And I think we proved that we were able to successfully leverage our brand, our technology stacks, our ops/marketplace DNA -- or logistics DNA, I should say, to successfully expanding the food delivery. And so, while fore sure, you're right to say that the industry in many countries around the world is already quite competitive. The grocery industry, I still think that we bring to the table some interesting assets that give us a real shot at becoming very significant in this category.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9">From a unit economic standpoint, a few things to call out. The first one is as a matter of P&amp;L at a macro level, what you tend to see with grocery is you get lower marketplace fees than you do with restaurants. But you do get much higher basket sizes. And so on balance that effect kind of counter or offsets one another, which means we do believe in the profitability prospects of this industry and what we can build ourselves. That's one point.</p>
<p class="p p9">Secondly, we see and we believe that, back to point about advertising, advertising can actually play a pretty important role in this grocery vertical. This is something we are already seeing and discussing with Cornershop, which has an advertising element in the app already. So that's another thing to keep in mind as far as the unit economics are concerns. And finally, because of having this large user base, engaged user base, we also think that we can have a key advantage when it comes to acquiring new customers and getting them to use our grocery we are growing for the first time. If you think about it, that user base has already been very, very helpful to us as we expand it to food delivery from mobility.</p>
<p class="p p9">I think it will be even more helpful when you think about moving from food delivery to grocery delivery, just because of how adjacent those two things are. Which means that whenever people open the Uber Eats app with the intent to order food, like having a grocery shop card that tells you now you can get your groceries, almost a natural extension that there will be even simpler and more logical than to tell someone while used to go from A to B with Uber, now all the foods are from Uber which already had been successful.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">You mentioned Cornershop and advertising. Are there any other things Cornershop has been able to do in Latin America? And for that matter of Postmates in the U.S. that give you kind of an idea of the applicability of that to your Uber Eats footprint?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">While the thing that I liked most about Cornershop is, frankly, the grocery DNA. They were born with a grocery model in mind, which means everything that's built is designed for grocery specifically. It's an extension of food delivery into groceries. And so they come with that DNA. That set of talents and capabilities, and unlike the capabilities you need are not necessarily identical to what you have on the food deliveries. And finally, if you look at the tech itself, they have build really good text when it comes to things like the merchant tools you need, or whatever the shoppers need when they are in store to actually buy the -- pick and pack the items. So I'd say, they come with a bunch of assets. And they have achieved a really strong market position in the grocery space across LATAM, which is as you know, a critical region for Uber and it's very important region.</p>
<p class="p p9">And so they come with that. And we have been quite excited about some of the progress we see on their front as far as the profitability is concerned. So I'd say, excited about the opportunity to grow, excited about how Cornershop can accelerate our own efforts, and quite happy with some of the progress we've made so far, especially things like Canada or the U.S., where we've kind of joined the launch with integrating them into our app already and so on.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Wanted to shift gears a little bit and talk about consolidation, competition. In the U.S. consolidation hasn't taken the foremost people really expected. How do you see kind of JET GRUB impacting the competitive environment in the U.S.? And does this change how you approach other markets?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Well, it's difficult for me to speculate, quite frankly, I think our key focus, my key focus is just operating and doing our best and improving the reliability of experience, improving and broadening the selection. So that's the key focus. Now, what I can say though is we are competing, to my earlier points, we've just Eats Takeaway in the number of markets, and again, because of their conviction that the delivery model is never going to work, they're probably never really wanted to get deep into that business, and to get deep into what it takes to win with that delivery business. And that in my mind explains why in every single country where we compete versus them, be it the U.S. and the UK, Canada, Belgium, Italy, like literally everywhere, we have seen a category -- pro-category position, grew our market share grew on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10">So, of course, I'll stay -- and I'm competitively paranoid, which means I'm always going to assume the worst and I watch things very closely. But there's no reason based on what I've seen historically, for me to be worried. I also think that with DoorDash going public, there's a potential a hope that we sought to see a bit more than normalization in some of the promo dynamics across the U.S. And I would say, we feel quite good with some of the progress we've made in Q2 in a number of cities that really matter across the country. And we're quite convinced that even in a number two position; we can build a really strong and profitable business out of the U.S. market, although my personal ambition is definitely not to stay in number two.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">So looking maybe outside the U.S., would you say that delivery competitive dynamics are broadly stable? How would you kind of characterize those if you had to make a generalization?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Well, what I would say is, first of all, as far as our own market position is concerned, I would say that in the majority of the markets and in particular the majority of the large scale market that we're competing too, I am happy with the trajectory, which means, I'm not happy everywhere we where we are. But I'm happy with the fact that every single month, I'm seeing things move in the right direction. We are already as I think we mentioned before, in a really strong position in places like Australia, like France, like now Canada, like now Japan, and in the places like the UK or like Spain, and so on that are not yet markets where we have a leading position. I'm seeing our market share category position move up on a pretty gradual basis, which makes me comfortable as to where that's headed so to speak. So that's kind of the situation as far as we're concerned.</p>
<p class="p p10">On the broader competitive dynamics, well, as you know, there has been a lot of consolidation in the industry over the past decade or two, which means that you have a handful, maybe three, four players that have that relevance at a global scale. And as far as players are concerned, to the point I made before, not every one of them has conviction or have capabilities to go deep into that delivery business. And again, I have full confidence that you look at this industry globally, five years from now 10 years from now, 15 years from now, delivery will be what it's really about and I suspect the marketplace, we always thought to become a smaller and smaller share of that whole pie.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Here I wanted to shift gears a little bit, talk about regulatory. Can you give us a sense of how early polling looks for Prop 22?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Well, I don't have any number. I'll say, differently. I don't think we're commenting on some of the recent polling specifically. Now, overall, what we said that I will definitely reiterate is, we're quite confident that voters will support Prop 22, which fundamentally upholds the desire of drivers to continue to work whenever they want. And if you live in California, you have seen us a star campaign already on Prop 22. And you'll see that increase even more as we approach the election day. The good news of what makes me especially optimistic about what will eventually happen is that 72% of the drivers that we have asked are telling us, they do not want to be employees. And so I do think at the end of the day that this is what a lot of people if not most people are looking at. And so I'm kind of optimistic about where that will be headed. Of course, if we were to fail with Prop 22, that means, we would have to see using independent contractors. And so we are exploring what alternative models could be in that context to make sure that we can continue and operate the business.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p11">Now, it's very clear and I'd say, maybe even more so on the mobility front, that those new models would have to involve higher price points and therefore making that more of a niche opportunity, preventing a number of drivers from accessing the sort of economic opportunity that we create today. So there's suddenly a lot of downside overall and including for society more broadly. And I'm, frankly optimistic that we'll get to the outcome we want on election day because most people understand actually the implications of loss in Prop 22.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Here, I wanted to sneak in one last question before we're out of time, which is you mentioned earlier, the expansion of some of the subscription products? Can you just talk about what kind of penetration rates you've seen? And what that does, perhaps to purchase frequency or basket size when you get people on a subscription?</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Of course, so I'd say first of all, the Eats Pass, which is the name we use for our delivery subscription has been available for a few months now in the U.S., and now in a few countries around the world. In the U.S. specifically, we're seeing double digit percentage of our delivery GBs coming from paid members, which we are happy with. Although, we think there's a lot more we can do in terms of increasing that penetration, which we -- the way we think about the future of our business. The reason why it's fundamentally and interesting lever and engagement level is that it achieved a few things. It increase as you can expect, the engagement that user have a number of orders that they make on a weekly monthly basis, it increases basket sizes as well, because what you typically have is your free delivery only kicks in after a certain threshold is met.</p>
<p class="p p11">So it helps the basket size. And then you obviously collect the subscription fee on top of eventually having the opportunity if you'd like to, to charge restaurants for being part of that membership offering. So for all those reasons, I'm actually very bullish about this being an important investment for us. And I have been very impressed also by some of the progress we've made outside the U.S., most recently in Japan, for instance, with this offering.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Lloyd Wamsley</span></strong></p>
