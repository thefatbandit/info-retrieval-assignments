<p class="p p1">Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Today is Tuesday, September 15, and welcome to the Butler National Corporation First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]</p>
<p class="p p1">Your call leaders for today's call are David Drewitz, Creative Options Communications; Clark Stewart, President and CEO; and Craig Stewart, President of Aerospace Group.</p>
<p class="p p1">I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Drewitz. Mr. Drewitz, you may begin.</p>

<p class="p p1">So with that statement completed, I am going to turn the call over to Mr. Clark Stewart. Mr. Stewart?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Clark Stewart</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you, David. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We’re pleased to have you join us for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, and we reported a loss of $15,000, which is amazing given the fact that the casino was closed down for some 65 days in March, April, and May. And so, part of that closedown was in May, and we still ended up only losing $15,000 overall.</p>
<p class="p p1">Our backlog is strong and around $20 million. We have adequate cash to operate. The casino business I guess has opened back up the last nine days of May and running 280 machines, and now we're up to 353. We're still experiencing some day -- evenings when we don't have enough machines, but eventually we will get that taken care of as we get past COVID.</p>
<p class="p p1">The loss this quarter to us is about $1.2 million from the casino, and the cash side of that is not that much, about $660,000. Patrons are returning. They're spending more money per visit. The older market segment is probably the last ones to return. In other words, I'm saying over 65 or 70, that is the fact but they are gradually coming back. We have actually beat some of the last year’s numbers during the last couple of months, and which we're really pleased with that which really says our market is back spending money and visiting the casino, so we're proud of that.</p>
<p class="p p1">Overall, I think we're sound, and we did get some PPP money. I'll let Tad talk about that a little later. We also had some at the Butler level, and we didn't think we'd get any casino money. So, the PPP money for Butler National Corporation, we turned back in. And just to – we have a couple million dollars as it shows in there from the PPP program for the casino.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">As I understand it, we have not reported any income or any benefit of that money other than we have the cash and we have the debt, and we still have the expense. So when it's forgiven, that's when it will be reported. As far as the casino goes, that's basically it.</p>
<p class="p p2">Craig, do you want to talk about aerospace?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Craig Stewart</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Sure. Aerospace was down a little bit revenue wise this last quarter from the previous year. The $8.9 million we did the previous year was a really strong quarter. We're seeing a little bit of shift in revenue from the Avionics business, and the aircraft modification business is picking up that slack for the most part. The backlog has shifted significantly towards the aircraft modification side.</p>
<p class="p p2">Our business at Avcon is extremely strong right now with a significant backlog. Avionics is still continuing to do well just not at the level it was a year ago. We expect some uptick here over the next few months in the Avionics business, but it's remaining solid, and yes I think we should continue to see good business from aviation side of things.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Clark Stewart</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Thank you, Craig. From the standpoint of accounting, Tad, do you want to talk about any more on the PPP, then I’ll just close.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Tad McMahon</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, just that, we received just over $2 million in the PPP loan that has been shown. It is shown in current debt, and we have filed for the forgiveness. We believe that we’ve spent the money in accordance with the guidelines. And so, now we'll wait until we hear anything on the forgiveness, which could be approximately five months. At that time, if we receive forgiveness, then that amount of that PPP loan would fall and show up into other income when we receive the forgiveness and it may be for a 100% or some percentage, we don't know at this time, what that will look like.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Clark Stewart</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Thank you, Tad.</p>
<p class="p p2">I would point out to you that the overall loss of the casino is approximately $5 million total for 65 days. So it is expensive to have nothing happening. As far as recognition of any of that like Tad says, we're not going to do that until later. As far as the buyout of the land and building, as you know, that's dependent upon the - I guess the actions of the COVID, I would say really the attitude of the people in the Midwest relative to COVID.</p>
<p class="p p2">Currently, we are underway moving forward, and I would tell you all that subject to what's really happening with the virus. But I think we are definitely moving, the bank is moving, and there is something happening now. When it's going to close, I don't know the answer to that.</p>
<p class="p p2">So with that, I think that we have a positive quarter even though we lost $15,000. Is there anything - any other comments, Chris, do you have anything?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Chris Reedy</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">David, I think we're ready for questions.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>David Drewitz</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">All right. Great. Let's open it up to questions.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p2"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sam Rebotsky at SER Asset Management. Your line is open.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Sam Rebotsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Clark and Craig, tell me as far as the Avionics, the sales were reduced. Number one, did we have the same number of employees, the cost of the production was basically the same with less revenue?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Chris Reedy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Do you want me to answer that?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Clark Stewart</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Basically from the avionics segment, some of that is a little bit of timing of when we ship things out in Arizona, but basically we have the same number of employees from an avionics standpoint as we had plus or minus one or two depending on where we are. It's a little bit cyclical.</p>
<p class="p p2">As a company, we've never been a company that is - things get dropped off temporarily. We don't [indiscernible] hurry to lay people off because it's hard to get the skilled labor back. So, we basically will hold on to the employees knowing that the business is a little bit cyclical, and then when it comes back up, we need those employees to be able to meet the demand that we're going to have in the near-term future.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Sam Rebotsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Thanks - so, yes, yes…</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Clark Stewart</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">I think the other thing that we don't do is percentage of completion in Tempe. And so, we get some bumps there because we have a large number of units, and then they are shipped and the revenue comes in or we may have a month or two where we are building up the supply for that order. You've got to realize these orders are million dollar type orders. So we may have to think about whether we do percentage of completion there.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Sam Rebotsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So some - yes, so do we defer - we don't defer expenses that we might have on the work that's not shipped.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Clark Stewart</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, go ahead and answer.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Chris Reedy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, I mean, the cost directly to that unit is in there, but these are pretty high spread margin units. So, the cost goes into inventory, work-in-process or finished goods inventory, or raw materials, but we don't recognize the revenue on the avionics is very high on <strong>- i</strong>t’s good, very good margins on some of the stuff, so that margins isn't recognized.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Tad McMahon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Now, the costs are deferred as the units are built, Sam, that has -- when we ship them, we recognize the revenue. So you're going to get the costs occurring in inventory, and it's sitting there on the books waiting to be matched to the revenue, and then the revenue comes in, in months. And so that's why the profit varies.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Sam Rebotsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And so the - yes, the backlog that we have, has that been increasing proportionately as we get to the end of the July period, or is there more work that we're bidding on or how is the backlog coming along and the work in avionics?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Craig Stewart</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">The avionics backlog is probably down from a little bit where it was a year ago. We've shipped a lot and haven't taken as many new orders there. We're hopeful that we'll get a couple of new orders here over the next couple of months that will push that backlog back up from an avionics standpoint. The modification segment backlog has been increasing over the last six to nine months pretty steadily and it is a good chunk of - it's probably almost 75% of the backlog for the company at this point.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Sam Rebotsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And this…</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Clark Stewart</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">One more piece to that. A lot of these customers for the modifications are coming from overseas, and the travel situation with the COVID is causing that schedule to be a little more than smooth. It's rough because they can't go to some countries, they can't stop for fuel, or they'll get quarantined for COVID and all kinds of stuff. So, we've been trying to work around that to get some of that to flow a little better. So, if you're coming 2,500, 3,000 miles to get to Newton, Kansas, you’ve got your work cut out for you, especially these special-mission type airplanes.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Sam Rebotsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. In the gaming area, is there any way that we could sort of work to take bets, et cetera, like some of the other, like Pen and very various other gaming companies. Does that fit into the Kansas model? Do we know - firstly, are we allowed to take bets? Number two, would we need somebody to do it for us or Or what's our thought about that?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Craig Stewart</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">We can take bets within the casino brick-and-mortar, if you will, and no sports betting, but I'm saying we can take bets. So, now, if you look at that relative to sports betting, we're not authorized that isn't the Kansas Lottery to settle the game yet. So that hadn't been defined. So, none of the casinos are doing sports betting or any kind of online betting at this point.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Sam Rebotsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Is there a plan to look to do that with -- even though with the gaming improving, but slowly that we’ve lost the 65 days? Is there any thought in Kansas to allow sports betting as this seems to be the travel problem would be another avenue of revenue and profitability?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Tad McMahon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">That's really not up to us. That's up to the Kansas Lottery and the Kansas Governor and the legislature in the State of Kansas. It was talked about last year. And it will, I'm sure, come up this session and we'll see what happens.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Sam Rebotsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay, okay.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Tad McMahon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">We don't really have much to do with that.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Sam Rebotsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. All right. Hopefully, this quarter will be more profitable and we'll have a rational, more people will - I guess as far as buying stock with the stock down at this level, has Butler been buying stock as they had needed stock earlier.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Tad McMahon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">We have been buying stock back, yes, as it is presented coming from the States and other things like that. Where they contact us, we have been doing that, and I believe those numbers are in there…</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Clark Stewart</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I think we purchased 212,000 shares this quarter. We only have this quarter since our open period is when we filed the K to the end of the quarter, which was about two weeks this quarter, we only had two weeks to purchase shares. Next quarter, we'll have about 45 days. Yes, we're in a period right now where we can buy shares again.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Sam Rebotsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">All right, that's good. That's good. All right, hopefully things improve and get to be greater profitability. Good luck, gentlemen.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Clark Stewart</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Thanks, Sam.</p>

<p class="p p4"><strong>Clark Stewart</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">No. Now, I want to thank everyone for taking their time this morning to listen to the Butler National story. We think it's a positive quarter.
