<p class="p p1">It is now my pleasure to pass the call to Keith Katkin, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Novus Therapeutics.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Keith Katkin</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. As we communicated back in June, Novus initiated the process of exploring a range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. Yesterday, we were very pleased to announce the conclusion of that process with the acquisition of Anelixis Therapeutics.</p>
<p class="p p1">We believe the acquisition of Anelixis represents the highest potential value creation opportunity for our shareholders and creates the most promising path for Novus's future. I would like to thank our board members, past and present, alongside our investors in their commitment and support in advancing at Novus' mission.</p>
<p class="p p1">It is now my sincere pleasure to introduce Dr. David-Alexandre Gros or DA, our newly appointed CEO and member of the Board of Directors of Novus Therapeutics. DA arise at Novus from Imbria Pharmaceuticals where he Co-Founded and where he served as CEO and Chairman of the Board.</p>
<p class="p p1">Prior to Imbria, he was President and COO of Neurocrine Biosciences; Chief Business and Principal Financial Officer of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals; and Chief Strategy Officer at Sanofi. Before Sanofi, he had leadership positions in healthcare investment banking at Centerview Partners and at Merrill Lynch and in healthcare consulting at McKinsey &amp; Company.</p>
<p class="p p1">He earned his MD from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and MBA from Harvard Business School, and a BA from Dartmouth College. I have known VA for over a decade and look forward to his taking this company forward in this next phase of its development.</p>
<p class="p p1">With that, I would now turn the call over to DA. DA?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Dr. David-Alexandre Gros</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thanks, Keith, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm excited and humbled by the opportunity to lead Novus, as we pursue a new direction, with a focus on patients for whom anti-CD40 ligand therapeutics may provide a potentially lifesaving treatment option.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">As Keith mentioned, our Board of Directors recently explored a range of strategic options to create and maximize value for Novus shareholders. It identified and sees the best possible opportunity in acquiring a privately held biotechnology company analysis therapeutics, which has developed AT-1501 a next generation anti-CD40 ligand antibody with broad therapeutic potential.</p>
<p class="p p2">We believe that AT-1501 has the potential to be the best molecule in this class. With AT-1501 as the cornerstone of our pipeline, we see ourselves poised to grow Novus around this target and develop therapies to help patients undergoing organ or cellular transplantation as well as those living with autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases, all of whom face limited treatment options.</p>
<p class="p p2">The Novus' Board of Directors believes that the acquisition of Anelixis represents the greatest value creation opportunity for Novus' stockholders as well as one that has the potential to bring great benefits to patients.</p>
<p class="p p2">The acquisition of Anelixis was structured as a stock for stock transactions whereby all of Anelixis outstanding equity interests were exchanged for a combination of shares of Novus common stock and shares of a newly created non-voting convertible preferred stock. These non-voting shares may become voting shares should they eventually be converted to common shares.</p>
<p class="p p2">With acquisition of Anelixis, Novus entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of Series A non-voting convertible preferred stock in a private placement to a group of accredited investors led by BVF Partners with participation from Cormorant Asset Management, Ecor1 Capital, Logos Capital, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Adage Capital Partners, Woodline Partners, Ridgeback Capital, Janus Henderson Investors, and Samsara BioCapital, as well as additional investors.</p>
<p class="p p2">The private placement is expected to result in gross proceeds to Novus of approximately $108 million before deducting placement agents and other offering expenses. The proceeds from these private placements will be used to advance Phase 2 clinical trials of AT-1501 in up to four indications, renal transplantation, islet cell transplantation, autoimmune nephritis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS.</p>
<p class="p p2">Our vision for Novus is clear, we will be focused, we will be agile, and we will be guided by the data and by the science. The biology around CD-40 and CD-40L is well validated, and we believe that CD-40L is not only the optimal target to drive therapeutic efficacy, but that we also have a potentially best-in-class antibody. We are excited that AT-1501 and to use interim readouts when possible to optimize its development and to update investors.</p>
<p class="p p2">On a personal note, I am grateful to be partnering with Steve Perrin, our new President and Chief Scientific Officer, to whom I will shortly pass the call. Steve invented AT-1501 and brings over 20 years of drug development experience to Novus, having most recently co-founded of Anelixis Therapeutics and served as its Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p class="p p2">Over the past decade, Steve has worked with the ALS, Therapy Development Institute or TDI, to build the world's largest ALS drug development program, bridging preclinical and clinical programs and Anelixis was originally spun out of TDI.</p>
<p class="p p2">Prior to TDI and Anelixis, Steve held R&amp;D positions at the Hoechst-Ariad Genomics Center, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, and Biogen Idec. He received a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Boston University Medical Center where he also started his career as Associate Professor for Medicine. He has a Bachelor of Science from Boston College.</p>
<p class="p p2">Steve.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Steve Perrin</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Thank you, DA. As DA mentioned, CD-40 and CD-40 ligand receptors have been an attractive target in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry for decades. The engagement of these receptors play a pivotal role in immune system activation, by mediating both antibody and severe immune responses through modulation of germinal cell function, T-cell responses, as well as polarization of pro-inflammatory T cells.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">The initiation of a robust immune response is mitigated by co-stimulatory signaling the CD-40 ligand binds co-stimulatory receptor such as CD-40 on antigen presenting cells as these antigen presenting cells are simultaneously presenting foreign peptides on their MHC receptors to the T-cell receptors on lymphocytes.</p>
<p class="p p3">The interaction of CD-40 ligand and CD-40 results in clonal expansion, antibody production, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that amplify an immune response, blocking the activation of the CD-40 ligand pathway [indiscernible] reached diseases progression and pathology in preclinical models of autoimmunity and prevents acute and long-term allograft transplant rejection in multiple species.</p>
<p class="p p3">Mechanistically, blocking this pathway results in impaired germinal cell center function, B-cell activation, and T-cell polarization to pro-inflammatory lymphocytes, but importantly, it does not cause systemic lymphopenia. The opportunity incitement to clinically regulate the activity of the CD-40, CD-40 ligand pathway is reflected in the multiple companies with Phase 2 programs targeting either the receptor or the ligand and a spectrum of autoimmune and transplant indications.</p>
<p class="p p3">For several of our programs, there are competitive clinical programs, but Novus is the only company exclusively focused on CD40 ligand biology. In addition, Novus is the only company focused on islet cell transplant for people with Type 1 diabetes and ALS. Our lead program AT-1501 is our first-in-class IgG1 anti-CD40 ligand antibody, blocking FC effector function. It has high affinity binding to CD40 ligand, has shown very good manufacturability and biological activity and has a half life of 18 to 26 days in humans.</p>
<p class="p p3">We are focusing our efforts on the development of an antagonistic antibody targeting the ligand rather than receptor since targeting the ligand has been shown to be more efficacious in preclinical models of autoimmunity and in the prevention of acute and long-term allograft transplant rejection.</p>
<p class="p p3">This preclinical efficacy maybe mediated by several factors including differences in the cellular distribution, photoreceptor versus the ligand, anti-CD40 ligand antibodies also inhibit both CD40 as well as CD11 co-stimulatory receptors on antigen presenting cells, thus inhibiting the pro-inflammatory polarization to CD4 positive and CD8 positive lymphocytes. Blocking the ligand also polarizes CD40 positive lymphocytes to FoxP3 positive Treg, which functionally secrete islet 10 and other cytokines creating a tolerogenic environment in the context of preventing allograft transplant rejection in autoimmunity.</p>
<p class="p p3">To date, we have completed a single ascending dose Phase 1 study of AT-1501 in healthy volunteers and people with ALS. In this study, AT-1501 showed a good safety profile with low ADA responses that were not dose related. We observed linear dose proportionality across the dose ranges and half life of up to 26-days. This data suggests the potential for extending dosing intervals and for the development of more convenient administration methods such as subcutaneous formulations.</p>
<p class="p p3">In the 8 mg/kg cohort of the Phase 1 study, we conducted an immune challenge with KLH, a scaffold protein that was injected subcutaneously and the control subject with AT-1501 there was a robust antibody response to foreign KLH protein, which peaked at 15-days. AT-1501, however, completely abrogated an immune response to KLH in two of the three treated subjects.</p>
<p class="p p3">We have selected our indications based on preclinical data that was generated either our molecule or historical anti-CD40 ligand molecules, preclinical data in rodents, pigs, and non-human primates suggest the blocking CD40 ligand is the most efficacious way to prevent acute and long-term transplant rejection and renal, corneal and islet cell transplant, and in some cases can induce long-term transplant tolerance.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">Blocking CD40 ligand has also been shown to be more effective at preventing allograft transplant rejection compared to blocking CD40. The ability to prevent acute and chronic transplant rejection in the absence of calcineurin inhibitors has the potential to transform the clinical management of preventing graft rejection mitigating nephrotoxicity, increased opportunistic infections, and increased malignancies associated with calcineurin inhibitors or CNIs.</p>
<p class="p p4">Islet cell transplantation has the same upside as described for organ transplant with the additional ability to eliminate the toxicity of CNIs specifically on transplanted islet cells. Chronic exposure to CNIs an organ transplant is associated with an increase in Type 1 diabetes. This is due to the toxicity of CNIs on beta cells in the pancreas.</p>
<p class="p p4">Similarly, CNIs are toxic to transmitted islet cells, up to 50% of transplanted islet cells may die within three days of transplantation, in part due to CNI toxicity, thus exposing subjects for risk of transplant rejection and requiring multiple islet cell transplants in order to obtain a sufficient islet cell mass to eliminate the requirement for exogenous insulin.</p>
<p class="p p4">And autoimmunity, we are focusing on autoimmune nephritis. There was a long history of preclinical and clinical data demonstrating the blocking CD40 signaling ameliorates disease progression, modifies biomarkers of disease and improves renal function and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or FSGS in lupus nephritis. Soluble CD40 ligand also often correlates with disease flares and autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p class="p p4">The clinical development program and ALS is based on positive preclinical data and a rodent model of ALS conducted at the ALS Therapy Development Institute or ALS TDI. ALS TDI has screened approximately 500 compounds and rodent models of ALS and blocking CD45 and function is one of only four or five compounds that slow disease progression, improve survival and improves muscle function in this model. Similarly to how soluble CD40 ligand can correlate with flares and autoimmune diseases, soluble CD40 ligand is also correlated with disease progression in ALS.</p>
<p class="p p4">Novus is poised to initiate up to four Phase 2 clinical studies from now until mid-2021. The Phase 2 study in ALS which was paused in the early phase of COVID-19 is expected to start enrolling in the next month. While we do not expect to have internal readouts in the ALS study, the studies in islet cell transplantation, renal transplantation and autoimmune nephritis have opportunities for interim analysis prior to top line data.</p>
<p class="p p4">We are focusing on real transplantation since it is a well established procedure with an estimated 23,000 transplants performed in 2019 in the United States, and a three to five year waiting list of over 90,000 people. 10% to 15% of all renal transplants are re-transplants due to long-term graft failure. CNIs were a critical component of immunosuppressive regimens to prevent acute and long term transplant rejection.</p>
<p class="p p4">However, chronic exposure to certain CNIs including tacrolimus is associated with nephrotoxicity, an increase in opportunistic infections, increased malignancies, and an increase in Type 1 diabetes due to pancreatic beta cell toxicity. These liabilities may result in a requirement for reduced exposures to CNIs over long periods of time and a decrease in the ability to prevent long-term rejection.</p>
<p class="p p4">We believe that AT-1501 in combination with the elimination of CNIs from renal transplant procedures may increase long-term graft survival and significantly eliminate the toxicities associated with long-term exposures to CNIs. Several historical studies have described the effect of anti-CD40 ligand antibodies in non-human primate models of renal transplant and showing that anti-CD40 ligand therapy can prevent both acute rejection and long-term reduction in non-human primates.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">In these models, the lack of immunosuppressive treatment results in acute transplant rejection in 14 days. Chronic administration of anti-CD40 ligand antibodies as a monotherapy for five months wherever inhibits transplant rejection with good kidney function as measured by proteinuria with no adverse events.</p>
<p class="p p5">In order to study anti-CD40 ligand treatments in combination with current immunosuppressive regimens, the anti-CD40 ligand was administered together with a brief course of bleselumab plus mycophenolate mofetil and salmeterol for three months in another historical study, animals in the combination of group had immune survival of greater than 300 days.</p>
<p class="p p5">There is currently a limited number of islet cell transplants occurring in the United States, yet there are over 1 million people in the U.S. with Type 1 diabetes. An estimated 70,000 people with Type 1 Diabetes are in the so-called brutal phase of the disease, chronically taking exogamous insulin for decades, suffering from glycemic unawareness and at risk for significant comorbidities. Adoption of islet cell transplant as a treatment option for Type 1 diabetes has had hampered toxicity associated with the CNIs that are required to prevent Islet cell rejection yet results in acute islet cell loss and dysfunction.</p>
<p class="p p5">CNI toxicity and islet cell loss often require multiple islet cell transplants to eliminate the necessity for exogenous insulin. The toxicities associated with CNIs are also increased the risk of severe renal dysfunction in the patient population where renal function is already compromised. The elimination of CNIs and islet cell transplant [indiscernible] potentially transform treatment options for people living with Type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p class="p p5">Historical studies in non-human primate models of islet cell transplant show the treatment with anti-CD40 ligand antibodies induces long-term islet cell function and graft survival even as a monotherapy in the absence of any additional immunosuppressive agents. We've expanded on these early observations with AT-1501 in a non-human primate model of islet cell transplant, comparing the safety and efficacy of AT-1501, with an immunosuppressant regimen containing CNIs.</p>
<p class="p p5">Animals undergone islet cell transplant with AT-1501 monotherapy had significantly higher C-peptide levels immediately after transplant. The islets with AT-1501 monotherapy appeared healthier and could dynamically since glucose levels demonstrated by a functional increase in C-peptide levels after eating. Animals treated with AT-1501 had better graft function, improved appetite, and significant waking a year after transplant compared to standard immunosuppressive regiments were acute rejection was often observed.</p>
<p class="p p5">Systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE is one of the largest autoimmune populations globally with between an estimated 65,000 and 120,000 patients in the United States, up to 40% of people with SLE developed lupus nephritis may experience kidney dysfunction, requirement for dialysis and end-stage renal disease. Similarly, FSGS as an autoimmune nephritis resulting from podocyte injury associated with immune complex formation in the primary light. FSGS is also an orphan disease with a prevalence of 40,000 people in the U.S. and variable progression to end stage renal failure.</p>
<p class="p p5">Proteinuria is often utilized as a biomarker of kidney dysfunction and can be referenced for patient's trifurcation as well as a surrogate marker of improvements in kidney function. There are currently no FDA approved treatments for FSGS or lupus nephritis with systemic steroids and CNIs being most widely prescribed. There was a long history of modulating CD40 ligand activity in preclinical models of lupus nephritis and glomerulosclerosis with anti-CD40 ligand antibodies.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">Anti-CD40 ligand antibodies ameliorate disease progression and improve survival in the rodent FNF in NZB NZW genetic models of SLE. There is also pathological improvement of fibrosis in the kidney and spleen, improvements in kidney function and reduction of immune cell infiltrate into the kidney. Systemic biomarkers of lupus such as anti-double stranded DNA antibodies are also reduced with the anti-CD40 ligand treatment.</p>
<p class="p p6">Similar data has also been described in preclinical models of FSGS. Anti-CD40 ligand treatment in kidney dysfunction as measured by a reduction in proteinuria and improve kidney function appears immediately by decreased immune cell infiltration into glomeruli. ALS is an orphan disease with approximately 5,000 new cases diagnosed in the U.S. annually and a prevalence of 30,000 cases overall. ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease due to loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="p p6">Despite two approved drugs, the median survival remains only three to five years after symptom onset. The ALS therapy development and to see discover the activation of the co-stimulatory pathway and activation of CD-40 ligand signaling at symptom onset in skeletal muscle, brain and sciatic neural in a rodent model of ALS. Using murine antibody to block CD-40 ligand function in mice, they further demonstrated blocking CD-40 ligand signaling improve muscle function, slows disease progression and improve survival.</p>
<p class="p p6">These clinical manifestations are due to reduced immune cells infiltrated macrophages into the skeletal muscle in the destroying of denervated nerves. The plasticity of the nervous system to repair itself in the absence of this immune cell attack results in improved neuromuscular junction occupancy and improved muscle function. Blocking CD-40 ligand signaling also prevents pro-inflammatory polarization of lymphocytes, reducing inflammation and improved motor neuron survival in rodent models of ALS.</p>
<p class="p p6">The Company is initiating a Phase 2 study of AT-1501 in people living with ALS, with enrollments expected to begin in the next month. The trial is a 12-week, open label, dose escalating safety biomarker study with three doses of AT-1501. The endpoints of the study are safety and tolerability changes in pro-inflammatory biomarkers as well as changes in neurofilament light chain. Exploratory clinical endpoints will also be assessed.</p>
<p class="p p6">I'd like to finish my presentation by echoing DA's earlier sentiment and expressing my excitement to have joined Novus and to further develop of AT-1501.</p>
<p class="p p6">With that, I'll turn the call back to DA.</p>
