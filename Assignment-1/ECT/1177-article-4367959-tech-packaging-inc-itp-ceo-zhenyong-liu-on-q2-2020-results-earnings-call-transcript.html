<p class="p p1"><strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Despite our sales and operations were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first quarter we made improvements in the second quarter as our people products business recovered as new face mask business launched in April generated revenue of $0.9 million with gross margin of 59.5% in the second quarter.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Our tissue paper continued 100 growth in revenue and hit a historical high with sales volume up 2,884 tons. Due to the pandemic impact to downstream industry we experienced a 13% to 21% decrease in ASP over all paper products categories. However, except for offset printing paper we did not see much sales volume fluctuation from our people products during the second quarter. So we believe the underlying demand for our products remains strong and we expect the overall performance will continue to be improved as the ASP for all paper products becomes stabilized when the pandemic economy recovery continues through the whole industry [gene].</p>
<p class="p p2">Now I will turn the call over to our CFO, Ms. Jing Hao who will review and comment on the second quarter financial results. Her comments will be delivered in English by my colleague Janice Wang. Jenice, please go ahead.</p>
