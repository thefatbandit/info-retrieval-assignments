<p class="p p1"><strong>Jeremy Campbell</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Alright. We are about to begin here, Michael. Alright. Sorry, everybody, for the tech delays here. It’s the pleasures of running the conference virtually in this format these days. But I'm going to continue rolling on here. I'm Jeremy Campbell. I cover the exchanges, brokers and asset managers sector here at Barclays. Continuing with the alternative asset managers under coverage, it's absolutely my pleasure to welcome Michael Chae, the CFO of Blackstone to our Global Financial Services Conference. Welcome, Michael.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Michael Chae</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Hi, Jeremy. Good morning.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Jeremy Campbell </strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning. Now Michael has been with the firm for 23 years, has held a broad range of leadership roles, including Head of International Private Equity and Head of Private Equity for Asia-Pac. I think let's kick it off here, Michael. You've been at Blackstone for 22 years. You seem to grow to over [$560 billion] of AUM and over $60 billion in market cap. I guess just from a high level viewpoint here, in your experience, what's so special about Blackstone and what's driven its success and how do you think it'll keep kind of moving in that direction going forward?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Chae</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Sure. Well, Jeremy, thanks and it's great to be with you and with the whole audience virtually, hopefully next year in-person. But that question gets at a topic that I never tire of talking about. And so, I think in terms of key ingredients behind our success: First, I'd highlight two dynamics. One, performance; and the other innovation. And I think it's distinctive in the investment business to be a firm that does both well, and I think we've demonstrated over 35 years that we are that, and the combination of being able to do both well really has been the engine of our growth over that time period. And so, with respect to performance, we talked about it before, but that's where it all begins and ends. If you look at our private equity and real estate drawdown funds over multiple decades, very consistent performance through cycles, 14% to 15% returns, net of all fees, 2 to 2.2 times realized multiple investment capital consistently through our history.</p>
<p class="p p1">And with respect to innovation, we've demonstrated a pretty exceptional track record I think of leveraging existing capabilities, and investment strategies and businesses, and being able to leverage them into -- and expand into natural adjacencies as well as altogether new areas, and achieve scale rapidly in that and achieve winning businesses. And so, we see it as a virtuous circle, which we've talked about in the past, performance over 35 years begets and engenders deep investor trust, that in turn gives us the power and the backing and the platform to innovate and allows us to scale new business successfully, and as I said, quite rapidly. And so, that capability and that track record, and that trust is in our view a major competitive advantage. And virtually all the strategies we started over the last decade have become market leaders, number one in most cases, or one of the top few, I think in all cases. </p>
<p class="p p1">And in terms of sustainability, is that sustainable? Yes, it is. But we don't take it for granted. In fact, we are sort of obsessed over ensuring that, that it is. And so, in terms of what's behind that view: First, at a sort of big picture level, this is an industry with enormous secular tailwinds as I think everyone in the audience knows, in which we’ve built a leading brand and market position over three and a half decades. Second, as I said, we've created true scale and huge, what I would call surface area, across our businesses and across the firm, that's a real competitive edge. But what has and really will sustain us when we talk about sustaining any kind of investment services business is our culture, which we do think is pretty special. And we all sort of have different ways of telling the story and what we see in our culture. But for me first it’s a very rigorous and honest culture, both intellectual honesty, personal honesty and it’s full of -- it's organization full of pretty nice people actually. It's exceptionally well integrated with the culture of lightening-fast communications and intellectual capital sharing. And it's a real meritocracy. I mean, that's probably the thing I'd put above all else. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">It doesn't matter whether you joined the firm 23 years ago, like I did, or 23 months ago, or 23 days ago, the combination of the underlying growth of the firm and our business overall these years and being in my view a true meritocracy equals and creates unended -- unending and uncapped opportunities for people to advance and have rewarding and really satisfying careers. And I think the proof of that is that, this lets us attract and retain great talent. We like talking about the statistic, having 19,000 or so applicants this past year for 93 first year analyst positions to be ranked the number one best place to work in our category, I think three years in a row. Those are all I think evidence of what I'm talking about.</p>
<p class="p p2">So you can see I'm just a little bit proud of our firm after all this time, I still feel lucky to work here every day I walk in, and I'm glad to say I did walk into our office today and I'm really excited about the future. We think our best years are ahead of us.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">And from the audience, we also have response questions for you, in the left hand side bar, I think the one that Michael and Weston and the team would be all interested in would be, how you are positioned with Blackstone stock, so have overweight, equal-weight, underweight or not involved. So if you want to register those as we continue the conversation, it’d be fantastic. And so, Michael, I guess moving on, you were very involved in setting the FRE targets. And on a quarterly runway basis at least, you're kind of ahead of schedule and just under like the $2 three year FRE target you guys targeted back in fall of 2018. So I guess first thing first, as we sit here today, do you see any risks to achieving that goal?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Chae</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, what I'd say is, first of all, I think, we tend to think the best way to look at FRE is on an annual or 12 month basis. And on that basis, as of the end of the second quarter, as you know, our LTM FRE was a $1.67 per share, which is up 46% since Investor Day. I think on Investor Day we did sort of talk about a target of 50% plus growth in sort of that two year timeframe. What I'd say is that we're firmly on the path despite everything that's happened in the world and we're very confident about the trajectory from here.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">And so, don't worry, Michael, I am not going to ask you for FRE firm guidance updates here. But, you know, since you are so involved to help setting these big growth goals, as we look forward over the next several years from this point, do you see similar market dynamics and investor demand for private investment strategies that would continue to support this very robust mid-teens percentage compound annual growth FRE growth over time?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Chae</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Look, stepping back the longer view, our fee-earning AUM and FRE growth has been robust and consistent over many, many years, mid-teens annual growth since our IPO basically. In terms of that Investor Day roadmap, you referenced, I think we do believe we got the architecture of that roadmap right, and it remains fully in place. All the factors are in place to continue to drive that sort of attractive growth. Secular tailwinds, the ability to drive product and channel expansion, stable pricing, and continued operating leverage, those are the things I talked about in September 2018, and those remain very much in place and in force. </p>
<p class="p p2">The numerous strategic initiatives we talked about back then, whether it's Core+ real estate, secondaries, infrastructure, life sciences, growth equity, insurance, retail, basically all have blossomed or continued to blossom since then. Some had already been launched when we met that day. Some were -- we were sort of on the doorstep and some were still ideas we were working on. So we think we have long and compelling runways ahead of us in all those strategies and channels and then some. So we're feeling very good about that.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">Now at the same time, and this is another really big positive, I'd say in the couple of years since then, with respect to the TAM or total addressable market, sort of picture, frankly, it's only gotten better and more promising over kind of the short and I think long run. Because the challenge to investors globally, as we all know, of finding returns and yield in the face of ultra-low interest rates has only intensified and deepened since then, like profoundly. And that's a profound multi-trillion dollar problem for global investors and the largest global pools of capital in the world. And given our position in alternatives and our sort of array of strategies and the performance over time, we think we're the number one solutions provider to that multi-trillion dollar global problem. And that makes the backdrop only more supportive of our industry and our business and makes us only I think more well-positioned.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Got it. And I guess let's just pivot over to deployment for a second here. I think the team in the past has said that transaction activity has been muted, given the high degree of uncertainty in the market, and that's impacted deployment so far this year. Obviously, we've had a lot of chop with everything going on. Have you seen activity pick up as we kind of return -- at least in the public market has obviously seen a pretty big rally back and the economy starts to return a little bit back toward normal? Or are sellers still kind of remaining cautious and waiting for kind of a healthier backdrop?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Chae </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. I think -- well, look, I'd say it's been taken off mute and if it was sort of on mute before, maybe a bit of an apropos in term. And pipelines and activities, for sure, have been building. We see that. But I'd say it's still an unfolding process, and there are a number of dynamics at work that cut different ways as it relates to activity levels, healthy capital markets on the one hand, wide dispersion of impact on businesses in the real economy at the same time. And even now perhaps of the looming sort of specter politics, tax planning, et cetera, as well. So it's all, I think, evolving as we sort of speak. And while the capital markets have strengthened, obviously, in a big way, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there, depending on the business and sector. And I'd say the higher level of uncertainty about the impact of COVID on a particular business, the harder it is to cross a trade between buyers and non-distressed sellers. </p>
<p class="p p3">So with that said, yes, we are seeing healthier deal pipelines overall, and we had a pretty busy August and -- July and August, as people may have read about. And I think stepping back, what's really on display, I think is -- with respect to our firm, is that enormous surface area of the firm and its capabilities and sort of the range of ways we have to deploy capital across sectors and geographies and asset classes and up and down the risk/return spectrum.</p>
<p class="p p3">And particularly environment -- in environments like this, that diversity of strategies and that flexibility of capital really shows its value. So recent investments of ours, I think, have reflected a very thematic approach, especially as it relates to certain themes or sectors like e-commerce, content creation, digital infrastructure, life sciences and healthcare for sure, Asia to some degree. And almost always where the opportunity for our capital to bring value add from us and our firm capabilities was significant. So that's, I think, the sort of the backdrop, and I think you are seeing more things to do, but it's still a mixed and evolving picture.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And then I guess, you've seen this in the public markets with the bifurcation of things that are socially distant, work from home, I mean literally what we're doing right now on Zoom versus some of the impacted industries like restaurants, gyms, et cetera. I know you're a CFO now, but you used to be on the investment team. So maybe if you can kind of give us like the Blackstone thought process of how you approach COVID-impacted industries or balance valuations against maybe even lack of any sort of transparency and visibility around future cash flow streams in some of these impacted industries?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Chae</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. We're all sorting through that, and there's not one single framework or model for looking at things, and it depends on your strategy. But a few observations. One obvious frame is cyclical versus secular disruption. And so like many of my colleagues -- I remember as a senior investor and deal person before, from prior cycles like 2008, how severe cyclical downturns accelerate existing secular trends. You saw that, for example, in '08, the aftermath and sort of traditional ad-based and media businesses back then. And this time, of course, the acceleration is being seen in a much more dramatic way because the digital transformation fundamentally was already -- that was already underway was far more advanced and disruptive. So with that backdrop, I'd say one way to look at it is sort of maybe three buckets of companies and opportunities.</p>
<p class="p p4">The first bucket, businesses or assets with secular growth that may even be accelerating in terms of those trends. Those aren't generally cheap but have remained, as I sort of just referenced, a top priority for us. And with our platform and our reach and our scale and our value-added capital, we have been finding a number of ways to express our key themes in those areas. We've done a few actually convertible preferreds in companies, whether it's in the sort of digital infrastructure area or in the life science, logistics area in the last month or so. And even though those are very much on trend with great businesses, they need capital, and we will be able to invest in a sort of structured equity. And just in that time period, I've seen sort of 20% to 50% type appreciation in stock, and that's good for the company and also good for us, obviously.</p>
<p class="p p4">Second, conversely, they're the secularly challenged businesses. And what I'd say is, for us, life is probably too short because what appears to be potentially cheap tends to be a value trap because the pace of change and disruption is just too quick for a long-term investor like us. We can't just sort of get in and out of these things. </p>
<p class="p p4">And then there's a third group, which is, I think, even trickier, which is where there's a secular theme that we believe in and we believed in for a while probably, but that's been interrupted. For example, certain location-based businesses and where the business probably is currently suffering to some degree. And if we can quantify and capitalize normalized earnings, for businesses like that, cheaply enough to give us a margin of safety for the inherent uncertainty of the time to full recovery, that's something we are definitely looking to do and our teams are spending a lot of time on.</p>
<p class="p p4">So overall, I'd say, maintaining discipline in the face of that is key, and that's what our long-term locked up capital model allows us to do and to be. And on the other side of that, we have enormous firepower, $156 billion of dry powder to execute with speed and certainty and in scale when we see something we like.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Thanks. And I think that was a really helpful backdrop from the deployment angle. But let's kind of turn it around maybe on your own book of business right now. COVID has taken a crisis in some of the industries. But I think, as we understand it, a good portion of your portfolio is in COVID-resilient industry. So can you just remind us about how your portfolio is positioned for this environment and maybe touch on how it's performing right now?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Chae</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Sure, Jeremy. And we talked -- we tried to give this kind of a pretty full treatment on our second quarter earnings call. And -- but I'm happy to recap and sort of update that narrative in a way. So look, sector selection has been everything for all investors, including us, especially in this time. If you walk through some of our businesses, big businesses, you take real estate, our biggest business in terms of earnings contribution, 80% of that portfolio, as we talked about, is in very resilient sectors, including logistics and most of our residential multi-family assets and also our office holdings. I think that's reflected in different ways, including the fact that our appreciation over sort of a 12-month period as of the end of June was about 1,300 basis points better than the REIT Index, for example.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">In Private Equity, Corporate Private Equity, in particular, one way to be even more granular about it is if you look at our BCP VI and VII funds, our two major vintages that are fully invested from the past decade, there in BCP VII you see a -- similarly, as sort of that 80% I mentioned in real estate, a strong resilient portfolio, a quite strong concentration in technology and tech-enabled businesses, which are performing well, whether it's Refinitiv or MagicLab also known as Bumble, Ultimate Software and so on and many others. BCP VI, which is a prior fund, that is a mature and liquid portfolio with a significant concentration of public stocks, such as Cheniere, which we announced a few weeks ago, we are monetizing. So that is a fairly important picture and story as well.</p>
<p class="p p5">Life Sciences, which we obviously started a business that's grown rapidly to $4.5 billion, recent fund raise. And there's also -- that sector, we're also playing in other parts of the firm. That's a highly uncorrelated asset class. And in fact, it's very much on trend in many ways of what's going on. </p>
<p class="p p5">And in Credit, if you look at the leveraged finance market, leveraged loans and high yield are basically back to within a couple of points of their pre-COVID level, so 94 to 95 today relative to 97 or so at the beginning of the year versus the -- in terms of the indices and back from lows of like 76 in March. So our portfolio both benefits from that overall. But also given our own credit selection and experience, our metrics are particularly strong. So for example, in our liquid credit strategies area, that leveraged loan business, the portfolio default rate is a -- it has been historically, it is now a fraction of the market. So our LTM default rate as of the end of the second quarter was 0.2% compared to about 3.7% for the market. So that shows both the overall massive recovery in that space and then our particular relative performance.</p>
<p class="p p5">Now obviously, there are challenged areas, retail, travel-related businesses, energy, which we talked a lot about in the first quarter, where there are uncertainties and challenges, but we do think that's a manageably sort of limited part of our portfolio overall as a firm. </p>
<p class="p p5">So overall, while the environment continues to be uncertain, we think we have a portfolio that in aggregate is not only resilient but is positioned to drive good performance going forward.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Great. And then I think just circling back and zooming in a little bit more on real estate. Obviously, there's this narrative out there with everybody kind of working from home and then how troubled real estate is. But I think something that investors or people might miss is that you guys aren't just buying the market, your kind of -- your footprint is in some of these more resilient type industries. So I know you touched a little bit on how that's performing, but maybe taking a step back and thinking about real estate, what's the high level opportunity for growth from real estate from here? And maybe if you have any more granular color on what's going on in the portfolio right now. I think tying those two elements together is what I think a lot of investors are looking for.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Chae </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. Look, you've said it in your question. And again, I think our performance and exposures in real estate highlight our careful sector selection over many years now. And while there's a -- I think it's important, while there's a tendency -- there's been a tendency to speak maybe defensively about that, I would turn it around and say that we feel from a value appreciation standpoint over time, there's significant upside from here. Large scale, high-quality assets that are the best positioned in the sector with secular growth, rising tenant demand and yield generation in this ultra-low rate environment, we think will increasingly over time lead to both compressing financing costs for assets like that, and then ultimately, that will be reflected in cap rates and the value of these types of assets. So if you go through it quickly, the 80% I mentioned before breaks down into three key areas: logistics, office and multi-family housing. Logistics remains our firm overall, I think our highest conviction theme. It's over a third of the real estate portfolio, acquired over 1 billion square feet over the last decade, real tailwinds in terms of e-commerce demand and so forth.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">Transaction activity we would say in the sector has resumed to some degree, with pricing in some cases exceeding pre-COVID levels. And e-commerce sales, as I mentioned, up sort of 70% in U.S. in June, 73% in the UK, significantly in China and so forth. </p>
<p class="p p6">On office, which I know a lot of people want to hear about and talk about and they should. If you take a step back, we'd say not all office is [creativity]. And 90% or so of our office fair market value is in the following areas: So life sciences office, where we're the couple of biggest landlords to that industry in the U.S., where lab office leasing activity has been very steady year-over-year throughout the pandemic. We have a well-known fast-growing India office platform, much of which is publicly traded global technology tenants, where -- which are -- which -- and likely to further benefit in an environment where international corporates want to manage their cost structures. Select European markets that are attractive with low vacancies and high leasing activities such as Berlin and Stockholm. West Coast office, where we're one of the largest landlords, for example, to content creators and Southern California, and we just finished to deal on that front.</p>
<p class="p p6">And so, as a result of having an office portfolio constructed that way, second quarter rent collections were down really only modestly across the portfolio. And while we're sober on the outlook for certain U.S. cities in terms of office which will face significant headwinds near term, it's a relatively small part of our portfolio. </p>
<p class="p p6">And then finally, on rental housing, a key global theme, suburban orientation, high-quality garden-style apartments, an orientation towards the so-called smile states. And again, those are performing very well in terms of collections and activity. </p>
<p class="p p6">So hotel and retail, more challenged parts of the industry, both are about sort of mid-single-digit type percentage exposures for our firm. And even within that, particularly hotels, we think will come back over time. And we're pleased with the portfolio we have. And then on retail, even though there are real fundamental headwinds there, where we are within that, we think is a better place to be, both in the U.S. where we own no enclosed malls, for example, and also in Asia. So that's sort of the picture. </p>
<p class="p p6">Now in terms of the growth from here for real estate, what I'd say is, again, those meta themes of the first three globally for investors in the context of an enormous global market, over $200 trillion, we're a very small part of that still, as big as our business has gotten. And our position as an investor over the last 25 years with the confidence of the institutional and individual clients we have puts us in great position. So we see meaningful growth potential for the business from here, particularly as it relates to perpetual capital platforms, such as our Core+ platform, including BREIT, which we think will likely be a bigger part of the whole over time given the demand and fundamentals. There's a large opportunity for those products globally, both in terms of investing abroad and also in terms of raising money abroad, which is, I think, only partially tapped right now.</p>
<p class="p p6">And then also in terms of real estate debt and credit, we've sort of quietly built a $25 billion AUM business in that area. We mentioned on our earnings call, we're in the final stages of raising our fourth real estate debt fund, which was at $6 billion as of the end of June and is -- we expect to have had a final close this quarter.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Got it. Great. And I think continuing with the theme here around the low yield environment, let's just chat a little bit about insurance maybe for a moment, but I know we're running up a little bit against time here before we close out. But just on insurance, obviously, it's a common -- it's a theme that keeps popping up because all of the alt peers at this point have some sort of insurance footprint. I know Blackstone obviously has strong relationships in the industry, and notably, FG out there as well. I know everybody that tuned in today sees the value here for alts managers, especially capping this market of low yields. So I guess maybe -- and I know, I think, Jon, on the last earnings call said stay tuned for Blackstone as well. So maybe just first, what's your high-level opportunity and outlook on the insurance market? And how would you look to kind of expand the relationships well from the Blackstone side of things?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Chae </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Look, I mean, in a nutshell, our business right now is $62 billion of total insurance AUM, including FG. A very, very small piece of the overall addressable market and the secular tailwinds to -- for alternatives to serve that market are dramatic. On FG, our partnership began in 2017, highly successful, beneficial for all. They remain our largest insurance client. We improved the yield of that -- of their portfolio by about 50 basis points and the ROE by about 500 basis points in a period of declining rates and also with ratings upgrades during that time period. And while our Tac Opps and GSO investments were monetized, and we always expected they would be, we extended and strengthened the asset management relationship there and continue to manage that portfolio and look forward to continuing and expanding that relationship over the long-term. </p>
<p class="p p7">On also inorganic growth, we're obviously building our insurance business to support a much larger asset base. We have a terrific leader of the business, Gilles Dellaert, who joined about 6 months ago. And so, do we see opportunities to grow and grow inorganically? The short answer is, yes, we do.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Great. And then I think just maybe closing here since we're pushing up against time. Everything we've talked about today, right, you've clearly outlined a lot of growth drivers here, but how does this all translate to the stock? The stock is up strongly since your C-Corp conversion last summertime, but similar to peers that had pulled back recently. I guess at this ending point, we're still doing a lot of 1-on-1s, and we probably have a lot of people, 44% based on the polling that are currently uninvolved in Blackstone stock right now. So what gives you confidence that this is a really good entry point for investors? And what do you want to message to them here as we close out this session? </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Chae </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Sure. Well, 44% sounds like a great opportunity and challenge, so. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Exactly. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Chae </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, look, pre-conversion, just setting back, we were too hard to own. And despite what we thought was our exceptional performance and growth and position in our industry. Since we converted, made ourselves easier to own, we've seen those benefits. We've seen sort of the portion of our ownership in the hands of long-only investors and index funds basically double from around 20% of the float to over 40%. We think there's still a long way to go on that front. And there's been, obviously, I think, a re-rating from a valuation standpoint over that time period. But looking ahead, we think it's early days in that re-rating process. </p>
<p class="p p7">We feel great about our business, as I've talked about today, tremendous secular growth. And we're the clear market leader in that sector. Extraordinary brand equity built up over 35 years, the most diverse platform, culture of innovation, many avenues for continued growth, and rising earnings power. So we've talked, as you noted, about $2 a share in FRE on the way, an ongoing mix shift over time to FRE as in terms of the mix of our earnings. And then we make the case, that's the highest quality earning stream in financial services. </p>
<p class="p p7">So in terms of valuation, multiple entry points. We trade at a discount to the market today and still well below other high quality, high-growth financials, which range from sort of the mid- to high 20s to low 40s as a PE multiple. Our dividend yield at the same time is more than double the S&amp;P, approximately or actually a little bit more than the S&amp;P. And across key metrics, sort of measuring quality, whether it's long-term revenue and earnings growth, operating margins, dividend yield. Among the largest U.S. public companies, we're in the top quartile in every one of those categories. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">So fundamentally, we really like our position and have great conviction in our prospects. Our employees continue to own almost half the stock. And we think as a firm we've established ourselves as not just a leading alternatives business, not just a leading financial services company but as a leading large public company. And over time, as we continue to perform, we think our stock should increasingly be valued like one of them. So we've made some progress on that front, but we think there's a long way to go. </p>
