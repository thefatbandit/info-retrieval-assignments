<p class="p p1"><strong>Vernon Bernardino</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good afternoon everyone and welcome back to the H.C. Wainwright 22nd Annual Global Healthcare Conference. My name is Vernon Bernardino and I’m an H.C. Wainwright’s Senior Analyst. We hope you’ve had a good day at our conference and are taking full advantage of the almost 200 healthcare company sessions just today alone. Please be sure not to miss our virtual entertainment event this evening at six o'clock, it's going to be fantastic. With that said, I'd like to introduce our next presentation and welcome Dr. John Scarlett, President and CEO of Geron which is a late stage clinical stage first-in-class telomerase inhibitor named imetelstat.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>John Scarlett</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thanks very much, Vernon. I’m very happy to be here and thank the organizers in at Wainwright for inviting us.</p>
<p class="p p1">I'll do a quick forward-looking statement. Please note that the session will contain forward-looking statements relating to our plans, expectations, timelines, beliefs, statements of potentiality and projections. These include timelines for completion of enrolment and top line results from the Phase III Imerge trial and for the planned Phase III refractory MF trial that imetelstat has potential disease modifying activity.</p>
<p class="p p1">Imetelstat’s U.S. revenue potential in the patent protection for imetelstat is expected to last until 2033. These and other forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from those in terms of forward-looking statements and include without limitation, those regarding that we may be unable to overcome all clinical safety, efficacy, technical, scientific, operational, manufacturing and regulatory challenges to enable expected timelines for Imerge and refractory MF trial that regulatory authorities may not permit the further development of Imetelstat on a timely basis or at all that Geron maybe unable to maintain patent protection or obtain its revenue projections and COVID-19 pandemic may significantly impact the timelines for both enrolment and the results of the clinical trials.</p>
<p class="p p1">A detailed information on these risks are included and how they may differ materially from those statements are explained under the heading Risk Factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30 2020 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they're made and the facts and assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements. So thank you all very much for joining us. This is a quick snapshot of the company. We're going to do this as an accelerated 20 minute presentation. Actually, it'll be a few minutes less probably.</p>
<p class="p p1">First of all, this is as Vernon mentioned, the first-in-class telomerase inhibitor, this drug imetelstat clearly has an unique mechanism of action and I will speak to that in a subsequent slide. We have a compelling and differentiating Phase III data in lower risk MDS specifically with regard to the durability 29% of patients with transfusion for greater than one year. We think that this is the most important quality of the drug in terms of how it will be perceived in the marketplace and how it will gain hopefully appropriate market share.</p>
<p class="p p1">In MF, we have 28.1 month median OS in patients with relapsed and refractory to JAK inhibitor and that compares very favorably to historical calls of 14 to 16 months. We'll speak briefly about that. We do have two Phase II trials with registrational intent that are ongoing. Both will be discussed in more detail, the important comment is that we expect completion of enrollment into Phase III lower risk MDS study and by the end of the first quarter of 2021 with top line results expected in the second half of 2022 and the Phase III study with MF, we will describe again in more detail.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">We expect to open the trial in the first quarter of 2021 and complete enrollment in the second half of 2022 with an interim analysis based in the first half of 2023 and final top line results in the first half of 2024. We have a very highly experienced clinical regulatory team experienced in developing therapies for hematologic malignancies and these include employees in clinical regulatory statistics, translational science and commercial who guided the earlier development of the drug when it was licensed to Janssen.</p>
<p class="p p2">So this is a brief comment on the structure of the molecule. It's a oligonucleotide with a covalently bound lipid tail, I think the important comment is that FDA has granted fast track and orphan drug designations for both lower risk MDS and into high risk MF. We have composition of matter of patent coverages described here. The patent term extension is expected to include a potential five years in the EU until 2029 and until 2030 in the U.S., we have methods of used patents until 2033 for MF in EU and for both MDS and MF in the U.S. until 2033. And we do expect market exclusivity extension related to orphan drug designation in the EU for up to 10 years and in the U.S. for up to seven years.</p>
<p class="p p2">This is a very brief comment on the mechanism of action in hemalignancies, which is quite different than any other drug in that space. First and foremost, this addresses malignant and that is shown in the upper right in which malignant stem cells and progenitor cells of liquid blood cells and in the case of malignant hematopoiesis, which is what we're dealing with here telomerase is continuously up regulated compared to normal stem and progenitor cells where telomerase is only transiently up regulated. Imetelstat selectively targets malignant cells with continuously upgraded regulated telomerase and that induces (inaudible) and enables potential recovery of that.</p>
<p class="p p2">Lower risk MDS, which many of you may be aware of is characterized by a chronic anemia associated with ineffective production of red cells, white cells or platelets, which we would call ineffective hematic wheezes, most of the patients that are in our study are relapsing refractory to erythrocytic stimulating agents and these patients become red blood cell dependent, and it's been very well described by others as well as ourselves that transfusions can result not only in lower quality of life but very significant costs, overload, shorter survival and higher risk of transformation to AML. So avoiding a serial red cell transfusion system is a very important quality. We'll discuss with some of the data, some of the qualities of the drug itself as you can see the opportunities described there to the right.</p>
<p class="p p2">So this is a very high level summary of our Phase II data in lower risk MDS. These we had very high rates of transfusion independence 42% of patients achieved an eight-week period and 68 achieved HIE. The durability is quite remarkable, 29% of the patients in the most recent abstracts that were presented were transfusion free for greater than one month, median duration of transfusion independence is 88 weeks. You can see that we had a similar eight-week TI across both RS positive and RS negative subgroups with no statistical daylight between the two of them.</p>
<p class="p p2">We do have potential disease modifying and pivoting one element of which is described by 75% of the responders had hemoglobin greater than three grams per deciliter, suggesting potential recovery of normal. The safety profile is consistent with previous trials in hematologic myeloid malignancies, 61% had Grade 3, 4 as thrombocytopenia and 55% had Grades 3, 4 neutropenia, however, close to 90% of these all resolved within four weeks.</p>
<p class="p p2">So this slide describes the efficacy differences between (inaudible) which is a product that's recent come on in market as REBLOZYL and imetelstat in the Phase III study of imetelstat for new Phase II. I'd like to point out in particular this area, sorry the eight week, the eight week RBC-TI rate in patients who had a transfusion burden greater than four units per eight weeks. This is the heart of the patient population who remains persistently transfusion dependent and you can see that we enjoyed a slight advantage, 42% eight week TI versus 32%. However, you can see that we have reported not only 24 week TI rates, but one year RBC-TI rate, 29% of patients achieved that that's a quite a remarkable outcome, unaware of any other drug being evaluated in this area that has actually achieved this.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">And you can see the median duration of our RBC-TI was 88 weeks compared to this of 31 weeks. So it's a very effective drug from the perspective in particular durability. So this is the clinical design for the Phase III, it's the same dose schedule primary and secondary endpoints in the same target population described in the upper left as including both RS positive and RS negative patients. Many of our clinical sites participate in Phase II, we continue to expect a completion of enrollment by the end of the first quarter of 2021 with top line results are expected now in the second half of 2022. So I'll not tarry here in the interest of time and go on to the MF story.</p>
<p class="p p3">I think everyone is familiar likely if you’re listening to this talk with MF, there's deep unmet need for therapies that can extend survival and be disease modifying. These are patients who are by and large have failed or become refractory to JAK inhibitors. We had a long standing long running Phase II study that showed fairly dramatic improvement in overall survival 28 months compared to the expected historical controls of 14 to 16 months in patients who became refractory to JAKi. And actually, we've looked at real world data and analyses which help us get to the same answer 12 months from compared to 12 months from the real world data analysis.</p>
<p class="p p3">There was an meaningful improvement in symptoms 32% at 24 weeks achieved the 50% reduction in TSS and we have seen reduction in the various mutations associated as driver mutations with this disease, indicating targeting of underlying safety profile again consistent with prior imetelstat clinical trials, 41% Grade 3 for thrombocytopenia and 32% Grade 3 for neutropenia. Most of these were reversible within four weeks and did not result in meaningful percentages of patients with clinical sequelae.</p>
<p class="p p3">This shows the real world data versus the Imbark Phase II data, the Kaplan-Meier curve on the left shows that it was 33.8 months in patients treated with imetelstat compared to the real world data synthetic control arm of 12 months. This certainly suggests a potential survival benefit and lower risk of death for imetelstat versus VAT in real world data setting. As a result of that, we went to the FDA last year and earlier this year and agreed on a Phase III trial design OS as a primary endpoint. The main trial design is shown in the center of this, the center of this graph, it shows that patients with refractory myelofibrosis as defined in the first bullet of below this, those are patients with inadequate spleen or central responses after treatment with JAKi where greater than six months, including an optimal dose of JAKi for at least two months.</p>
<p class="p p3">So those patients are then randomized to receive either imetelstat at the same upper dose, starting dose that we started in the Phase II study versus BAT, this will be the traditional best available therapy but with the exclusion of JAK inhibitors, the reason JAK inhibitors are excluded is because these patients are by definition refractory to a JAK, to JAKi. Now we do anticipate there will be a interim analysis for OS, this would be event driven in our current estimate for the timing on this is the first half of 2023.</p>
<p class="p p3">We also have a final analysis this will again be event driven an estimate that the timing will be the first half of 2024. The primary endpoint is described above is the overall survival. Secondary endpoints include symptom responses, screen responses, et cetera all of what you would expect in a modern day MF study. And obviously, as shown in the graph, this will be a two for one randomization. We currently expect this study to begin enrolling by the end of the first quarter of 2021 and then you see the outcomes that we’re estimating at the moment in the upper right.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">So these are the plan development priorities for the company and for the drug. We did have in the second quarter of this year, we had the EHA Annual Congress had a number of very nice presentations and posters, they're more mature Imerge Phase II data we discussed today and new analyses in Phase III data that were not discussed because of time in more detail, I'd refer you to our website to see the abstracts and presentations and presentations actually incorporating these data.</p>
<p class="p p4">We do expect to have presentations or posters at ASH this year, we do not expect any new de novo data but further analyses of existing trial results. Lower risk MDS as we talked about, we expect to complete enrollment in the first quarter of 2021 and we're reaffirming that guidance at this moment in time, our top line results that is true, it should come in the second half of 2022. We've been finally the refractory MF, we would expect open that for enrollment screen and enrollment in the first quarter of 2021, complete enrollment by the second half of 2022 and the interim analysis is described in the first half of 2023 or 2024 for the final results.</p>
<p class="p p4">So thank you very much. I would like to -- I think I ended a minute or two early. So if you do have any questions, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:investor@geron.com" rel="nofollow"><u>investor@geron.com</u></a>. Vernon, if you have any final comments or thoughts, I'm happy to have you make them. Otherwise, I think we give everybody a minute or two extra.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p4"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Q - Vernon Bernardino</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, I'd love to actually ask a question. I take advantage of the time that we have. That's extra. We had talked some time ago, not too long ago, actually earlier today, a competitive drug that is doing quite well. What if you could provide your insight as far as the opportunity that it perhaps represent as far as expanding the MDS market?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">John Scarlett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, thanks. So you're referring to luspatercept which was being marketed by Celgene and Acceleron under the trade name REBLOZYL. We actually have watched their launch with great interest. I showed you the side by side comparison of the Phase II versus the Phase III data for the two drugs. As you know, Vernon as many people in call probably know, the low risk MDS market has not had any real new entrants prior to luspatercept since the mid-marks when early to mid when Decitabine and other HNAs begin to be approved. So the market has not really been very mature. And it's been a source of great interest to see how this launch would go. I'm happy to say that it's going well.</p>
<p class="p p4">The second quarter numbers that were reported publicly were $55 million in revenue and some analysts in the street have projected revenues of upwards of $800 million in the third year of marketing by the end of third year of marketing for luspatercept. So we're actually very pleased to see that, we think it validates lower risk MDS is an important underserved market and I think we will have a differentiation particularly on the durability and the ability to treat patients with higher transfusion burdens.</p>
<p class="p p4">So think will compete very enthusiastically in this marketplace and actually wish our competitors continued good luck as they open that marketplace up and help patients who need it very much.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Vernon Bernardino</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, we're excited about the durability results of imetelstat as well. And we look forward to perhaps posting something in the near future that perhaps gives investors a chance to get to know the data better as well as an opportunity to start thinking that perhaps this is a good story now for a story that perhaps emerges more fully in 2021. We want to thank you, John and look forward to the continued progress.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>John Scarlett</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Thank you very much. And thanks again to all the organizers and to the technical who held this meeting, we look forward to meeting with other investors as the year goes on. Thanks.</p>
