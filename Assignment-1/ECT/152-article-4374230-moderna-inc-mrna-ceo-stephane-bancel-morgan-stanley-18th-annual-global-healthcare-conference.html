<p class="p p1"><strong>Matthew Harrison</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning everybody. I'm Matthew Harrison, one of the Bio Analyst here at Morgan. We're pleased to have Moderna up next with their CEO, Stéphane Bancel.</p>
<p class="p p1">Just before we get started, I need to read a disclosure statement and then we'll jump into Q&amp;A.

<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Matthew Harrison</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">So, great. So, Stéphane, thanks for being here with us this morning. I thought maybe to start out. We'll go right into the COVID vaccine questions. You're obviously well into your Phase 3 study at this point. Maybe give people an update on how you're thinking about timelines related to that data?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. Well, good morning, Matthew and good morning, everybody. Thank you for having us. So, on the study indeed as of Friday, as you know, we announced updates every Friday, we were at 23,497 participants that have been enrolled. As you can do the math, from the start of the study, July 27, we now have already a significant number of people that have got their boost. And to remind everybody, this is like the over vaccine participant, an event-driven trial. And so we need to look at the number of cases.</p>
<p class="p p1">As we've said publicly, the first interim data is 53 cases. And so as we've said all along, we anticipate the base plan for readouts in November. There's a high case scenario of earliest in October. I know, people have asked September -- September is not in the cards. The math does not work for September.</p>
<p class="p p1">But the base plant is November, given the epidemiology and the attack rate, which we follow daily and we reforecast daily, the cases and so on internally. We stick to our timelines, November base case.</p>
<p class="p p1">A best case scenario of October, if epidemiology was to release so down drastically, you could see this moving out into December. But I think November still is a very reasonable assumption.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Okay, perfect. And related to enrollment, Pfizer, over the weekend, talked about increasing enrollment to, I think, 44,000 -- I think it was the week before, you talked about slowing enrollment a little bit to have a more diverse population. Would you consider expanding your study? And I guess, relative to Pfizer, do you feel like you're falling behind if you don't expand your study?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">So, it's an interesting question and we are still kind of thinking about it as you said, we decided two weeks ago or four weeks ago, I forgot now, to slow down the study enrollment to ensure we have strong diversity. We have 27% of diversity across the different groups as of last Friday.</p>
<p class="p p1">We think it's very important for the public perception and people in different groups feeling that they have a good understanding of safety and efficacy in their population over vaccine. We don't think that's slowing down on the end of the study, impacts readout because again, the results will be driven by people that were firstly enrolling the study.</p>
<p class="p p1">And so we thought, it was the right trade, both to manage the quality of the study to ensure uptake once the product is potentially approved, but without compromising on time to readout.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">On the decision do we increase or not? We're always talking about it. This is not prompted by the Pfizer decision on Saturday. We've had that discussion a few times. The PCO was known to be careful is as you do it, this does make sense for your study, given that we already, for example, have HIV patients in our case that are enrolled in the study as it is. And then still people get 50% placebo. And so are you better off depending on the time of a readout to just keep it as it is so that people can have access in a high-risk group of vaccine for sure, not a placebo 50%. And so we're still wrestling with it and thinking about it a lot. So if there is an update, we will provide it. But as of today, the plan is to stick to the 30,000 participant Phase 3 study.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">And how you're thinking about children because they obviously, I think, lowered the age to 16, I believe, in that expansion. So how are you guys thinking about the pediatric population?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. So like every vaccine manufacturers, when you go into a Phase 3, you have to kind of commit to FDA that you will do pediatric, which of course, we did. It is our intent to go into the pediatric setting. We want to go at it holistically, we think a year or two, again, going back from 18% to 16% is nice and important. But we want to do pediatric holistically.</p>
<p class="p p2">We want to go down in age. And I think if you look at the vaccine world, there's most probably going to be nine to 17, which is what our people do given the risk profile. And then you kind of age – escalate by age group and potentially those might have to be different in the smaller children.</p>
<p class="p p2">And so we will share our plans there when they are finalized with the agency. But we do want to go down into the pediatric, down to pretty low edge for people on the call that are not aware for hMPV/PIV3 vaccine, we have already gone down to the pediatric setting. So this is not news for Moderna, like other mRNA vaccine companies that are not on pediatric yet. We have already done it with the same lipid system, same chemistry, same manufacturing process as what is in 1273. So I don't see any reason why we should not, at the right time in terms of safety, going to the pediatric.</p>
<p class="p p2">As you know, Matt, the FDA wants to see enough of the database to go down into pediatric for safety or Phase 3. So we're getting pretty close to it now, given the size we have and the repeat dose we have for the people who got the boost. So I think it's a matter of just a very short amount of time before we can share in detail our plans there.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay, great. And then older patients, obviously, a couple of weeks ago, at the ACIP meeting, put out the tighter levels in older adults. How are you thinking about relative efficacy and clinical efficacy, I mean, here, for the older adult compared to maybe the younger, healthier population and do you think that similar titers could lead to better overall efficacy because you think you're going to see the same thing in older adults?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. So that's a great question. So again, for people that are not familiar with the data, which should be published very soon now, a full data set, but people can find the ACIP data on our website. We are very pleased to show like we have shown in our vaccine. Again, this is not new to Moderna mRNA vaccine is that neutralizing antibody level is a similar level between young adults and the elderly, both the 56 to 70 age group and 71 and above.</p>
<p class="p p2">We are very pleased by it, Matt, as you can appreciate, given the high-risk in the elderly population. We believe this will translate into our efficacy in the Phase 3. Of course, we have to show it with the data, but our site understanding is that this will translate.</p>
<p class="p p2">We think that will differentiate our products, potentially materially. As you know, other groups that have reported elderly have seen a material decrease of neutralizing antibody to the young adults. And of course, antibody winds over time, as we all know. And so, we believe that benefit in the elderly that the Moderna vaccine has shown will improve and translate into material efficacy in the Phase 3, again, to be demonstrated in the weeks to come.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. Perfect. Can we talk safety a little bit? Obviously, Astra was in the news last week with a pause on a safety event, which is -- I guess, how do you think about the risk of an event like that in your study? And what measures are in place to manage those risks?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. So, what is really important is safety, is the number one priority for anybody developing a vaccine because, of course, they are given to healthy people. And so, as you know, global industry for a long time has been very developed with the help and coordination with the FDA to monitor safety very precisely.</p>
<p class="p p3">Even the reporting of safety event is a different scale from, let's say, oncology study to a vaccine study, which sometimes people are surprised about when they are specialists in oncology, if you look at the side effects and they are very surprised to see the difference. And again, they are adapted that you want to pick any signal. It's very, very important. So, every vaccine that is in development is always -- they aware -- are also aware to be put on hold as happened to the AstraZeneca program last week.</p>
<p class="p p3">I think it should give everybody comfort that the industry and the regulators are very focused on safety, and that if, or when there is any signal, the right thing to do and the first thing to do is to put everything on hold. Everybody has an outside independent safety advisory board that reviews all the data. And so, we're actually the one making the decision of the company determination. Of course, a lot of time, when it's kind of not very clear, they inform the company and there is a dialogue. But at the end of the day, if a safety committee deems that the study should be paused, it will be paused.</p>
<p class="p p3">And so what happened last week, I would say, is happens frequently in vaccine development. It could happen to us. It could happen to any other vaccine that is in the clinic. It is very hard from this stance, given we have not seen any other data to know if it is an isolated event. That was not correlated to the vaccine. There we opened the study on Saturdays. We just paused for a few days.</p>
<p class="p p3">So, I will conclude from that, that the scientific committee did not find an obvious kind of root cause to the vaccine. I know people have speculated last week is potentially something linked to the adeno technology. Nobody knows given the fact. Okay, we don't have the raw data. And also, people went as far as questioning, is it a risk with a spike as protein.</p>
<p class="p p3">I mean, if you look at the data today, if you look across all the vaccines that are targeting the spike as we are, I think by my backlog and roadmap at north of 70,000 people that have got injected and being participated in those studies. I think there was a safety issue with the spike at 70,000, we’ve already seen it. Again, I mean it's not there. Again, it is possible to have a very, very rare event.</p>
<p class="p p3">But at this stage, I think what happened last week, I think, for me, is good news in terms of -- the vaccine manufacturing, be very careful, and the regulators wanting to make sure that we don't confuse getting a vaccine out as fast as we can. But without cutting corner, cutting corner is not an option.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And have you gone back and looked at your Phase 1 or your Phase 2 safety database or safety database broadly for -- and taking a closer look at any neurological side effects to see if something like this could have been missed? Or have the regulators reached out and asked for you to do that?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So we always do that. It's a very typical practice in the industry. And I would not be surprised if everybody else who is developing a vaccine in the clinic being Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3. Once the news came out of as it you don’t have a safety committee go back. And this what again safety committee are trained to do. So there's nothing to report – not from us. But again, we will take safety as the highest importance in those studies. And any single you have from your vaccine over vaccines prompts you to we look at the entirety of the data.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">And then one final question and then we'll move on. I guess, has the regulator – because there hasn't been an mRNA vaccine approved previously. Has the regulator asked for any special monitoring or special things related to mRNA and the technology broadly that you've been watching for from a safety side effect standpoint?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. So I cannot comment on the field of mRNA because, as you know, Matt, the vaccines are very different. Some companies, it's the first time they're taking a vaccine to the clinic. Some -- I mean, modernized this vaccine we’re taking into the clinic. So in our case, there is no special request by the FDA that will be linked to a new technology. As you knows, those are very big studies, 30,000 participants is a big study. Much bigger and typical vaccine studies for Phase 3 for approval.</p>
<p class="p p4">And so we are monitoring everything closely, but we should not forget that the mRNA molecule is with 6, 8 hour half-life it's gone after 48 hours. With our technology evolution, it doesn't get into new players. So there's no risk that we understand tactically of integration into human DNA, and the lipid as a capital half-life as well. So there's no real reason for us to have long-term safety we always linked to mRNA technology. But again, we don't know what we don't know is injected to healthy people. So we are extremely careful and monitoring our team.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Perfect. And Phase 2, you finished enrolling July 8, I think, would we expect that data shortly? And then, I guess, what do we get out of that data that's different than what you've already disclosed from the various Phase 1 studies?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. So it's a good question. So the Phase 1 had no placebo. NIH decided to do the Phase 1 with no placebo, where Phase 2 has a placebo and the 50 and 100-microgram dose. I remind people the Phase 3 dose is 100-microgram. So I think what you will see is that, first, you're going to see a placebo arm, which I think, again to investors that are not used to look at vaccine data.</p>
<p class="p p4">You will see actually that when put head to head, like we've done with all of our vaccine you know some side effect that we realize is the side effect linked to the vaccine is much lower when you put it in contrast to the placebo because you realize that people get a placebo are paying in their arm because we just put a needle in the arm and you put a volume of water in there. And that even some people on placebo reported in headaches all those side effects that actually not attributed to the vaccine. So I think that's going to be an interesting data set.</p>
<p class="p p4">The other piece is the size. But as you know, this is not an event-driven or efficacy study. It's a Phase 2 that was mostly done to be comfortable for us and for regulators around safety. So 600 people in our Phase 1 including adult was 45 people, so it's a difficult kind of stepping stone into a Phase 3 where you're going to thousands of people participating to the studies. So I think for organic people who don't know the technology well they will have confirmation in the bigger data set of what we saw in the Phase 1.</p>
<p class="p p4">In our Phase 1, we saw all participants, i.e., 100% of participant. I mean neutralizing antibodies at/or above valescent sera. I think you see the same thing. I think what is really nice about mRNA technology, we have a very strong control process like we have at Moderna, is the fact that we have very tight patient-to-patient variability between the lowest and the highest participant neutralizing antibody. We've shown it in CMV. We've shown it in our review certainly across the platform of Moderna.</p>
<p class="p p4">And I think it is true of our mRNA platforms, because of early PKUs, because of the manufacturing process they use. And so, I think people will be happy to see that we've seen -- we have a vaccine. But as you go to a bigger end, you have the same outcome in terms of -- you have high neutralizing antibody to the vast majority, if not all the participant. So it's just a confirmation study, in my opinion.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay, okay. Can we talk about regulatory standard? There's been a lot of debate in the press, et cetera, about what's happening. I mean, what's your thought on what the standard is going to be for an EUA versus a BLA? And it sounds like we should expect some sort of EUA processes as the initial process. So I don't know if you agree with that or not.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. So let me start at the BLA and then let me walk backward into a EUA. So as you know, the FDA has set a very clear guidelines, I think it was in June, around the 50% minimum efficacy expected and around the 30,000 participants kind of minimum study side expected, which for us, industry was very useful to know there was very clear guidelines that we could adhere to and know where the goal post was. So that's for the BLA.</p>
<p class="p p5">If you look at the EUA, so first, it's important for people to know that there has not been EUA for vaccines before. So this is a part of legislation that exists for EUA that has been used on the therapeutic side a number of times, that’s not been used in vaccines. Now, Dr. Marks, who runs CBER, has commented last week that it would be more of an EUA plus in terms of standards. And our understanding of that comment is that, they do not intend to lower the bar on efficacy for the EUA.</p>
<p class="p p5">So what we expect is sponsors will have to show an efficacy of at least 50% to be able to get an EUA. And EUA will not be accepted if it was based on neutralizing antibodies, because, as we all know, there is no yet, given the exception the virus correlate protection. And the agency has been very, very clear about it, in public meetings and comments and guidelines as well as in private discussions.</p>
<p class="p p5">So what we've understanded the EUA plus being is, it's an EUA in a sense that you might get very quick approval for emergency use in a smaller population. Our understanding is, you will be -- it could be -- sorry, I want to be careful, because I'm not FDA, it could be healthcare worker. And it could be the elderly. What is not clear is where we'll be the age cut-off. Is it only 75, 70, 65? And by this mechanism, it will give the FDA, I think, a very nice position of a risk-reward where you give access to a vaccine that you believe has a 50% efficacy, that's the EUA plus. And you don't give access to all the U.S. population, so you can still continue to monitor safety.</p>
<p class="p p5">Because if you think about the time line, I mean, we've said in November, there's another mRNA company that has said October, repeatedly. With both studies having started on, July 27, that's not a lot of months of safety dataset. And so, what we understand is that the EUA or EUA plus would be 50% efficacy will be whatever safety is available at that time and by doing a small population that is manageable at very high risk, it gives FDA the possibility to give access to a much-needed product. And to monitor very tightly that small population, before, I would assume, a few months after, when there is enough or a bit more safety, launches seasonal data across the study, across people that have access on the EUA to then get a full BLA.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay, perfect. I want to make sure we have time for some non-COVID topics, but I guess two more things on COVID that come up a lot. Manufacturing, maybe just give us an update there. How many doses have you produced so far? And where do you think you'll be by the end of the year? And I guess the last part to that is what gets you from that 500 million run rate to the 1 billion run rate?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. So, let me start by the big picture and then I'll work with the detail. So, we confirm that our base plan, we know how to make 500 million doses next year. The team is very comfortable that they have a good line of sight to that. While the team is working very hard is how do we get to 1 billion dose and they are making very good progress. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">If you think about the four bottlenecks that exist to get to that outcome is, you need GMP space and this could longer -- we have enough GMP space for a billion doses. That's not an issue. You need capital equipment to make the product and this between what we have already received and validated and what is literally in flight coming soon and with recent confirmation by suppliers that they are on time and on track to deliver that.</p>
<p class="p p6">We think on the CapEx front, we will have manufacturing capacity to deliver 1 billion dose. Then you have two more things left that you need to achieve to get to the finish line. One is people, we are very advanced in the recruitment of people. We've had incredible quality and numbers of people that have send us resumes to apply for jobs. So, we also feel very good about our ability to get enough people to deliver 1 billion dose. </p>
<p class="p p6">The last piece is raw materials. So, as I said, we have a good line of sight to 500 million doses. What is not clear yet today is will we get on time all the raw material to get to 1 billion dose. So, of course, as time is going to go by, we would get more and more certainty about getting or not getting and what quantity we're going to get.</p>
<p class="p p6">So, I think what we should anticipate Matthew is as time goes by in the next few months, we will update that number. I expect it to be updated on the way up. It's very hard to say, are we going to get to 800 million doses or 100 odd billion for fiscal year 2021. But the team is doing a very nice job and I'm cautiously optimistic that we will be north of 500 million, but 500 million, I think is another people can use and put in the back in terms of what we can deliver. </p>
<p class="p p6">In 2020, we have not communicated publicly a precise number because the ramp is like this, and the team are still doing a lot of work. But it's going to be in the millions of doses, it's not going to be 50 million doses, it's going to be neither 500,000 doses. It will be in many millions of doses. And the team is working really hard to push that number as much as we can.</p>
<p class="p p6">Again, as always, it's a bit like on a clinical front, which studies, we don't want to cut corners, where it's the same thing as you do manufacturing. Quality is critical. We do not want to cut corners. We have to make sure we ship high-quality products that meet the highest spec of quality, and of course, FDA standards.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And then distribution, you've obviously commented on your cold chain requirements. Can you just put that in context with what exists from the distribution network out there and how you're thinking about distribution?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. So, unlike COVE [ph], many vaccines that have to be stored at minus 17, we are at minus 20. And the reason we did that technology change, which required a lot of investment around many years is that the distribution channels do have minus 20 capabilities. </p>
<p class="p p6">If you look to all the big distributors and wholesalers in the developed world and even in the developing world, they have minus 23, those are available. And so that is why we made the move.</p>
<p class="p p6">If you look at the Moderna portfolio, all the other vaccines are lyophilize at 2 to 5 celsius storage condition. The reason we decided early on, and I'm sure it is the same reason over mRNA manufacturer first to go liquid and not lyo is to maximize output. Lyo will have a two problem with a pandemic is one, you have a mass loss when you lyophilize a product, because no process is 100% yield, of course. And given that we knew the industry was going to be with a supply constraint in the first 12 to 18 months post-launch.</p>
<p class="p p6">I think we all decided independently that to maximize the number of vials we could make, we could not go lyo, because we will lose too much mass of vaccine as you do the manufacturing process.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">And the second reason is there is not $1 billion or $2 billion or $5 billion of lyo capacity sitting idle in the world, because lyo is very expensive. And so there was just a very practical access to supply. While we are confident we could file, especially we have a 10 dose per vial.</p>
<p class="p p7">So if we make $500 million, we only need to fill 50 million vials. And so it was clear to us based on mapping of the industry that we had a good line of sight on how to get that. And as you know, we've signed deals with Catalent and with Rovi. So we know how to make that happen for filing.</p>
<p class="p p7">Lyo has been a big issue. But thanks to the investment in science we made over years. We are able to deliver that at minus 20, which is a temperature that already has commercial product and freezer available into warehouses and distributors. That's not an issue.</p>
<p class="p p7">The other thing about distribution, which I think will be a big benefit to the Moderna product, Matthew, is the fact that we do not require on-site dilution. Some of our products require dilution on-site that increased very risk of quality, because if people make a mistake diluting, and it also makes it more complicated, because it – you cannot do that in any setting, a special kind of quality control setting in terms of nurse or doctors to do that and we don't need that.</p>
<p class="p p7">In the Moderna product, we literally get the vial out of a 2 to 5 degrees because the last days can be a 2 to 5. So you can have a fridge, you put a syringe in a vial, you pull up one dose. You clean the arm, you inject it to put a mandate, you don't -- we don't need any device like some of our vaccine need. We don't need any dilution on-site. It's very straight forward. It's liquid. You don't need to reconstitute like lyo or whatever. So we think and we spend a lot of time with the team as we are designing the product, making all those decisions. So it could be really used for pandemic setting.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, perfect. I guess last quickly, stability, how do you think about the need for -- how much stability you need for an EUA versus the BLA?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So it will be initially in months and not in years, because you won't have real-time data in years. And what will happen, which is very typical to do some products that got accelerated into development like sometime oncology product, is in the EUA label, you'll get whatever you have, and it might be three months, four months, five months. And then you will expand that label as you can show the data to the regulators.</p>
<p class="p p7">Again, very typical to other products. I don't think there's going to be any issue, because the world is so waiting for vaccines that we're going to be hand to mark from manufacturers to hospitals for a long time. So if we as an industry launch, with three or four months or five months stability data, it is not an issue. It is in my opinion time.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay. Perfect. So maybe in the last six or seven minutes here, we can touch on some non-COVID topics. So CMV data, I guess, still on track for 3Q for that data. And then maybe because everybody has been so focused on COVID, remind us what we're going to get and what that means relative to your Phase 3 trial in CMV?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Great. Well, thank you for asking a non-COVID question because, I get a lot of this. So indeed, we have a very big portfolio at Moderna. I got 23 development candidates. The next big one in the vaccine world is CMV, cytomegalovirus. That is a virus that is the number one cause of birth defect in the U.S. and around the developed world. 10,000 kids in the U.S. just this year will be born with birth defect or will die. No vaccine on the market. The industry has been for 20 years trying to make a vaccine. And what the industry could not do is do the right antigen.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">The Moderna vaccine has six different mRNA in each virus, and we saw very exciting Phase 1 data. The Phase 2 data indeed is consumed for Q3. And given we are September 14, it means, it's going to come up very quickly, I'll confirm the Q3 date. And what you're going to see is going to see a much bigger data set in terms of the number of participants in the study, neutralizing antibodies on GB antigen and pathogen antigen like we saw in our Phase 1 safety.</p>
<p class="p p8">The dose range, as you remember, Matthew, is tighter than what it was in the Phase 1. Again, we had never done the six mRNA product in the clinic before, so we wanted a big brands, because we don't understand really much how much antigen were going to get expressed in the safety profile. Based on that exciting but early Phase 1 data, we basically narrowed the dose for the Phase 2.</p>
<p class="p p8">So, I think what we want to get is a bigger end and also a sense for what will be the dose for our Phase 3. The Phase 3 is totally on track to start in 2021. We have already a Type C meeting with the FDA on CMC. So the manufacturing questions we had have all been answered by the FDA, which is great for CMV, but of course was very helpful also for the COVID-19 1273.</p>
<p class="p p8">And so what we need once solve data is cleaned up and finalized is an end of Phase 2 meeting with the agency to finalize the Phase 3. We already had a question with the FDA around endpoint, as we shared before, size of Phase 3 and so on. So, we think, it's more of kind of -- we group with the agency and whole hand before we start the Phase 3. But in our opinion, everything is nicely on track to start the CMV Phase 3 in 2021.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay, good. And I guess, remind people, market opportunity for CMV and competitive risk there?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yeah. So, CMV, we believe, is a $2 billion to $5 billion annual peak sales product. We believe the first indication will be in adults and the target product profile is going to be women in the age of bearing a child before pregnancy. So, we see that as being a GP and OBGYN product that a woman will get vaccinated when she does a regular visit to the GP or OBGYN depending on habit. It is not intended for pregnant women.</p>
<p class="p p8">And then, what we want to do is to run a study in the teenager setting because. we believe it will be a great product to be vaccinated at the same time as the HPV GarDasil vaccine is vaccinated into teenager. So, literally you could envision one arm, you get HPV on the other arm, the same day you get the CMV vaccine. And then, our goal is to go down in age because CMV is only transmitted by humans. And so like Kubera [ph], if you were to get into the newborn, we should be able to eradicate CMV, which would be fantastic public health victory.</p>
<p class="p p8">We talk about birth defects. There's also more and more data being reported at CMV has a long-term impact on somebody's quality of life once infected by CMV, you are infected for life, a bit like Hepatitis or HPV. And there is more and more data coming, there is no concession demonstrated yet. But more and more data coming that actually people set up CMV a long time higher rate of cancers and other disease. So that's why we think, if we could vaccinate everybody against CMV, women, men and then adolescent and then toddlers that will be a great thing for public health.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay. Perfect. And then maybe in the last couple of minutes, some of the rare disease programs, obviously, they have been impacted by COVID in terms of being able to enroll them. Just any updates on where patients are and your ability to generate data there and how you're thinking about when we might see something out of them?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So Matthew given this is not a broad public meeting. It's hard for me to give updates compared to what we shared at the quarterly call, in our quarterly call we were saying that, we were in the process of kind of restarting sites and reengaging sites across the board with children, hMPV/PIV in vaccine or so the rare disease.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9">We have an R&amp;D Day coming up on Thursday, like year after the Morgan Stanley conference. And we will be very happy to give an update on the rare disease as well as the oncology program because we have a five program in oncology in the clinic. So we'll give a full update on those two on Thursday to make sure that don't by mistake bridge break FDA today.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Okay. Okay. So maybe then last question, I think you extended your partnership with Vertex obviously getting mRNA into the lung is an interesting problem. Maybe remind people when might you think you'll have something ready to put into the clinic there? And what's sort of the opportunity you're targeting?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Stéphane Bancel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. So thank you so much. So indeed, we are very pleased that Vertex wise decided to expand the collaboration to deliver mRNA via IRO starting to relent to express a full CFTR protein. The goal of Vertex, I think, is definitely to go after as it's well documented and talked about by the Vertex management. To go after those kids that do not respond to Vertex drugs because of genetic mutations, we've shared some exciting progress at our Science Day back in the spring. We have not forward guided with Vertex of the when, we will going to the clinic with this program.</p>
<p class="p p9">But I think, if the momentum continues and the teams are doing very good, we should, in the next two quarters be able to declare a candidate -- take the candidate into the clinic. And if that works, it will provide with Moderna -- the ability to get into the lung as a new modality, as a new space. And Vertex has only right to the CFTR gene. So everything else in cancer, in the pulmonary disease, in infectious disease, will be 100% owned to Moderna with no royalties back into Vertex. So we are very excited by that.</p>
<p class="p p9">And as you know, we're also working, as we showed in our Science Day two years ago, on getting into the blood through mRNA to go potentially into immune disease and so on. So there's a lot of things cooking and we are very excited about the company prospects.</p>
<p class="p p9">I think COVID is kind of the first product that has a chance to get approved and to show that mRNA can be, and you may have seen, if this happens, which would be very de-risking to the entire platform, because all of our products use the same chemistry. Of course, formulation varies by application, which is also why the COVID vaccine gets approved, I think you will be very powerful with across and increase the priority of success of all our vaccines.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Matthew Harrison</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Great. Stéphane, thanks for being here. Thanks for the thoughtful answers.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Stéphane Bancel</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Thank you, Matthew for the invite and stay well. Speak to you soon at latest, Thursday actual. Thanks. Bye-bye.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Matthew Harrison</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Bye.</p></div>
