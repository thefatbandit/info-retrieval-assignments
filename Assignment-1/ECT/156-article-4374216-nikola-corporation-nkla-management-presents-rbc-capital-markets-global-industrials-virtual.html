<p class="p p1">Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Joseph Spak</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good afternoon everyone. I am Joseph Spak, the lead Auto Analyst here at RBC Capital Markets and this morning very pleased to be joined by Nikola, a company that’s trying to change zero-emission transportation and infrastructure. We're very pleased to have with us today CFO, Kim Brady. The format for today's call is fireside chat. Hope we have a number of questions, but I highly encourage investors online to get involved in the conversation. To submit the question, there should be a Q&amp;A box on the webcast window. Please ask those questions and we will ask them anonymously and integrate them into conversation.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, with that Kim, welcome. Thanks for joining us today.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Joseph Spak</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">And the first question is obviously to address the elephant in the room, the company has been in the crosshairs last week with the short-sellers retention, you put out a response to some of the allegation this morning. Maybe you could let us know your view of some of the response and really also maybe where the company is today versus maybe some of the things pointed out in the report three or four years ago?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Kim Brady</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Look, I think, the response speaks for itself, I think is comprehensive and hopefully this will be helpful to investors as we think about what we have in front of us, significant difference. As you know, many of the allegations on the report was related to pre-Nikola. We are very much focused on moving forward and focused on delivery Nikola Tre, Nikola Two as well the Roughage Truck as well as the Badger.</p>
<p class="p p1">When you think about our world-class partners who have been in with us from the beginning, as well as early-stage investors, if you think about barge [ph] for Series B as well as Series C, they have been partners for the last four or five years, and they understand exactly where we are and we have been to develop some great systems with them and we feel very confident that we'll be able to deliver vehicles on the target days that we have articulated.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Joseph Spak</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Okay. Maybe for some investors in the audience who aren't as familiar with Nikola or maybe made aware of Nikola by some of the media reports last week. Can you walk us through how you view your unique business model allows Nikola to address both short-haul and long-haul commercial vehicle use cases?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Kim Brady</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Sure. And that's a great question. Nikola Tre is a short-haul application. We will sell the truck outright to customers. Nikola Two is actually for medium-haul and long-haul applications. And we have a bundled pricing model for Nikola Two.</p>
<p class="p p1">What that means is that it's a fixed lease over seven years, whichever comes first. And it includes truck, repair and maintenance, as well as fuel. The reason why we are doing that is to address both chicken and the egg problem. And the only way we can advance the hydrogen ecosystem is to ensure in the short-term over the next several years that we are able to control how we actually roll-out fueling network, and we can only do that to the extent that we can actually control truck, repair and maintenance, as well as fuel.</p>
<p class="p p1">When you think about Nikola Tre and for short-haul, it's important to understand that this is a pretty crowded market, essentially approximately 15% of the classic truck segment is short-haul. But the benefit of the short-haul is for trucks that come back to base each night, so this is great for in a city operation, last mile distribution. And what's important, is that, you have confidence that you have no range anxiety. So if you think about short-haul, essentially, what we have is a highly differentiated product.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Nikola Tre is 720 kilowatt hour battery pack. What that means is that, it's going to address the high end of the short-haul range. It's a calibrated for European model for better visibility, has a shorter wheelbase for tighter turning radius. So it's a very attractive differentiated product, we think, it will resonate very well with potential customers.</p>
<p class="p p2">For medium haul and long-haul it's important to recognize that you can't get there with battery only, because of the cost, because of the weight, because of charging issues and ultimately you are compromising the hauling capacity of your customer. So we know that it's much better to address it with fuel cell truck.</p>
<p class="p p2">When we think about FCV, we are really targeting what we call dedicated route customers. These are customers that are making a fixed point-to-point route runs. So, essentially, there are about, 1.8 million Class 8 trucks on the road, approximately 15% to 20% representing what we call dedicated to corporate customers. And they're focused on making daily distribution.</p>
<p class="p p2">So essentially, one point to the next point and it's a fixed route, making multiple milk runs every single day. And those are the ideal customers that we're focused on for the next 10 years, because we know, that with point-to-point dedicated route customers, we know the routes, we know number of trucks that they have deployed, we know number of milk runs that they make.</p>
<p class="p p2">And that's really important, why don't we think about addressing both chicken and the egg problem. As you know, when it comes to fuel cell, it's not simply about truck. It's also about fuelling, any customers that are looking to address their medium haul and long-haul, they are willing to do that with a fuel cell truck.</p>
<p class="p p2">However, they are highly interested in how we’re going to fuel, by having a dedicated route we can focus on those routes and build that hydrogen station, one station at a time so that we don't speculate and able to achieve enough density over time, so that 10 years down the road, then we can focus on remaining 80% of the market segment, which would be 3PL customers. But it's important, in terms of their progression, how we can actually develop and address both chicken and the egg solution. And we believe the only way we can do that, is when we are able to control both truck, as well as fuel and repair and maintenance.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Joseph Spak</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. And you touched on a lot of good points there, Kim and I want to dive into some of those. Maybe, just to start and to address one of the most popular inbound questions we've gotten from investors over the past couple days, which is, what does Nikola actually do? What is the proprietary technology?</p>
<p class="p p2">And I find is kind of interesting, because your, initial Class 8 truck, as you just mentioned, is always built with IVECO and Bosch initially on some of the fuel cells, right? And then, as relates to the Badger pickup, it was always announced that that would be built with the department as well. So it seems to me like there's maybe a little bit of a misunderstanding here of the business model opportunity, which I think what you're trying to communicate is really being able to capitalize on the concept of a hydrogen fuel cell truck, which is unique and differentiated. But, I'd like to hear how you describe, how the Nikola is proprietary and what it is about Nikola, actual allowances in marketplace?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Kim Brady</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">That's a great question, because I do think there's confusion in the marketplace. As a new startup, it's important that we capitalize our relationship with world-class partners that we have put together. The reason why we have them is to accelerate going to market, as well as to leverage technology, while we are working with them.</p>
<p class="p p2">What we are great at is in terms of design and innovation. Our partners bring decades of experience in terms of component manufacturing. When we actually marry those two capabilities, we can move much quicker. We have our own proprietary technologies, as well as we also leverage our partners. Partners know that, and we have always welcomed opportunity to work together with potential partners.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">The reason why we have been able to be so successful, because our DNA is to work with world-class partners, and think about that, you can do it alone, or you're talking about massive investments in terms of personnel, as well as CapEx, and as a startup it’s difficult to do that, and not only that you're going to have a very long lead time if you try to do it on your own. So, what we do is that we leverage our expertise, and then we marry up with partner, who can actually deliver their expertise, and this has been worked very well for Nicola.</p>
<p class="p p3">Let me give you an illustration. For Iveco partnership, as you know, Iveco, CNHI Iveco was our lead investor for Series D round, and they set evaluation and they agreed to invest $250 million, $100 million in cash and $150 million in-kind services. With that in-kind services we were able to leverage Iveco’s S-way, which was the latest homologated classic truck introduced in July of 2019.</p>
<p class="p p3">The benefits are huge. To give you an example, as you know, truck has thousands of components, but not all those components are important. So Iveco, we had access to the Iveco’s intellectual property with reflected their S-way, not only that had -- we have access to their validated parts been.</p>
<p class="p p3">So for example, for Nikola Tre, almost 85% to 90% of the components that represent 15% of value, come from Iveco, and that's a wonderful thing, because we don't have to actually validate those components ourselves, not only that set up a supply chain. We are leveraging Iveco supply chain, their costs.</p>
<p class="p p3">But when it comes to most important components, essentially, 15% of components that represent 90% of value, so essentially we're taking Iveco S-way, stripping out powertrain, and then we’re electrifying it. So Nikola is response for the battery, e-axle, e-motors, inverters, BMS system, infotainment system, vehicle control units.</p>
<p class="p p3">These are all vertical components for next-generation Class 8 truck. And that's what we're good at. And so this is a wonderful partnership, and this is an example of how we utilize and leverage our partnership relationship. This is for Nikola Tre, which actually is being built right now, and five prototypes will be done by end of September, and it's being built at-home facilities.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Joseph Spak</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Thank you for that color. So, Kim, maybe to sort of address the other point of the question and if we want to talk here over the long-term business plan and laid out in the go public process, it does seem like a bigger opportunities on the field so leasing size so – and understand that electric trucks, make sense for certain applications. But I guess the question is, why distract yourself with a Badger product or some of the power sports stuff you’ve played out there. Do you think there's sort of too much to chew on right off the back?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Kim Brady</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">That's a fair question. And we ask ourselves that all the time. As you know, especially as a startup, what's really important is execution. There's limited resources, limited personnel. So it's important that we are very much focused in terms of our execution. And it's not simply about what can we do, but what should we do? And so, that's something that we are asking all the time.</p>
<p class="p p3">So as you think about the Badger which is a B2C consumer product -- pick-up truck, we knew that, if we were to build that ourselves you would actually distract from our primary business focus, which is B2B, and Class 8 trucks, as well as building a network of hydrogen stations. And so that's the reason why we have always stated that, we would not go to market for the Badger unless we found a world-class manufacturing partner, and we have been able to do that with GM.</p>
<p class="p p3">So we recognize that our core business is B2B Class 8 trucks. We have three products for battery products. We have Nikola Tre BEV and Nikola ET One, which is the electric truck that will deliver to Republic Services for medium-haul and long-haul, we have Nikola Two, which is a fuel cell truck. And then ultimately, we will be building out a network of stations to accommodate customers for our fuel cell truck.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Joseph Spak</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. With respect to and actually you know -- which you know I notice, how should we think about the margin profile for selling that vehicle? I know the agreement said, they sell it to you it cost plus. But you’re seeing, like you know whether it’s a cost of goods, but we get to see, some of the other development cost obviously. We've seen other startup the consumer EVs claim that they can get gross margin net of 25% to 30% interest.</p>
<p class="p p4">Do you think that's -- that's applicable for Badger and of the 4 billion in savings that you've mentioned with that, can you just clarify is that in relation to what it would have cost you to start that program on itself or versus your initial planning is just correct me, if I'm wrong, but I don't think Badger since the initial financials you laid out can be more robust?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Kim Brady</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">You're right that in our financials that we have laid out. We have nothing in there for the Badger. And that was purposely done, because we were so working on a potential relationship with OEMs. We will -- in the future, a layout, in terms of the Badger volume pricing cost. And what you should expect for cat-backs. But if you think about this relationship, it should be in a much broader terms, this is not simply about manufacturing – contract manufacturing.</p>
<p class="p p4">When an EV company have to introduce a new platform for a pickup truck, you will run probably anywhere from $3 billion to $4 billion which you think about all the engineering validation testing, homologation, plus CapEx. This project likely will take about four years. So, you should think about our partnership with GM, where we are able to leverage GM’s manufacturing expertise and the cost of that as we talked about will be $3 billion to $4 billion. If you think about our relationship with GM, we are issuing $2 billion of stocks. And then, we will also be committing to approximately $700 million in CapEx.</p>
<p class="p p4">So ultimately, we are able to reduce our CapEx costs, because if we have to build a separate plant for a passenger vehicle likely will run around $1 billion and then when it comes to engineering cost, the fact that we can rely on GM’s engineer using their existing template and architecture, we can accelerate introduction to market, and that was really important for us.</p>
<p class="p p4">Then, on the implication on the commercial truck side for Nikola Tre, if we actually take existing volume that we have forecasted for the next 10 years, we have assumed certain costs for battery and based on our agreement with GM, we will have access to their OTM battery technology. And they -- that's a JV between GM and LG Chem, and they have represented certain cost targets that they will be able to deliver.</p>
<p class="p p4">If we are able to achieve that, we believe, just the battery savings for Nikola Tre will be approximately $4 billion over 10 years. So, what that means is that using our battery cells that we purchased from third party and including our module and pack design and we know that there will be cost savings over the next two, three, four years. However, what we have assumed in our model is higher than what we believe GM will be able to deliver, and so we have to look at GM-Nikola partnership really in totality in terms of overall opportunity that we have by entering into that relationship. We know, it's a win-win because GM is able to identify potential savings on their end. And we are also able to identify potential savings on our end.</p>
<p class="p p4">When it comes to their CapEx, they're able to allocate portion of their plan to us, which will result in full utilization of the plan, but not only their savings in terms of their CapEx, and we are able to reduce our CapEx if we were to actually build our own plan for the Badger by leveraging GM's existing platform at the plant. So, we think this is a very, very good win-win partnership.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Joseph Spak</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yeah, thanks for that color. I guess, it is included in some of the savings. Is that also -- is there also an assumption that you will use a GM fuel cell for the commercial vehicles in the North America theater?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Kim Brady</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. And we have been very transparent that the fuel cell system that we have co-developed with Bosch that Bosch has the utilization right. And the -- we have been working with Bosch and the reason why it's important that Bosch was able to commercialize this is that Bosch is looking to own next generation powertrain is a very important key strategic initiative for the company. And what we have agreed with Bosch is with respect to meeting certain efficiency, reliability and uptime, as well as warranty.</p>
<p class="p p5">Now, we have actually two world class suppliers, Bosch for Europe, and then GM for North America, we think this will only make Nikola stronger, because now we have two suppliers that are world-class that have some of the best fuel cell systems.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Joseph Spak</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. Post-GM announcement, it did get me thinking a little bit because for the Nikola Tre, right now you're using the Iveco to start; for the Badger, you're having GM help out in Charger manufacturer those vehicles. And I know Iveco I think is helping you set up or stand up the Coolidge, Arizona factory as well. But can you just walk us through the rationale as to why you think you need to build that vehicle in the U.S. or is there an opportunity to contract manufacturing the truck here as well?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Kim Brady</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">You know, as you know, our commercial trucks, is our core business. And if you think about the market size, it's about the same in the U.S. as well as in Europe. In Europe, we want to make sure that originally in terms of our sequencing, the U.S. was going to be our primary focus and Europe the second. However, with the Iveco partnership, we are able to accelerate our joint venture manufacturing. That's what we have in Europe with Iveco.</p>
<p class="p p5">As you know, we have a facility that's being repurposed, as well as being refurbished at Iveco campus and there is a building that's being refurbished now, it will be substantially complete by 2020. And then by May 2021, the facility will be ready for manufacturing. And so for six months or so, we will likely manufacture trucks in Iveco campus and then export that to the U.S. for 2021 volume. This is purely a bridge solution.</p>
<p class="p p5">In the U.S., we have a Greenfield manufacturing facility. We think that's actually important and key to ensure that we have manufacturing available for Nikola Tre as well as Nikola 2. The plant will be up in running by end of 2021 for Phase 1. We have broken ground in July, and Phase 1 is for low volume manufacturing, it will cost approximately $125 million. And we believe that it will be completed by beginning of Q4 of 2021. And so we'll be able to manufacturer BEV trucks in 2022 from our Greenfield manufacturing facility.</p>
<p class="p p5">Phase 2 manufacturing will be in around early 2022 and it will be completed by mid-2023. Phase 2 will likely cause approximately $500 million, if you include the paint line. Once Phase 2 is completed, mid-2023, our capacity will increase to approximately 35,000 units per year running two shifts manufacturing both BEV trucks, as well as fuel cell trucks.</p>
<p class="p p5">Ultimately, we can run three shifts and increase the capacity to about 50,000 units. Just so that you are aware, as you know, we recruited some of our best manufacturing talent. Our Head of Global Manufacturing comes from Toyota; he was there for 20 years. And then he was the Head of Manufacturing at Tesla. And then last few years, he spent three years in China, building a Greenfield manufacturing facility for Biden and so we think we got the right talent. We are moving aggressively. And we feel confident that we can deliver our timeline with respect to manufacturing facility.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Joseph Spak</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Maybe, as we sort of approach the end of the session here. Just focused on what I think is one of the sort of the crucial elements of the Nikola which is this concept of two maps, right. One being, where are these dedicated routes, where I think you said 25% of trucks are used for dedicated routes today.</p>
<p class="p p6">And the second being, where you can get cheap electricity in order to produce hydrogen at the levels you said you can. So, the overlap of those two maps is to me, it seems like where you're opportunity is, and I really wanted to focus on, as we sort of closely adjust the electricity map, whether it's $0.035 cost of electricity or its for hydrogen at $3 per kilogram, what gives you confidence that you'll be able to achieve that rate on quarterly basis? And what are some of the methods and ways that Nikola thinks they can procure electricity that inexpensive?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Kim Brady</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Great question. When it comes to operating stations, the number one variable that represents about 80% to 85% of the cost is related to electricity cost. And we believe that we can achieve a target rate of around $0.035 per kilowatt hour, that's including transmission and distribution. And this is important because if we can achieve that, we believe we can achieve a generating hydrogen onsite for approximately, let's say, around 2.85, 2.90 including depreciation and amortization, assuming CapEx can be achieved at around $16 million, $17 million.</p>
<p class="p p6">We feel very confident over the next three or four years on the CapEx side, electrolyzer costs will be dropping 30% to 40%. If you talk to anyone in this space, as capacity is increasing we know we feel confident that cost can be achieved. We believe that's already happening, likely in China, because their hydrogen ecosystem is much more advanced than in the Western world.</p>
<p class="p p6">When it comes to electricity price, there's couple of things that we need to understand. Number one, if you think about renewable PPAs, there are several example of renewable PPAs that have been executed early part of this year, all solar running anywhere from $0.08 [ph] per kilowatt hour to about $0.023 per kilowatt hour. When it comes to wind, especially in the Midwest, you are able to enter into a long-term PPA anywhere from 15 to 25 years for below $0.02 per kilowatt hour. And so, we know for certain in the current environment, you can actually enter into renewables at $0.02.</p>
<p class="p p6">Now, when it comes to when we have conversations with utilities as well as system operators, the value that we bring are three things. One, because the amount of power that you need for each station is substantial, approximately 19 megawatts to 20 megawatts of power. And the fact that we generate hydrogen, at least 21 hours a day, and as you know these electrolyzers are designed to run 23 hours, 23 to 24 hours a day.</p>
<p class="p p6">What that means is that we have constant load. This is really beneficial for utilities. So what we do is that about half the time we're generating power overnight. What that means is that when we take power overnight, those rates are about half the rates of day rates. And so, essentially we are helping utilities generate incremental revenue. Right now they have excess capacity. And they have very little demand doing overnight. And so they're happy to provide power overnight.</p>
<p class="p p6">Number two, we can help balance the grid. The reason is that during daytime at the peak of power generation, there's not enough to demand. So you got an excess supply. During noon, we take power, because we have constant load. And then, during 4 o'clock to 7 o'clock when there's peak demand, but not enough supply, we can actually curtail power.</p>
<p class="p p6">So what we do is that we are willing to take interruptible power, we help balance the grid, and we help utilities to share rental revenue. That's the reason why, why don't we actually have discussions with utilities. We are not looking for simply best retail rates or industrial rates, we're looking for best wholesale rates, and when we have this discussion to understand that we bring significant value.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">For example, in terms of current discussions that we're having for a station that will go up in Phoenix, and the city pair will be in Southern California. The conversations that we're having with local utilities, essentially approximately $0.03 per kilowatt hour delivered. And so we know that those solutions are available. We recognized that we're not going to have onsite hydrogen generation, at every location.</p>
<p class="p p7">But if you think about the best way to advance hydrogen economy is by actually focusing on dedicated routes because ultimately you want to focus on customers first, and make sure that you lock in their demand, so that there's high utilization, and then you start developing stations, one station at a time, so it's not a speculation.</p>
<p class="p p7">We believe, by doing that over the next five to six years. We will likely have a network, it's a stealth network of around 75 stations. And then over time, we are going to fill in the network, such that after 10, 12, 13 years you have enough density network that you can focus on the remaining percentage of the market. And so that's really our strategy and we feel confident that we can deliver that.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Joseph Spak</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Great. So final question as we end the session here. You talked about the importance of building these strategic partners, how the conversations over the past couple of days are just that’s a biggest [indiscernible] do you think they've been supportive or do you see sort of any risks or this large [ph] industry needs to go on with consumer partnerships?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Kim Brady</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Look they're offended. The fact that you have a short seller population to support essentially pointing out that they're being hoodwinked, that's ridiculous. I can tell you that, Bosch is incredibly thoughtful, when they invested in us for Series B and C route. I can tell you that they had a number of engineers involved in their due diligence over several months, when CNHI made investment in Nikola. I can tell you that some of their advisors. They had Goldman Sachs for financial valuation. For business strategy, they had McKinsey. For accounting due diligence, they had Deloitte. And for legal, they had Solverent Farm Law [ph].</p>
<p class="p p7">I think it's offensive to our strategic partners that you have a short seller who's doing a hack job, and essentially point fingers at our strategic partners that they don't know what they're doing. I would suggest that it's ridiculous to think that, that they haven't done a deep dive, much more deep dive than what any third party short seller would have been able to perform.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Joseph Spak</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Great. Kim, I really appreciate you taking the time today, and respond to some of the questions you've been getting from industry. So thank you very much for your time and thanks all -- for joining us today. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Kim Brady</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thank you, Joe.</p></div>
