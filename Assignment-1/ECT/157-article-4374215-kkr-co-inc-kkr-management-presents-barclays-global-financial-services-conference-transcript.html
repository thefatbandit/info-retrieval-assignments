<p class="p p1">Jeremy Campbell - Barclays </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Jeremy Campbell</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">All right. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Jeremy Campbell, and I cover the Exchanges, Brokers and Asset Managers sector here at Barclays. Kicking off our slate of alternative asset managers that we cover is Rob Lewin, KKR's CFO. Rob, very happy to have you here at our now virtual Global Financial Services Conference. I don't -- I wish we could be doing this in person but happy to have you here nonetheless.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Rob Lewin</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Thanks a lot for including KKR and me in your conference and look forward to the discussion.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Jeremy Campbell</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. So, I just -- why don't we start off with the topic that's on a lot of people's minds here is the Global Atlantic. You guys announced your planned acquisition earlier this year. Guidance around the deal seems pretty positive to the tune of about $200 million in incremental fee-related revenue at a pretty high incremental margin. So, I guess, first, just at a high level, why did it make sense for KKR to enter the insurance business today? And I guess, what drew you guys to Global Atlantic in particular?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes, great. Well, it's a good first question to get started with. Like any acquisition we're going to do, I think we're going to be focused on three things, and that's going to be the industry that we're investing into, the business model, and the management team that we're backing, and then how we can mutually make each other better than we can do on our own and so let's take each one of those in order.</p>
<p class="p p1">The first is the industry. Insurance has been a big target market for us for a long period of time. We have roughly $30 billion of assets under management exposed to insurance companies today. The total addressable market, as you know, is just massive. It's about $30 trillion of investable assets.</p>
<p class="p p1">Now, clearly, only a small subset of that $30 trillion is applicable to the products that KKR has available today. But we see, in a low rate environment, the likelihood for a greater share of alternatives being part of the investable asset universe for insurance. So, just a really massive overall market for us to be able to penetrate.</p>
<p class="p p1">The second and clearly the most exciting from our perspective is the business and the management team. It's a management team that started at Global Atlantic roughly 15 years ago from scratch. Super high-quality team, we think best-in-class and we couldn't be more excited to invest behind their creativity and their forward-leaning approach to how they've built out their business.</p>
<p class="p p1">In terms of the Global Atlantic franchise itself, the one thing that's really attracted us to the business is their differentiated distribution capability, and they've got really entrenched positions today in the bank and broker-dealer, a channel that we see real secular growth from -- on a go-forward basis and we think is pretty defensible from a barrier to entry perspective as well.</p>
<p class="p p1">And then finally, how can we make each other better in our respective businesses? And I think the Global Atlantic team would say they were attracted to a partner like KKR and our ability to help them source and originate differentiated assets that could increase their net investment margin and ultimately their ROE to their shareholders.</p>
<p class="p p1">And then from our perspective, we've been pretty clear on the financial benefits of this transaction, which we think are substantial to KKR. It takes our AUM from a little over $220 billion to close to $300 billion on a pro forma basis. The investing assets that we manage on behalf of insurance companies go up roughly three and a half times from $30 billion to around $100 billion.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">And maybe the most significant stat would be that our perpetual assets that we manage on behalf of our clients go from roughly $70 billion to close to $95 billion, so north of four times increase and something that's been a real strategic initiative for us.</p>
<p class="p p2">And then finally, I think you get two high-quality management teams together and undoubtedly, they'll figure out ways to make each other better and we've already seen that dialogue start to take place with the Global Atlantic team and the sharing of ideas across both of our businesses have already led to, I think, things where we can work on together.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Got it. And then I guess once you close the deal, how do you guys think about the growth algorithm in the insurance world between organic and inorganic opportunities?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. So I think it's going to be both. And if you look at Global Atlantic's history, they've really generated nice organic growth in their history as well as some inorganic growth, too. And I think one of the neat things when you look at Global Atlantic, over the last five years, they've roughly doubled the size of their business, their assets have doubled in size. And they've been able to do that without raising additional equity capital.</p>
<p class="p p2">And so when you think about one of KKR's core competencies is it's having access to capital, especially equity capital. And so I do think one of the real opportunities here is it could allow Global Atlantic to be able to look at things that maybe they had trouble in the past looking at on their own with the access to capital that we can bring to bear on situations.</p>
<p class="p p2">But they've done a great job historically growing organically and inorganically. And as we think about the future, we very much think both are opportunities here for us going forward.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Got you. And then I guess, if you kind of look at the fact pattern in the industry these days, it seems like there's upside from using sidecar vehicles, right? And you just talked about your access to capital at KKR and all your different LP networks out there. I kind of wonder if this would be especially important for KKR and Global Atlantic, especially since you're – it's going to be a majority-owned insurance company here.</p>
<p class="p p2">And maybe if you launch something like this, you might not have to use your own capital as part of any inorganic-type transaction on a go-forward basis. Can you just kind of perhaps discuss your appetite for sidecar vehicle or using that third-party capital as part of any kind of future inorganic adds here?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. I think you're spot-on in the question. And of course, one of our competitors has used the sidecar model, I think, very successfully over time. Global Atlantic actually has one meaningful-sized sidecar that they just raised over the last several months. And as we think about the future, that can certainly be an additional area of our tool, our collective toolkit in being able to approach inorganic situations that just allow you to extend your capital and doing so in a vehicle that we think can also deliver interesting or compelling investment returns to the investors who are backing the sidecars. So we do think the sidecar strategy could be a win-win, both for our investors, new investors, Global Atlantic investors, as well as being able to extend the Global Atlantic franchise and be able to compete for some little bit larger-sized transactions.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Got it. And then I guess within the inorganic vein, you talked about bringing two great management teams together and looking at opportunities. Now what do you think like the KKR value prop is in insurance world? Now that we're getting into a, let's call it, relatively crowded field here with most alternative asset managers having some sort of insurance relationship, what do you see as what KKR can kind of bring to the table with Global Atlantic and looking at these inorganic opportunities?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. Sorry, Jeremy, you broke up at the end. You said inorganic opportunities, right?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Correct, correct.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. So I think it's a couple of things. The first, and it always starts with the management team, and we're backing a team that we've got a lot of confidence in can really structure transactions in the right way, who can evaluate risk return in a way that's consistent with how we'd evaluate it.</p>
<p class="p p3">I think you also need to look at the credibility of the team, the trust-based relationship they have within the number of counterparties, and they've been working since founding this business, really creating a number of long-standing trust-based relationships that are really important in a lot of the inorganic types of discussions that you're referring to, particularly blocks or reinsurance transactions.</p>
<p class="p p3">Next, I would say, would be access to capital. It is absolutely a competitive environment to be able to source inorganic transactions in this space. But I do think as you go a little bit more upmarket to larger-sized transactions, there are fewer competitors that could compete at that level.</p>
<p class="p p3">And then I think the third thing, really, is the combination of the Global Atlantic investment team that we've been quite impressed by, as well as our own ability to help them source and originate investment product that could generate additional return. And as you think about driving these inorganic transactions, a big component is how you might be able to reposition the asset side of the equation. And so you combine those three things together, we think we've got quite a compelling opportunity set in front of us and positioning from a marketplace to be able to generate some nice inorganic activity over the coming years.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Got it. Thanks, Rob. And then you, kind of, alluded to this earlier but this really globally low rates regime presents an interesting opportunity. I mean, I guess, how do you guys think about the TAM for insurance acquisitions, either for yourselves or I guess just industry-wide with all these different alt partners?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yeah. I think it's -- the pipeline today around these types of transactions is relatively high. Our expectation is that's likely to continue out into the future, I think, as a number of companies out there are looking at their own balance sheets and figuring ways that they can extend their own capital base, our expectation is there's going to continue to be a fair bit of activity here over the coming years. So for us, it's really a question of how we position ourselves and ensure that we stay disciplined on the transactions that fit best in terms of the areas where we think collectively we can differentiate ourselves.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Great. And then just let's put it all together, right? We talked about organic, we talked about inorganic. Can you just remind us of what your overall growth assumption is here going forward? Are high teens to low 20s insurance asset growth sustainable?</p>
<p class="p p3"> </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yeah. I don't believe we've guided a specific asset growth level. I think we've said two things as it relates to the Global Atlantic acquisition. We see a team and a business model that over time has generated mid-teen types of returns through cycles on an ROE basis. And our expectation is with the right level of investment, that we've got the right team here where we could generate those types of returns through the cycle.</p>
<p class="p p3">And then the second thing we've commented on are our own economics. KKR's asset management economics, by virtue of this combination, where we said by the end of the year one, when you combine our share of Global Atlantic's distributed learnings, we intend to own roughly 60% of Global Atlantic, as well as the management fees that we expect to earn by virtue of being the investment manager at Global Atlantic and, over time, managing specific products directly, we think that adds up to roughly $500 million of after-tax distributable earnings for KKR on a run rate basis at the end of year one.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it. And then, Rob, I think one of the things you guys talked about in that financial guide was perhaps looking for an opportunity to take the fee rate portion of that a little bit higher on the go forward. I know this is subject to all different types of approvals here. But maybe can you just discuss your appetite for kind of requestable higher fee rate, more in line with where some of the industry norms are? And remind us maybe some of like the process involved, like what's the -- is there atypical time line with like a regulatory approval process? What does that look like? And what might some of the pushbacks look like too?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Sure. And so as I hope you understand, we don't want to get out in front of the discussions that we're going to have from a regulatory perspective on this call and those conversations are going. But I would say a couple of things.</p>
<p class="p p4">One, KKR through its asset management business and its capital markets business has regulators all over the world. Our goal is to have a really good relationship and a constructive dialogue with those regulators. Our intention on the insurance side would be to do the exact same thing.</p>
<p class="p p4">I do think some of the things that differentiate KKR's acquisition of Global Atlantic here from an alignment perspective, it is our majority ownership here and we are going to be very much aligned with the overall performance of the insurance business in terms of our own economics.</p>
<p class="p p4">And so, I hope you understand we're not going to get into detail as it relates to specific dialogue on how we see these conversations play out and we want to make sure that we're doing that with the regulators. And once we reach an agreement on what an appropriate arrangement is, we'll, of course, make sure to be transparent with our investors and our analysts around what that economic rate looks like.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. Never a good idea to front-run regulators, I guess, right? And then maybe just one last one here on Global Atlantic, I know on your last earnings call, Scott had kind of reiterated the breadth and the depth of GA's distribution network, I think you alluded to a bit earlier today in our conversation here.</p>
<p class="p p4">Do you see the potential for takeout to kind of leverage these relationships for externalities, either to supplement your own retail products or develop new ones outside of kind of the core GA pipe?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Jeremy, I think that's a really good question. And so to start with, our investment here and partnership with GA is not predicated on that type of convergence. But when you think about GA's product offering when you think about their relationship in the bank and broker-dealer channel, when you look at KKR's product offering and our own set of relationships across those same institutions, we think we're exceptionally well positioned to take advantage of that convergence over time.</p>
<p class="p p4">And so we think it's a huge opportunity. We've already started dialogue on the topic, but it's not something that our transaction here is predicated on and it could take a little bit longer period of time to play out.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got you. And then I guess just speaking of the retail channel. It's been an area where you guys have been putting a lot of effort into for a while now. I mean, can you just elaborate a bit on the steps you've taken so far to give kind of retail investors access to your platform?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Sure. I think there's a couple of different ways that we're trying to invest across our retail platform at KKR. The first is a direct distribution to family offices and high-net-worth clients and providing them access to both our funds and importantly, our co-investments across our various products on a global basis.</p>
<p class="p p4">We have a separate team that is very much focused on the platforms. And so think high-net-worth platforms that sit inside of banks. And that's been an area of real growth for us and we found that our brand has really resonated inside of those channels.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">And the third area is really through partnerships. And certainly, as we look at different distribution globally, there's going to be things where we can find people who do things better than we can do in our own right. And a great example of that is what we've done in the JV we have with FS Investments in the BDC space. That's been a very successful venture for us over the last couple of years as we entered into it.</p>
<p class="p p5">I'd be remiss, as we talked about retail and our own investment, if I didn't also mention, and you probably saw a couple of weeks ago, we announced a new hire to lead our global fundraising effort at KKR. This individual comes with a vast amount of experience across different disciplines on a distribution basis, but does have quite a bit of experience in retail distribution.</p>
<p class="p p5">And so we've made a lot of upfront investments across the three areas, making investments clearly in talent and it started to pay dividends already for us. If you look back in 2015, we managed about $9 billion of retail assets. Today, that's closer to the mid 30s, and we see a lot of opportunity for growth here with continued execution across the investments we have already made.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Got it. And then, I would just naturally think that that's something like real estate or even infrastructure would be a little bit more retail-friendly from a positioning standpoint. You mentioned, obviously, credit inside the BDC as well. But, I guess, what products do retail investors have access to? And is there a way to make some of these channels a little bit more retail-friendly?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. I think you hit on some products that could certainly fit with retail investors. Real estate and credit, of course, are two that have traditionally been fairly large ones. I think the key for us is to make sure that we are linking our product development and our distribution, truly, as one function. And I think it's more important in retail distribution, than it is in any other form of distribution. And so, I think, if we're able to do that, between our brand, our global brand, our multi-decade record of investment performance on behalf of our investors, we think we should have a real opportunity to meaningfully scale what we're doing in the retail universe.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Got it. And then, just, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about what -- obviously, with the DOL and some of these inside 401(k)s, I would assume that this is much more of a potential partnership opportunity with perhaps some more traditional asset managers out there. Have you guys given any thoughts so far as how you might approach that market, if at all?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, sure. Listen, of course, we spent a lot of time already on the topic. What I would say is it is very early days. The opportunity is an immense one for our industry. We say the retail investor, as a whole, has a fairly low, on a relative basis, exposure to alternative investments today. And we're trying to think through the best way that we can make our product offering available to retail investors. And, clearly, the DOL guidance that you referenced could potentially be something that would allow for that in greater scale in the future. But I would say, we're still very much in the early innings. That's how we're going to approach that.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And so, I think, even Scott kind of used the baseload for this, the early innings, right? I think you said a second inning, I think, in the last earnings call. As we look ahead, like what's it going to take for us to get to the second inning stretch, right? What's going on? Is it really further developing like the 401(k) retirement plan? Is it actually going full retail outside of the ultra-high net worth kind of class? What is it going to take from a market perspective to get there?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. Listen, I think it's going to be a lot of execution on a number of the investments that we've already made and probably over the next couple of years, some additional targeted investments that we're going to need to make on top of those that we've already made. But I think we've laid the foundation for a lot of that growth.</p>
<p class="p p6">And so, I don't have a timetable for you, but I do think it's visible. And I do think at some point over the next few years, I think the nature of the dialogue that we'll be having with our shareholders and our analysts around where we are from a distribution perspective, retail is going to be very different than the one that we're having today.</p>
<p class="p p6">Mind you, as I mentioned, we've gone from $9 billion of AUM to, I think, $36 billion of AUM in this space over the last five years. And so, I do think that the trajectory we're on is quite a positive one and gives us confidence in terms of our ability to execute, and as you say, get to that second inning stretch, to use your terminology.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Got it. And then, I think, we'll just pause there for a second. I think, for those kind of tuned in here, we do have audience response questions, should be on a side bar for you guys take a look at. I think the first one is that, we want to make sure you click in through is, how are you involved with KKR right now? I think, overweight, equal weight, underweight or just not involved? There's other ones there, too, so please feel free to respond to all of them, but that one would be kind of reporting on track at this point.</p>
<p class="p p6">And so Rob, I guess back to just the conversation here, when we're talking, you're in the fairly early stages of building out your presence in Asia at this point, too, and kind of taking a little bit of a unique approach to that. First, can you explain a little bit about the Asia strategy and particularly your breadth of products and why you chose the approach you guys chose?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. No, I'm glad you asked about Asia. It's a really exciting part of our business. We mentioned in our last quarterly earnings call that we think one day our Asia business can be as big as our U.S. business and we've got a lot of conviction on that. And let me try and walk you through what we've built and why we feel the way we did. So 15 years ago, we made the determination that it was going to be important for us as a global institution to really have a presence in the Asia region. It's obviously a big reagent and a lot of ground to cover. And we said that let's start off on the private equity side of our business. That's where we had a really obviously compelling business, and we were quite good at private equity in 2005. And so that's where we started.</p>
<p class="p p6">Fast forward to today, we've grown our private equity business. Our last fund was a $9 billion pan-Asia private equity fund. Our fourth Asia private equity fund we announced on our last quarterly call is roughly $11 billion so far, so already about 20% larger than its predecessor fund. And so I think if you were to pull our investors and even our competitors in the region, I think they would say -- largely say that KKR has built the leading private equity franchise in the Asia Pac region.</p>
<p class="p p6">And really, the next stage of our growth is the marriage between what we've built up across Asia and private equity. And so we think best-in-class local teams, country teams across our eight offices there. And so deep local presence in areas like Japan, China, India, Southeast Asia, Korea and Australia. And to take those teams and the business we built up in private equity and to marry that with the global capabilities that we've built up across infrastructure, real estate, credit and now growth equity. And that, we think is the next leg of growth for us in the Asia Pac region. And it's a combination of those two things that give us confidence in our ability to continue to really grow that profile over time.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">And so I gave you some stats on our private equity business and its maturation. If you look, when we started our private equity business, we had $4 billion of AUM in 2007. It took us 11 years to go from $4 billion to around $17 billion, and we were at roughly $17 billion in 2018. It's taken us just another two years to go from $17 billion to $30 billion of AUM, which is where we are right now in our Asia business. And so we've got a lot of growth ahead of us in that part of the world, and we're excited by the teams that we have on the ground doing private equity and some of the newer teams that we've built over the last few years focused on our products where we've got a real global skill set across areas like infra, real estate, credit and growth equity.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. And I guess, just let me comment quick on Asia private equity. I mean, obviously, as you mentioned, it's a tremendous area of growth. It's where you kind of put your foot forward here in the Asia approach at this point. How much more room is there for private equity to keep growing in Asia from here?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I think it's pretty big. Again, think about the regions and countries I went through and how large some of those countries are. And the other two things that I think that you should keep in mind as you think about what the opportunity is for growth in that part of the world as one, where do we see global GDP coming from over the next 10 years? And I think most people would overweight that part of the world to driving more global growth.</p>
<p class="p p7">The other thing I'd say is alternatives as an asset class are still relatively small in terms of their penetration versus the broader asset manager universe. So I think you've got two pretty good secular tailwinds that should drive additional growth. I think the other thing you'd look at across our business today and the teams we've built out is I do think that upfront investment has created some real barriers to enter it. It's not easy for an incumbent to come in and try and take market share across Asia Pac. It's just such a disparate market to operate in that requires really local talent.</p>
<p class="p p7">And I'll give you an example. I actually spent about five years in my career out in Asia as we were getting going. And in those early days, we were probably 50-50 expat and local investment professionals. If you look at our team today, my bet would be that comfortably north of 95% of our team is local to the region in which they cover. And that's been a critical transition for us as we've matured that business over the last 15 years.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And that – that local investment team based on the ground, I would assume that there's a lot of externalities that go through there. But does that kind of persist through, I think, the next kind of big push-out in Asia, I think was alternative credit. Were you talking mainly about -- I wouldn't assume the benefits are isolated to just the private equity part of the business. I would think that we're talking about the big swath of things, right?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I think the benefits are huge. But I think there is two key benefits with having the local team. The biggest benefit actually is if you want to be a global investor and you want to -- and you have a goal of being able to generate top quartile returns over multiple fund products over a long period of time, you need to have a global mindset. And what is undoubtedly true is that we are better investors in all markets, in all products by virtue of the expertise that we have on the ground in Asia.</p>
<p class="p p7">I think the second benefit, and you hit on it, is having that local team does allow for us to be able to, I think, launch new products with a different level of resources that maybe somebody else who is new to the market would require. So as we think about launching infrastructure, real estate or credit or growth equity, our ability to leverage the teams that we already have on the ground is a huge advantage that we've got out there. We run truly an integrated model across the entire firm but certainly out in the Asia Pac region.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Got it. And then, I guess touching on alternative credit as well. What's perhaps the primary focus of what you're looking to spin up in kind of the Asian part of the geography? And I guess just more broadly speaking, when you think about how you're approaching new markets or new strategies in new types of markets, can you just give us a rough idea, like what dictates that rollout? Is it LP-driven? Or are they approaching you? Is it something where you guys are looking at top down and saying, hey, I think we can make an impact here? Any comments and color on that would be fantastic.</p>
<p class="p p8"> </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Sure. So I mean, there was two separate questions in there. The first -- I'll try to remember them. The first, in alternative credit, our focus in the Asia region, at least at the outset, is going to be opportunistic in nature, I think, predominantly, at least at the outset, focused on more performing credit. And as you know, Jeremy, we run really an integrated credit and capital markets platform across the U.S. and Europe. It allows for us to have a differentiated approach to the marketplace, and I think it's allowed for us to create a really unique business model. We intend to follow that same approach in Asia Pac as we're rolling out our credit business, so really very much an integrated approach between credit and capital markets. And that's already started to pay dividends in places like Australia and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p class="p p8">And then you asked a separate question on what dictates, I think, the rollout of our different products. We do not want to be all things to all people. And so we've got a goal here that if we're going to be in a business, we either need to be top 3 or we need to feel like we've got a path to being top 3 in that business. And so that's why we started with private equity in Asia. We felt that was an area where we could be top 3 initially or certainly grow to that. We didn't feel that same way if you would have asked us five or seven years ago in things like infrastructure, real estate or even credit. And so that's why we've waited. And as we've built out that global capability in those asset classes, that's when we decided that it was really time to launch those platforms in the Asia region as opposed to doing it before then because we just wouldn't have had the conviction that we were going to be able to create something that was sufficiently scalable, where we'd be a top three player here in the marketplace, but we feel that way, too.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Great. And just kind of an update here on some of our responses to the KKR involvement question. 35% of some of the respondents say that they're overweight, 10% equal weight. As of right now, nobody is underweight. And 55% are not involved. So with the not involved in mind, Rob, let's touch on fundraising, I guess, for a moment here and see if you can push these into one of the other buckets for yourself.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">That's a big undecided category, okay.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So when we think about like fundraising, obviously, it's the primary driver to get to your 50% management fee growth over the next three years. And you had a pretty impressive 2Q. I think $16 billion is a quarterly record for you, isn't it?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. Thanks for mentioning it. It was a record for us not only -- but I think actually, qualitatively, one of the important things is, it was a record in both our private markets business lines as well as a separate record in our public markets business line. So there is real diversification of where the fundraising was across our platform.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Got you. And you've been building out, and we've talked about all these different types of things that we talked about earlier today, right? Asia, health care, next-gen tech. Now you're on your second, third, fourth iterations of a lot of these funds. As these strategies start aging, what are we thinking about next on a go-forward basis?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yeah. Listen, it wouldn't surprise you that there's always a focus here to a degree on what we can build out next. But I would say to you, we've got a lot of young businesses, and we've got an opportunity to scale things that we've got on the ground today.</p>
<p class="p p9">And we've articulated, certainly, an aspirational goal here is to be able to double our profitability over the next five years and then to go ahead and double it again in the five years after that. We think we've got the product set today to be able to do that. That doesn't mean that we're not going to start something that's new over time. I think in all likelihood, we would. But I think more likely is that if we do start something new, it's not going to be something that doesn't already leverage the core capabilities that are already resident inside of KKR today.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">And then, I guess, just with this environment that we're in right now, right, where we're doing this virtually instead of sitting together at a stage in Manhattan, how do we think about your ability is going to raise funds either in successor funds with LPs, so in areas where you're known for versus kind of spinning up new strategies? Obviously, it didn't hurt you this past quarter here, so, just trying to get a feel for that dynamic.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yeah. Again, we don't have a lot of new things today. If you look at our product set, and I think we've talked about 20-plus products come to market in younger businesses, a lot of those businesses have already raised funds. And so -- and have track record of our investors to know those people.</p>
<p class="p p9">And so I think we've benefited through this period of time where you're doing a lot of fundraising on Zoom, from having this decade long relationship, decade plus long relationship with investors, I think the credibility of our institutional platform, I think our long-term track record, I think that's all near to our benefit on a relative basis versus the upstart competitor who's trying to launch their business in a Zoom environment. I've got to imagine that that's harder.</p>
<p class="p p9">And so, I think well-established players and firms, like ourselves, but there's others like us, too, I think, have naturally benefited from this period of time, where long-term relationships and long-term track records, I think, probably matter a little bit.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Got you. And then, I think like you guys pointed out in the last time, you're starting to raise successor funds a little bit earlier than you might have otherwise done so in the past. I think if I remember, the wording was when capital is committed to investment, maybe not yet invested properly yet. Am I remembering that right?</p>
<p class="p p9">And, I usually think about like a rule of thumb is like 60-ish percent investment so you start raising successor funds. Can you just remind us if there's any kind of rule of thumb for us to look at? I know each of these might be a little bit different, but help us think through that at all.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yeah. The first is, as it's committed or -- excuse me, it's invested or committed, would be -- and so you had that right, not just what's invested in the fund. I'd say rule of thumb, but all situations are different, is when a fund becomes somewhere around two-thirds invested or committed, we start thinking about what's our fundraising strategy going forward.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Got you. As we kind of approach the kind of the finish line here, let me just pivot over. I want to just talk a little bit about your recent inclusion in the Russell indices. Obviously, the stock has rallied a bit on the inclusion. But, how’s your shareholder base or I guess, I should say, perhaps your engagement with prospective shareholders, like perhaps the 55% uninvolved right now at this point? How has that changed since then?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yeah. So, I think there's two components of the opportunity from Russell inclusion. The first was the index purchasing, and we saw roughly 20 million shares that were purchased in Q2, so fairly meaningful. We've always said, we think the more meaningful opportunity here for us is to be able to market ourselves to firms that are benchmarked against the Russell. And that's a whole additional universe for us and why we're very happy and excited to be doing sessions like this one, Jeremy, and thank you for including us.</p>
<p class="p p10">And so, I would say the nature of dialogue we're having with a number of prospective shareholders is different than the one we had pre-Russell inclusion. And that's been a natural evolution for us really since we converted to a C-corp, just it's an all different universe of shareholders that I think are looking at our space, and the Russell Index inclusion was just the next leg of that, that I think has opened up an additional set of dialogues.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">And then, Rob, I guess in that vein, personally, we're still doing a lot of kind of one-on-one level teachings about not only KKR, but just alts in general, because of the full C-corp index inclusion narrative.</p>
<p class="p p10">I guess in your experience, when you're talking to these newer investors or newer potential investors, how are you characterizing them between people that were wanting to be involved and perhaps, in some way, either restricted either from a pre C-corp level or not my index kind of level versus people that are really brand new to the entire ecosystem that, again, as you kind of alluded to that you might be engaging for the first time?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Sorry, I missed -- you broke up halfway through on the question for me, Jeremy.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">So, how would you characterize like your investor dialogue from analysts or PMs that wanted to get involved that were somehow internally restricted, either pre C-corp or not in my index versus just starting to kind of learn about and take a look at alt?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yeah. I would say, post C-corp conversion, for sure, it was heavily weighted towards institutions who either couldn't own us or wouldn't own us by virtue of our corporate structure. </p>
<p class="p p10">Today, I would say the conversations that we're having are probably equally weighted, Jeremy, between those who have known us for a long time, have invested with us or invested in our space or know the space incredibly well and those who are just starting to get up to speed on the space, know the space a little bit, but haven't really invested into it before. So probably an equal number of discussions on both sides today.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Got you. And then in our last minute or so here, I just wanted to ask a quick one on monetization and kind of -- they're obviously impressive last quarter, especially given the backdrop of all the market volatility we had. Any updates here on monetization as we get kind of close to the quarter? I think you guys mentioned about $250 million expected gains on the last quarterly earnings call?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">We did, yes. I don't have an update for you on this call. Yes, we had mentioned that on our Q2 call that as to the date of that call, I guess, that would have been in early August, we have discussed [ph] on approximately $250 million of realized balance sheet and carry gains coming through the P&amp;L in Q3.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Got you. And then, I guess in that vein, too, when we think about kind of margin, maybe a little bit on more on the fee earning side, you're already a pretty high level here. But if you're bringing Global Atlantic at really high kind of incremental margins, how do you think about kind of margin expansion for KKR as an entity on a go-forward basis in addition to all the kind of the top line, 50% management fee growth that you're expecting?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Lewin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Yes. I think there's going to be two waves of margin expansion in our business. The first wave is if we're able to achieve the management fee growth targets that we have so have grown our management fees by 50% over the next few years plus the $200 million from our Global Atlantic is incremental to that 50% growth, I think that should drive real margin expansion in our business.</p>
<p class="p p11"> </p>
<p class="p p11"> I think the second wave of margin expansion is probably more medium-term in nature. I think it is definitely a part of our business that is less well understood. But a few years back, we made the decision to focus our balance sheet on more long-term compounding. The offset to a decision like that, it was for sure that it is the right decision for KKR, but the offset to a decision like that is the near-term impact it will have is less distributable earnings as those assets are performing create embedded gains. </p>
<p class="p p11">At some point in the future, if we're doing our job right and those assets are generating the right levels of return for us, they're going to crystallize either in terms of realized gains or realized dividends or interest that is going to come through our distributable revenue. When that materializes over the next several years or if that materializes, and certainly, we have conviction on the investments that we've been making, we believe that could be an additional layer of margin, but that's more medium-term in nature.</p>
<p class="p p11">So the one that I think is more near-term is our management fee growth, 50% plus the Global Atlantic management fee growth, and then the medium-term is really around our balance sheet migrating from something that is compounding in nature for right now to something that is a contributor to our distributable earnings over time.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Jeremy Campbell</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Great. Well, I think we're about at time, Rob. Thank you so much for being here. It was a pleasure speaking with you.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Rob Lewin</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Yes. Jeremy, thanks a lot to Barclays and you for including us, and it was a good conversation. Thank you.</p>
