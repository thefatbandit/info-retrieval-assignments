<p class="p p1"><strong>Ricky Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today at Morgan Stanley’s Global Healthcare Conference. I’m Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley’s Healthcare Services Analyst, and I’m very pleased to have Cardinal’s CEO, Mike Kaufmann here with us today.</p>
<p class="p p1">Cardinal is one of the top three driving medical product distributors in the country. They’ve played in a critical role for the nation during the last six months and during the COVID pandemic and we have a lot to talk about in the next 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="p p1">But before we get started, please note that this webcast is for Morgan Stanley’s clients and appropriate Morgan Stanley’s employees only and that the webcast is not for members of the press. So if you are a member of the press, please disconnect and reach out separately.</p>
<p class="p p1">Then for important disclosures, please see the Morgan Stanley recent disclosure Web site at www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. And if you have any questions, please reach out to your Morgan Stanley sales representative.</p>
<p class="p p1">And with that, I’d turn it over to Kevin Moran first for some additional disclosures and then Mike for some introductory remarks.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Kevin Moran</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thanks, Ricky. Thanks for hosting us today. During the fireside chat, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected here today. For information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from today’s projections, please refer to our SEC filings which you can find on the Investors page of our Web site.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Mike Kaufmann</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. Thanks, Kevin, and thanks, Ricky. Really appreciate the opportunity to speak to you and to everyone today, and thanks to everyone for joining us. In FY20, we really delivered on our commitments, which is incredibly important to us. We grew non-GAAP operating earnings despite $100 million net headwind from COVID-19 and we exceeded our EPS guidance range. We surpassed our enterprise cost savings target and are definitely on track to hit our goal of 500 million over a five-year period.</p>
<p class="p p1">We’ve made strategic portfolio decisions and we’ve strengthened our balance sheet during FY20, which ended June 30. And also while COVID-19 has been incredibly challenging for everyone in so many different ways, it has made our mission clearer than ever as we are focused on our customers and those in need to get them the medical and pharmaceutical supplies they need, and I’m really proud of our FY20 performance and really excited about FY21 and the future of the company.</p>
<p class="p p1">So with that, I’ll just turn it over to you, Ricky, and let you begin asking whatever questions you would like.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Ricky Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. Thank you, Mike. So Cardinal is in a unique position. You have visibility into drug-trended pharmacies, in utilization and medical facilities that’s factored in your medical and specialty segments. Can you update us on how have volumes across the U.S. business been trending in July, August and September to date compared to pre-COVID baseline and compared to your expectations?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Mike Kaufmann</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, this far in the quarter it’s a fair question. We typically don’t do any updates during the middle of the quarter. And there are a lot of moving parts, whether it be our generics program, our expense initiatives, et cetera, but I will give you some color on this.</p>
<p class="p p1">As you know on the medical side, we would say that elective procedures which we indicated we thought would advertise single digits down for the year, enter in the mid high teens and exit our fiscal year hopefully close back to prior pre-COVID levels. Right now what we're seeing in the first few months of this quarter is things trending a little bit better on the elective side.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Now, it's definitely lumpy week-to-week. One week, we'll see it about as expected. Next week will be a little bit better. But overall, I would say on the elective side, it is running a little bit better than we expected. On the pharma side, there's a lot of various data out there. I would say it's also very lumpy there, probably even larger swings on that side week-to-week, but that one I would say has net just a little bit softer than we expected on the pharma side.</p>
<p class="p p2">So net-net, we're still about where we had hoped to be for the quarter, but a little bit better on the electives and maybe a little bit worse on the pharma side, but both being lumpy. And so we'll look forward to updating that as we go along through the year and get a sense of where we're going to end up.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Ricky Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">So, Mike, obviously we’re in a dynamic and a very fluid marketplace and to your quote, it's lumpy. But when you think about recent months, how has the experience shaped your views on the potential trajectory of recovery as we head into the fall and winter sessions? There are different views out there in terms of that shape of recovery. You have been a little bit more I'd say conservative than some of the others. So from what you've seen in the last couple of months, has any of that kind of changed how you think about progression into the fall and winter?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Mike Kaufmann</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. Like I said, I'll touch base on each one of them. Again on electives, while they're trending lumpy but in that a little bit better than we expected, I think the big question for us is will it get back to pre-COVID levels by the end of our year? It very well could be. That was our assumption at the beginning of the year, but we're really keeping our eye on really the desire of the patient, consumer, whatever you would like to call them, to be willing to come back into the hospital setting, into the nursing home settings and into those settings again, and will patients continue to put off procedures.</p>
<p class="p p2">Also, we're seeing regional flare ups here and there. We're also seeing some things, as you know, when I talked to some of the hospital CEOs, there is some of them that seem a little bit concerned that what we're seeing is just the patients that had to have the procedures, which is why we're seeing it maybe come back a little stronger. Well, how long will that continue?</p>
<p class="p p2">And so, right now, I would just say we're only a couple of months in, like I said, a little bit better on the elective side but there's a lot of innings left in this game and there's a lot of factors that I think we need to keep in mind, including whether the flu season will impact some of this differently than it has historically. So again, we're continuing to just keep our eyes on it, but hopeful that we can continue to see this run ahead of where it's been, but it's just way too early to call it for the year.</p>
<p class="p p2">On the – more on the physician office visit or more particularly to script volume, again lumpy but seeing it slightly behind new Rxs, down a little bit. And so again, we're continuing to keep our eyes on that and make sure that hopefully patients will be comfortable getting back into the physicians' offices, they'll start writing for the appropriate prescriptions and we'll begin to see that pick up.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Ricky Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">And when we think about – you highlighted the desire of consumers to come back. When you think about just structural changes to behavior from what you've observed in the marketplace, are there any structural changes to behavior that you can point to from trends, whether it's independent versus national accounts, individual behavior, anything that you can build on when you think about how these changes could open new opportunities that you can build on in a post pandemic world?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Mike Kaufmann</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, it's a great question. Clearly, we've seen some structural changes just in the way our customers operate, right. The way you go into a hospital or physician office visit, oftentimes you're waiting in the parking lots or you're – they're only allowing so many people in and those types of things. And so I think throughput continues to be a question that we're going to keep our eyes on for the rest of the years to make sure that our hospital customers, physician offices are able to get back to the throughput levels they used to have even though they have different procedures in place than they have historically. And so we're going to keep our eyes on that.</p>
<p class="p p3">As far as structural changes in our customer base, I would say that our retail pharmacies and retail independence have held up pretty well. They have significant customer loyalty. Our retail independence, as I said, because of their loyalty, they seem to be holding up pretty well. We've seen nursing home volumes obviously be down some a little bit in those areas with some of those customers. Mail order has been a little bit stronger. Chains have been performing well.</p>
<p class="p p3">I think the chains, also particularly a few of them, some of our larger customers have done an excellent job of really capitalizing upon being able to be testing centers. I think they're going to do some amazing work around giving vaccines when they're available. And they've just done a good job of ramping up and being ready to do those types of things. And so, overall, we've seen some changes, but it's still so very early to understand exactly what's permanent or not permanent. We continue to believe that our programs, our superior service levels, particularly in the generic areas, continues to be a real benefit for Cardinal I think versus the rest of our competitors. We’re doing a really good job there with Red Oak.</p>
<p class="p p3">As far as ourselves as a business, I think the one area where we're really looking at making some structural changes will be in our sourcing area on the medical side. We're continuing to look at the percentage of products we're buying from each country; which countries we are buying from, where we make it, manufacture more ourselves. We've been investing significantly in new mask and gown production, for instance, where we produce whether it's U.S. or treaty friendly or closer countries has been important. So a lot of things that we're doing in that business to both drive down our expenses, but also manage the diversity of our supply chain has been some really important work that the team has been doing.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Ricky Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And, Mike, this is a good segue to talk a little bit about the medical segment. You've got it for the medical segment profit to be down in high-single digit in fiscal '21. But if we think about normalizing for COVID that profit I think you said would be up mid-single digits. So can you help us just think through in rank order the drivers that make up for the difference?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Mike Kaufmann</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, the biggest piece is we mentioned this past year we had a net $100 million negative impact in FYI20 from COVID-19. It was roughly 30 million of positive in Q3 and 130 million of negative in Q4 to net. We said that we would have a similar size down for FY21. The difference being in FY20, that negative was relatively evenly split between medical and pharma, whereas in FY21 the majority of the incremental headwind is expected to be in medical. And it would really be a couple things that make that up.</p>
<p class="p p3">First of all, we started experiencing higher costs procuring PPE for our customers, particularly masks, gowns and exam gloves. And so those are areas where our cost structure or our cost to purchase those products went up significantly, whether it was the finished good or raw materials for ones we manufacturer, which created some negatives for us late in '20 and early in '21.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">Since then, we have been working with our customers. And although we have a goal never to raise prices, our goal is always to keep healthcare as low as possible for our customers due to the unusual and significant impact that this cost increases have had. We have been working with our customers and began passing through those cost increases in a very transparent and well communicated way with a lot of opportunity for our customers to plan for it, and then for us to work with them.</p>
<p class="p p4">So that is something that is creating some extra headwind for us here in the first half of the year. And then, second of all, again, any deferral cancellation of elective procedures for us, because of the mix of our products being more skewed to higher valued products than PPE that some of our competitors would see as a positive driver, for us having the negative – less surgeries in the mix of our products, that headwind has also been a large headwind for us.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Ricky Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So, Mike, to that point, just wanted to go back and tie it to your earlier remarks about seeing elective procedures doing a little bit better and pharma being a little bit lumpier. As we think about that dynamic, that dynamic should be positive for margin given that profile that you're talking about. Is that fair?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Mike Kaufmann</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Well, it depends on which business. Obviously, for pharma, it would be a negative with volumes down. On medical, it would be a positive with volumes up being one company at this point in time. We don't see anything that would change our overall perspective for the year at this time, but we can continue to monitor this. And it will be something that we’ll absolutely keep our eye on, but we are – it's nice to see the elective procedures be better. And again, particularly for us, because we're higher skewed towards the higher end products that are used in many of these electric procedures, particularly the OR, so yes. In our medical business, we could see that as a tailwind or a positive for us in the quarter. And then in the pharma business, we could see it be slight negative.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Ricky Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. And just wanted to remind to everybody who's listening to the webcast, if you have any questions for Mike, please just type it into the portal and I will relate your question. So obviously, vaccine distribution is on top of everybody's mind. The CDC selected McKesson as a distributor. But how do you think the market will evolve over time? And I think my first question there is, is how do you think about market evolving but also the different sites of administration for COVID vaccine compared to the traditional flu vaccine or anything we've seen in the past?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Mike Kaufmann</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, I think the flu vaccine’s a good proxy in many ways is that as an industry we've all been distributing the flu vaccine for many years. We all have capabilities. I'm very confident in Cardinal’s capabilities to dispense vaccines, a COVID vaccine, because we've been doing it with many of the other vaccines for years, whether it's ambient controlled or whether it's all the way to deep frozen [ph], we have the capabilities to manage those. And I think the important component of is that this is a much significant, more number of doses potentially if the manufacturers are able to make it. So it's going to be far more doses potentially than the flu vaccine. I think that's one thing to keep in mind.</p>
<p class="p p4">Each vaccine is going to have different types of controls that it's going to need on it again from a temperature standpoint and reporting standpoint. And I don't think it's – I think it's something that the entire industry would be willing and able to participate in. And I think it's the smart thing and sense of making sure that there's no single point of failure for something as important to this. I also think it's really important that our customers select their distributors in a sole – in a primary way in their systems to receive product, pay for it, track it, et cetera, are set up in ways that make it much easier for them to get it from their current prime distributor.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">And so we think it would be better both for the customers and the industry that we were all part of this. We understand there'll be some probably limited doses for a while and there's some really good reasons to do some different things. But as it becomes more available, I think it's best for the ultimate consumer and for the retail chains and independents in other locations that will be distributing the vaccine that they are able to work with their primary distributor. So, again, excited that we have the capabilities and we're willing to do our part in helping as many people as possible.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p5"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Ricky Goldwasser</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, it seems striking really the magnitude, the scale and scope of the operation and I think the partnership and cooperation that that's probably going to be needed there. One question that we got from the audience is, how will the approval of the COVID vaccine and in therapeutic help or hurt your business? What would it mean for Cardinal in calendar 2021? And I think that part of the question here is when you think about the timing of vaccine and how long it's going to take to scale, do you think that this is a fiscal '21 or more for fiscal '22 impact to your line items?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Kaufmann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, I would say right now it's just too early to know. There's so many variables. For instance, we don't know when it's going to be approved. We don't know how many doses are going to be approved. We don't know who's actually buying the product. Will it be the government buying it and then shipping it to us to ship it? We don't know what type of margins would be appropriate. And it would partially depend on the type of storage and the cost of storage as well as who's owning it. So it is really hard to predict. What I can tell you is we don't have anything in our FY21 guidance that assumes COVID.</p>
<p class="p p5">So I think if COVID vaccine approval and distribution, so if something were to be approved sooner rather than later and we were participating, there could be some upside to us during the year. Most importantly for me, I think the real upside is just getting the overall obviously economy going back and getting people more and more comfortable to go into the hospital, in the doctor's office to get their treatments, which I think that builds up over time and would clearly be more of a '22 benefit as people get their confidence back and back in the entire healthcare system to be able to come in. But as far as the vaccine goes, at this point in time I think it would just be really hard to comment. But as I mentioned, we don't have anything in our current guidance that assumes any profit on the vaccine distribution.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Ricky Goldwasser</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. And another question that we received is regarding the pharmacy segment and what specifically is driving the pharmacy? We saw the softness that you're referring to.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Kaufmann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, it's hard to say exactly. I think it's probably a combination of things. I think it's less physician office visits. We've also seen some data that would say, as people do telehealth visits, that the average number of scripts done at a telehealth visit is less than a normal physician office visit. I've had a chance to dig into a lot of detail on that, some recent information that I've seen. And again, that may just be due to the acuity of the patient using it, maybe nothing more than that. But I think it's really just lack of physician office visits generating the level of scripts that it has historically, and I think it's going to take a while to catch up to that. I don't think it's anything that I think is long-term negative. I just think people are still getting their confidence back and going to the physician's office. And I think that some of this throughput challenges also could be part of the equation there.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Ricky Goldwasser</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And one addition – go ahead, Mike.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Kaufmann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, I would just emphasize. Remember, it's lumpy. So I think it's too early to say that the whole year is going to be less than that. It's just that we've just seen some lumpiness and that it's just a little bit behind if you look at like the IQVIA data and some of the other data.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Ricky Goldwasser</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Mike, you talked about kind of like the telehealth and the impact it has and the type of prescription that are being written. We've had some questions from people on the line that's somewhat related. And how do you think this emergence that we're seeing of online pharmacies could impact the generic business in the future? And I think that – it’s just that I’m trying to understand if online pharmacies source directly from the manufacturers or from your perspective retail tiers, another pharmacy that you have an opportunity to network with?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Kaufmann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, I see it more as the latter that it's just another type of pharmacy location that we have a chance to serve. I think that it would – while some of them are clearly growing, none of them are at a scale that purchasing generics on their own, in my opinion, would be something that would be advantageous. So I still think looking to distributor partners with our large buying capabilities I think is going to be smart not only from a net better cost, but I think that from a service level standpoint, the capabilities, for instance, that we have at Red Oak to monitor service level by manufacturer understand where raw material challenges may be throughout the globe, moving our supply chain to the right suppliers. Those are really important things that someone has to take into account.</p>
<p class="p p6">If they – even if they could buy a little bit cheaper on an item for a while, the risk is if they choose the wrong supplier and aren't able to move quickly and know in advance, all of a sudden they could be saving a little bit and then be out of stock. And then they're going to pay significantly more when they're only picking it up on a kind of as needed basis from their distributors. We're obviously going to charge a lot more money for folks that are just having us in a backup position than we will with someone who's in a primary position. So net-net, if they look at the entire cost of ownership when it comes to days of inventory they're able to carry, overall, cost of goods and the impact of service level I still think that they're going to look at distributors as their best option. And we clearly believe with Red Oak, with our scale and capabilities, we’d probably put ourselves in a great position.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Ricky Goldwasser</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And then shifting gears to opioids, obviously an important factor as investors think about the opportunities to invest into Cardinal and the group. States are under a lot of fiscal [ph] pressure and the latest media articles on the conversation between distributors and states suggest that that gap between the offer for distributors to what the state AGs are looking for is getting closer. Do you think that states are now more open to some sort of a creative solution?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Kaufmann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">It's hard to define what the word creative would be. I would tell you that we continue and have continued to actively work with the state AGs. We want to be part of the solution. Again, if we can't reach the right and fair resolution, we're ready to go to trial and we’ll defend ourselves vigorously. But we think it's best for everyone if we can find an appropriate resolution here to bring meaningful relief, both in funds and distribution of medication into communities. All that we see is really important. And all I can really say is we do continue to have I would say productive discussions and we'll continue to try to bring this to a close if possible.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Ricky Goldwasser</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And Mike, on that topic, there seems to be some confusion based on the questions that we're getting regarding how many states are involved in the most recent conversations. So I just want to confirm that when you and your peers and the state AGs are sitting down and working together, it stirred a global settlement that involves all states involved and not just the states that are mentioned in the media?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Kaufmann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, that's correct, Ricky. We believe that for this to make sense, we really need to have a global settlement with all 50 states. We think that that's important to be able to really get clarity to investors and to us and to be able to agree to something. And so we always have and we'll continue to have a goal of getting all 50 states, and as well as being able to work with them in a way to make sure that all of the other cities and counties come in, in an effective way too. So, yes, that's always been our goal and nothing's changed on that.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Ricky Goldwasser</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And I think we're running out of time, so given that this is an election year, I have to ask that one. Can you just help us make sense of the President's executive order on drug prices, any thoughts there?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Kaufmann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, the only thing I can say is, you and I have had this discussion for a while now. And as you know, with our CSA agreements, first of all for it to really negatively impact the distributors or impact, because I wouldn’t even use the word negative, to have an impact on the distributors because now well over 95% is non-contingent to inflation, it really has to be something that would affect the manufacturers such that they would desire to reduce their WAC or their list prices.</p>
<p class="p p7">And even if that's happened and we've seen some of that in one-offs with some of these brand equivalents that manufacturers have launched, even though our current DSAs are tied to WAC prices, we have shown a history to be able to effectively work with the manufacturer. They all understand we've been very direct with them and worked with them to know that while [indiscernible], it's all about the dollars we receive for the services that we provide. And if they need to cut their WAC by – just make the math easy in half, then they've got to double the fee in order for us to keep our dollars consistent. I believe that all manufacturers are very aware of this.</p>
<p class="p p7">We have a history of working with them when these things have happened to successfully resolve those. And while it might cause a little short-term disruption as we work through the adjustments, I don't see this being a mid to long-term issue for the distributors. And so again, while we keep our eyes on all these executive orders and various pieces of potential legislation, I believe our system is built to be able to work through this with the manufacturers in order for us as distributors to get paid what we deserve.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Ricky Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, Mike and Kevin, thank you very much for joining us today at Morgan Stanley's Global Healthcare Conference. This concludes our session. And for everybody on the line, thank you for listening.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Mike Kaufmann</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Take care, Ricky. Take care, everybody.</p></div>
