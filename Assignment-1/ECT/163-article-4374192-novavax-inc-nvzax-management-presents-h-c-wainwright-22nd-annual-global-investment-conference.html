<p class="p p1"><strong>Vernon Bernardino</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning, everyone and thank you for attending the H.C. Wainwright 22nd Annual Global Investment Conference. My name is Vernon Bernardino and I am an H.C. Wainwright senior analyst. While we are virtual this year we are confident we are going to be able to provide you with over 500 companies presenting at this conference and we think that it is our value as well as via your interactions through one-on-one meetings, we think you will have a really great conference.</p>
<p class="p p1">As you know, H.C. Wainwright is a full service investment bank dedicated to providing corporate finance strategic advisory and related services to public and private companies across multiple sectors and regions. We also provide research and sales training services to institutional investors and we are pleased to have you with us today. For our attendees at our healthcare company sessions this week, note that we offer 12 publishing senior healthcare hours covering 380 healthcare companies dedicated equity research for healthcare companies, ongoing doctor calls, diseases and symposiums and other healthcare focused events and a total of 458 companies are covered across all sectors. From a logistic standpoint, please make sure to reference your schedule sheet that provides you individual links to your meetings. Today, only today please also be sure not to miss our virtual entertainment event this evening at 6 o’clock. Sorry for the fun, but I am going to say it’s going to be funtastic.</p>
<p class="p p1">With that said, we have a productive, enjoyable day and I would like to introduce our first presenter, which will be Dr. Gregory Glenn, President of R&amp;D and John Trizzino, Chief Business Officer and CFO of Novavax. This is a company specializing in next generation vaccines and one of the frontrunners in the race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Take over, Greg and John.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Gregory Glenn</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. Thank you very much. We appreciate the introduction. And we are excited to be participating in the H.C. Wainwright Virtual Investment Conference today. So, let me jump right into our presentation. If I could take you to the first slide and just talk about the significant progress that we are making. Yes, please. And this is an exciting time for the company obviously and we are laser focused on all of our coronavirus vaccine candidate activities.</p>
<p class="p p1">Just a couple of quick highlights to kind of kick things off for the presentation today is we have presented very positive Phase 1 results of our CoV2373 candidate. We are executing our Phase 2 clinical trial and through the presentation we will give you an update on what that clinical development plan looks like. To-date, we have received over $2 billion in funding for all of our coronavirus vaccine development activities from CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations and then of course, the $1.6 billion we received from Operation Warp Speed. Our NanoFlu program, it continues to be a priority as well, with this past year receiving very positive data from our primary objective on our Phase 3 clinical trial and we still are focused on completing our CMC activities and filing for our BLA submission under our accelerated approval pathway.</p>
<p class="p p1">Lastly, from a high level perspective, our balance sheet is very strong and has strengthened significantly with $610 million in cash being reported at the end of the second quarter as of June 30. We continue to grow the organization in order to support our coronavirus development activities as well as our other priority pipeline, which is on the next slide.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">So as you can see here, just a brief summary, our CoV2373 continues to be our high priority focus. NanoFlu completed its Phase 3 trial and moving on to BLA finalization and then submission. Our RSV program continues to be something that we would engage back in likely into 2021 year. We believe that all of the work on our technology platform or recombinant protein nanoparticle well positions us to reengage back on RSV.</p>
<p class="p p2">With that, what I would like to do is now hand it over to Dr. Gregory Glenn to take you through some data slides from our Phase 1 trial.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Gregory Glenn</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Great. Thank you, John. So, let’s start with the first slide. So, Novavax is making a spike protein based vaccine. And as John mentioned, the work we are doing here really harkens back to all our other programs in terms of the understanding the vaccinology and the structure of these vaccines and how important it is. And so this upper picture here is the primary structure. One thing I would just point out is that we have a full-length glycoprotein. So, these proteins normally sit on the surface of the virus and we are making one that really replicates what you would see in nature and that’s going to be important for developing strong immune responses. So, we make a full-length protein and as you can see it pictured below there, couple of papers submitted on the structure and the obviously the primary structure and the 3D structure and the immunogenicity we cite there below in the preprint arena.</p>
<p class="p p2">One of the point of course we are using Matrix-M, so we have an adjuvant spike protein vaccine, Matrix-M. We have had tremendous amount of very positive experiences you will see in a minute though have been a critical feature of our vaccine and our drug product, which is both the spike protein and the Matrix-M are combined together to single vial. So, this protein and these components are very stable. They are certainly we envision that this vaccine would be using the standard cold chain, which you know just globally, it’s going to be very important for distribution not to have a frozen product, you could see if we have, our PPPR [ph] product profile will be a liquid formulation stable today. So, it’s using the cold chain in a vial.</p>
<p class="p p2">If you go to the next slide, we recently were gratified to see the recognition of the quality of our data published in the New England Journal and this is sort of – I think really good validation that our technology and I think the hallmark of our vaccine is its immunogenicity and safety and that was certainly detailed in this paper. So, if you go to the next slide, we will talk a little bit about what we are doing in trial. That trial that was published in New England Journal is a top blue – green band there. That trial triggered the standing up of really four other trials. So, having seen there was the – given – we gave the results to the FDA, they have reviewed it and allow us to go into the Phase 2 U.S. and Australia trial. That trial was designed to expand on the population to older adult population. And when we have that result, it will be an interim result provided to the FDA. That should trigger the start of the Phase 3 trial. So the two – the number two there demonstrates that and we expect that to be in the October timeframe. So, that’s going very well, very far along.</p>
<p class="p p2">We also – the study result from the Phase 1 trial triggered the opening up of the Phase 2 trial in Australia. You can see the trials in blue are assessing efficacy and I will say they are very – they are harmonized in a sense that the endpoint acquisition very similar in all these settings and these essentially represent shots on goal if you will to demonstrate the vaccine is working and the Phase 2b in South Africa was done, because it’s a high transmission setting and very high quality investigators that we have known well for years and allowed us to also include a number of the at high risk population, there you can see we have a population of HIV subjects also receiving the vaccine.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">We will also shortly initiate a Phase 3 trial in UK. UK, as you can know, has a very high quality trial setting. They have an upswing in disease, a good understanding of the geography and that trial is set to begin shortly. And then as I mentioned earlier, the Phase 3 trial in the U.S. is a 30,000 person trial, harmonized with the Operation Warp Speed trials that are being funded in terms of the endpoints and trial conduct principles. Now, all these trials are endpoint driven trials and there is opportunities for interim analyses. So, right now, we are not projecting a timeframe for efficacy, if those long bars represent the safety follow-ups, it’s incorporated into those trials. So, we have begun, it’s for us the big deal we have got begun to embark on the efficacy stage of evaluation of this vaccine.</p>
<p class="p p3">So if you go to the next slide, I would just like to tell you why we are buoyant in terms of our feeling that these vaccines could be highly efficacious. This is from the Phase 1 trial published in the New England Journal. This is a trial of the wild-type neutralization. In my view, as a principle for vaccines against infectious diseases using this Type 1 fusion protein mechanism like spike protein, like RSV, like flu, this – we know that neutralization works. So, in the context of RSV, the use of monoclonal antibodies, in naïve subjects have been definitely shown to protect against viral infection. And so we have a lot of hope that this type of assay will be indicative of what might be protected.</p>
<p class="p p3">And what you see here is a wild-type neutralization assay done by the University of Medicine – University of Maryland School of Medicine, Matt Freeman and his group using a IC of 100%, if you will, so in wild-type neutralization and each bar represents kind of the groups on the left you can see the placebo, that column so no responses that these folks I should again reiterate that they are immunized at Day 0 of 21 and so you have seen after one and two doses and the Day 0. So you can see Day 0 and 21, 35, no response to placebo. The next column is the antigen by itself given at Day 0 and 21 again, very modest and neutralizing antibody responses. When you add the adjuvant, which you see in the next columns, you see a market increase in the amount of neutralizing antibody response. And when you give a second dose, you see yet again another more than one log increase in neutralizing antibodies to be very high. So, you can see here the value of the adjuvant, the value of the second dose in the far right column is a single dose. And then you can see there is no differentiation between 5 and 25 micrograms of spike protein. And that tells you that you have the peak level response on kind of on the top of the S curve. We know from animals that if you can you dose down, you will get a dose response. So, this indicates in our view that you are close to the peak response of what’s possible in humans.</p>
<p class="p p3">And you can see another way to look at this on the far right we were able to get convalescent sera from Baylor College of Medicine. And frankly, we didn’t know that it would serve like this, but after we did the assay and un-blinded, we noted that the more severe cases gave a higher level of neutralizing antibody so that the subjects who are in red were in the ICU subjects who in blue, where the ER was pretty severe outcomes, hypoxia, shortness of breath, fever, etcetera and then we had some blue who are either had very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. That being said, you can see I think normally in the context of viral infections that severely ill subjects, immune responses in their cases often define from the peak response that you can see and it should be protective. And you can see here our 5 microgram 2 dose regimen all those subjects are hovering around the upper end of what we see in convalescent sera, which is quite good.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">Now, if you go to the next slide, we see here, the same data done in what’s called a reverse human distribution. So, this is the percentage of subjects on the Y-axis 100 down to 0 that have a certain titer on the X-axis going on the bottom there. You can see placebo, nothing that the un-adjuvant doses in red are very minimal when you adjuvant the 25 micrograms one dose, you get a pretty good response. When you give two doses, you really get quite a good response and the key thing here is the population response. And if you hit the next button, I think you will see there focused in on – this is about 94% of the subjects have a license – have a titer, neutralizing antibody titer of around 1,000. And in a trial, there is going to be a curve of responses. And what you really are concerned about as you go into the trial, what does the lower end of the response look like? And you can see here, we really have a very high response and most everybody that should give us optimism, the vaccine should be highly protected in the efficacy study.</p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. So, let’s go to the next Slide. We have had some kind of update, just looking at durability. So, that was showing the responses at through Day 35. Now, you can see we have gone up, but it will go out little bit farther, couple of weeks more and you see a little bit of decay, but very modest. So, you see these same messages, the two dose regimen 5 micrograms really working very well, dose barring high neutralized antibiotic titers and that’s sustained.</p>
<p class="p p4">So, if you go to the next slide, the underlying mechanism for sustaining good responses, antibody responses do relate to the CD4 key health that you induce. So we know Matrix-M the adjuvant with these nanoparticles does induce very robust T-cell responses. You can see at the bottom on the left there, these Th1 responses which are characterized by IL-2, TNF-alpha interferon gamma. And frankly, we are more interested in these polyfunctional T-responses. They are really quite robust in the vaccine group receiving the antigen plus Matrix and almost absent in the un-adjuvant or certainly in the placebo groups. And these cells – these cells are going to increase the antibody affinity which should manifest itself in higher neutralizing antibody and then also T-cell memory affecting the overall durability of the response. So this is very encouraging again to see the CD4 responses have looked like this that would really undergird the strong antibody responses we have been seeing.</p>
<p class="p p4">So if you go to the next slide, overall, we think the safety is very good. This is – we didn’t see SAEs, we didn’t see adverse events with special interest. And then you can see here is the reactogenicity local and you can see for the most part there is nothing or mild. And so this vaccine is characterized by little more accuracy of the second dose, mainly some pain and some tenderness, but really overall, a very good safety profile. If you go to the next slide, these are systemic reactions and again, you can see for the most part, there is really no or mild reactions a little more accuracy on the second dose. You can see the second dose we have two placebos that had some severe reaction. So, we know that there's just some reporting of those types of symptoms than any trial and really no pattern with the exception there is maybe a little more malaise, myalgia and fatigue, but again, the vast majority of these reports are mild or non-existent. So, very good safety profile of these solicited symptoms, are short-lived and we think that this is overall a good profile for a vaccine like this.</p>
<p class="p p4">So if you go to the next slide, I am going to turn it back to John to talk a little bit about the course and the supply.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>John Trizzino</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, thanks Greg. As you all can see, based upon the update that Greg just gave, there has been a tremendous amount of activity that’s taken place over the last 6 to 8 months from early on in January, the sequence being identified although work being done within Greg’s development and discovery group in order to identify a vaccine candidate with significant work being done in the lab and then in turn preclinical animal studies in order to identify that one vaccine candidate Cov2373, that’s been taken into our Phase ½ clinical trial program. So, we have received some significant funding initially from CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation, then that garnered some attention of course from the U.S. government from initially the DoD and then ultimately the $1.6 billion in funding from OWS that allowed us to focus on our large scale manufacturing activities, our Phase 3 30,000 subject clinical trial and then ultimately 100 million doses of manufacturing for OWS.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">On the next slide, we see a little – a summary of some of that infrastructure capacity potential. What we now have in place is FUJIFILM in North Carolina and Texas in the U.S. to support OWS, along with polypeptide and AGC on the West Coast to for OWS as well. Globally, we have expanded with another FUJIFILM facility in the UK, of course, the acquired manufacturing facility in Prague and the Czech Republic now under the name of Novavax CZ and the existing infrastructure from our Matrix-M and Novavax AB in Uppsala. We have partnered with Serum Institute for our significant fill/finish capacity out of Pune in India. This will allow us to provide supply into low and middle income countries. We have also announced a licensing agreement with Takeda for manufacturing of antigen in Japan ultimately for the supply of 250 million doses into Japan. SK Biosciences also announced, is mostly a contract manufacturing organization.</p>
<p class="p p5">Very quickly on to the next slide, is just a very early look at the significant work that we are doing from a demand perspective. It’s important to understand that demand continues to well outpace supply. And just a quick step back to I think what is of concern to most people around the timing of the various vaccine candidates throughout. Let me be very clear that being number one, to present Phase 3 data or number one into submitting for license it doesn’t mean that it’s the best vaccine being number one. It doesn’t also mean that all of the demand is being consumed by that first candidate. And I think we have gone through a very logical and methodical approach to our clinical development program to the global infrastructure for supply and having conversations on multiple fronts about procurement agreements. Already in place is the U.S. government for the 100 million doses, the Government of Canada. We are in continuing discussions with them to finalize that already with them. We already have a plan in place with the UK government for supply of over 60 million doses. We, because of our CEPI commitments, are working collaboratively with CEPI and Gavi and the Covax facility for supply for low, middle and high income countries of course through our arrangement with serum through the government of India and in Japan as I mentioned before as well as South Korea, so, significant work being done here and more announcements to come over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p class="p p5">Next slide So to recap, again, the interim data from the Phase 2 clinical trial, Australia to advance a regulatory strategy from the Phase 1 portion of that trial has been reported. We have got global pivotal Phase 3 coming to start in October, the significant expansion of our manufacturing capabilities on a global basis and of course our ongoing additional partnering work that we are doing leave Novavax extraordinarily and exquisitely positioned to provide benefit globally for this pandemic as well as the potential for [indiscernible] supply post-pandemic. So, we will conclude there and hand it back to Vernon for Q&amp;A.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p5"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Q - Vernon Bernardino</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, we are out of time. So we just leave the Q&amp;A, hopefully to your one-on-one meetings for now, we just would like to thank you for participating in our conference today. We look forward to that date for sure. I am obviously biased, because I cover the company and I have excitedly done so for the past, pretty much 15 years. So send your questions here. I will try to answer them as best as I can. But this is a fast moving company and yes, that operation was speed, but this is a company keeping up with the big boys and we look forward to the progress to come. Thanks, John and thanks, Greg.</p>
