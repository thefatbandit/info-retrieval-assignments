<p class="p p1">With that said, have a productive and enjoyable day. And I would like to introduce our first presenter. I would like to welcome Joseph Kim, who is President and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals. Inovio focuses on DNA medicines to treat HPV, cancer, and infectious diseases. </p>
<p class="p p1">Joseph, the floor is yours. </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Joseph Kim</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you. It’s going to be here this morning, thank you for joining. I will be sharing some of the exciting progress that Inovio is doing in the next 20 minutes. </p>
<p class="p p1">As you know, forward-looking statements as we always do. So, Inovio has developed a powerful DNA medicines platform that uses precisely design plasmids, delivered with our proprietary smart delivery system called CELLECTRA. Along with that, we have over thousand patents issued and pending protecting our platforms and we can generate powerful immune responses safely that can impact clinical results. </p>
<p class="p p1">So, I am going to show you how we do this. But some of the advantages of Inovio’s platform is clinical efficacy demonstrated in Phase 2b study for lead VGX-3100. We also have demonstrated safety that’s been favorable and versatility of boosting of our platforms, our immunotherapies and vaccines can be boosted and we can rapidly manufacture with very stable products. </p>
<p class="p p1">Inovio is the only DNA vaccine that has shown to have thermal stability with shelf life of five years at refrigeration conditions and stabilized room temperature for a year. So, for things like COVID-19 vaccines, these are very important considerations. So, again, three important parts really summarizes Inovio’s advantage. </p>
<p class="p p1">One is, a balanced immune responses that can generate both neutralizing antibodies and T-cells. Number two, we can do this very safely. And number three, our products are stable even at room temperature. So I am going to show you some of our pipeline products held on by our HPV disease programs with VGX-3100, currently in Phase 3 trials for treating cervical dysplasia, caused by HPV-16 and 18 subtypes.</p>
<p class="p p1">We also have expanded the indications into Phase 2 trials in vulvar and anal dysplasia. So I am going to be showing some of that data, as well. Another of our very exciting product is a INO-3107 that treats orphan disease RRP. We also have outlicensed our cancer therapeutics to AstroZeneca that’s currently in Phase 2 trials for head and neck cancer and other cancer types. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">We also have other cancer therapeutics, one for treating glioblastoma in collaborations with Regeneron. We also have a prostate therapeutics currently in clinical trials – Phase 2 clinical trials with The Parker Institute. </p>
<p class="p p2">We have a whole host in addition to our infectious disease vaccines really highlighted by INO-4800 which is our vaccine for COVID-19 and we also have very exciting demand DNA launched monoclonal antibody program in clinical trials as well. </p>
<p class="p p2">So I am going to take my first few minutes covering exciting updates on COVID-19 vaccine development. As you know, Inovio has launched its COVID-19 vaccine program early in January. We have tested INO-4800 in various small animal models, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits and then we were able to show protection in non-human primates. </p>
<p class="p p2">We also started in the spring, Phase 1 clinical trials and first initially 40 healthy volunteers, 18 to 50. First subject was dosed in early April. In this clinical trial, we were able to show both neutralizing antibodies and T-cells. In fact, all 40 subjects were able to demonstrate either neutralizing antibodies or T-cell responses in this early Phase 1 clinical trials. </p>
<p class="p p2">We have submitted the paper through a peer review process and we are hopeful that that peer review process will complete and we can have a publication in the coming weeks. We were able to – as I mentioned, protect non-human primates from viral challenge of SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 release. </p>
<p class="p p2">Unlike other vaccines, which were challenged at the peak of their immune response, Inovio wanted to cut this in a more realistic setting where the immune responses were going through the memory state. So, we did this by waiting 17 weeks from the start of the vaccination or 13 weeks after the last vaccination at week four and we challenged the monkeys with the virus. </p>
<p class="p p2">And we were pleased to see that these non-human primates vaccinated with INO-4800 were protected with a faster clearance of the virus both in the lower lung, in the nasal passage and we were able to see strong neutralizing antibody and T-cell immune responses in these non-human primates, which were vaccinated with INO-4800 similar to what we saw in our Phase 1 clinical trials with INO-4800.</p>
<p class="p p2">So, what’s next? While we were waiting for the FDA clearance concurrence to start the Phase 2/3 trials in the U.S. in September and we are very confident that we will be able to do this with external funding. So, stay tuned for that. </p>
<p class="p p2">In addition to our completion of our Phase 1 trials in the U.S., we also have global trials, both in South Korea and in China that’s ongoing. So I am excited to share with you that the Chinese regulatory authorities have approved INO-4800 being tested in China. So the patient recruitment should be starting shortly in September. </p>
<p class="p p2">In addition, we have started earlier in the summer a trial conducted with our partner International Vaccine Institute in South Korea with funding from CEPI and that trial has begun enrolling earlier this summer. So, we have very diverse global trials going on, both here in the U.S., but also in South Korea, as well. </p>
<p class="p p2">And remember, we are waiting to start the Phase 2/3 efficacy trials later this month as we are very confident that we would do this with external funding. Speaking of external funding, Inovio has built a global coalition of funders, manufacturers, and collaborators, really highlighted by CEPI, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and The U.S. Department of Defense, collectively funded over $100 million in support of INO-4800 and our CELLECTRA device development. </p>
<p class="p p2">We are also pleased to say that we have been growing our global coalition of manufacturing partners in addition to our existing partner Ology and Richter-Helm, we are happy to present earlier this month that Thermo Fisher, a $160 billion corporation has partnered with Inovio to manufacture up to 100 million doses of INO-4800 in 2021 and perhaps even more in 2022 and beyond. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">So, we have very strong partnerships with these contract manufacturers to manufacture our vaccine, once we show that the vaccine is safe and efficacious through our clinical development, we will be able to concurrently manufacture these sources to supply globally. </p>
<p class="p p3">We also look forward to bringing in on additional manufacturers, both here in the U.S., Europe and other parts of Asia, so we would have truly a global manufacturing consortium. </p>
<p class="p p3">Next I’d like to touch on some of our other programs other than COVID-19 with expected important clinical data flow rest of 2020. The headlining that is our VGX-3100, which is our lead product currently in Phase 3 trials for cervical dysplasia caused by HPV infection. We also have Phase 3 trials ongoing for anal and vulvar dysplasia.</p>
<p class="p p3">And also as I mentioned, AstraZeneca is conducting multiple trials with MEDI 0457, which we have outlicensed to AZ several years back. So, we have a very extensive HPV therapeutics program. I am pleased to say that Inovio is on track to deliver top-line efficacy data from our REVEAL 1 Phase 3 global pivotal trial for VGX-3100 by fourth quarter in 2020, so before the year end. </p>
<p class="p p3">Currently, we have enrolled about 200 patients for this trial. Women with high-grade cervical dysplasia who have received three doses of VGX-3100. The primary endpoint is the regression of disease and clearance of the virus at week 36 and we are so much looking forward to sharing the data later this year of VGX-3100 REVEAL 1 data. </p>
<p class="p p3">As I mentioned, 3100 is also being tested for additional indications in Phase 2 trials. The first is vulvar dysplasia, second is anal dysplasia both of these indications are being tested in small Phase 2 trials. Earlier this year, we are able to report on interim data for both vulvar and anal dysplasia and we were very pleased and encouraged by the interim efficacy data that we have been seeing. </p>
<p class="p p3">For instance, in vulvar dysplasia, we are able to see 80% of the patients reported had decrease in lesions which was very exciting. 20% had complete response for this resolution of dysplasia and we also saw same 20% having the HPV virus 16 or 18 clearing. </p>
<p class="p p3">Similarly, for anal dysplasia, we saw 50% of the patients having their lesions, HPV-16 or 18 lesions clearing, very exciting. And 75% of the patients total also saw a decrease in number of lesions. So these are very exciting data. We also plan to report the full complete dataset from these two Phase 2 trials by the end of this year. So, we have lots of VGX-3100 data still coming in year 2020. </p>
<p class="p p3">Speaking of INO-3107, earlier this year, we received orphan designation against RRP. 3107 is positioned to be the first non-surgical immunotherapy for treating this horrible disease, Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis. We will be enrolling up to 63 adult patients and our goal is to expand the time in between the surgical procedures and we are very excited about this program INO-3107. So, please stay tuned. </p>
<p class="p p3">Moving on to our cancer program, really speaking about some of our very exciting immuno-oncology product is INO-5401. It’s a combination of three of our top cancer antigens delivered with interleukin-12 as our molecular immune modulator in combination with Regeneron’s PD-1 inhibitor. So, GBM being one of the most deadly cancers out there, we wanted to give these – we wanted to test INO-5401 in newly diagnosed GBM patients. </p>
<p class="p p3">So, we have recruited 52 newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients and I am very pleased to say that at 12 months from the start of our – receiving of our therapeutics, 52 patients, of the 52 patients, about 85% of them were alive at 12 months and these very encouraging and promising data was presented at a oral presentation of the – as a poster at the Virtual ASCO Meeting in late May this year. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">This was very encouraging because the historical value of OS-12 for these patients is about 65%. This was on top of the progression-free survival that was also very exciting which was at six months which was presented at last November at the SITC conference. So, what we are planning to do is, we are following these patients further and we plan to present overall survival at month 18 or OS18 at our Cancer Conference later this year in November. </p>
<p class="p p4">So, please be stay tuned for this very encouraging and exciting data in this very devastating cancer called GBM. </p>
<p class="p p4">So, lastly, I want to touch on our financials and our management team. Inovio is headed up by very seasoned veterans of biotechnology. Peter Kies, our CFO, Dr. Jacquie Shea, our COO and Dr. Laurent Humeau is our CSO and our Board of Directors are veterans of pharmaceutical industry and financial industry, as well. </p>
<p class="p p4">Last quarter, in June 30th report, we ended our cash position with almost $372 million. This is multiple years of cash runway. We currently also have about 168 million shares outstanding. And our milestone for rest of 2020 is very planful. As I mentioned, we expect to report on our REVEAL 1 Phase 3 top-line efficacy and safety data by the end of this year for VGX-3100. </p>
<p class="p p4">Also, before the end of this year, a full dataset for our Phase 2 VIN and AIN clinical trials. AstraZeneca will also report on MEDI 0457’s progress in head and neck cancer this year and we will continue to enroll and conduct our RRP therapeutic INO-3107. </p>
<p class="p p4">In cancer, we plan to report on OS18 at our Cancer Conference for INO-5401 and of course, we will have multiple milestones for INO-4800 including start of Phase 2/3 efficacy trials later in September and as I mentioned, we are very confident that we will have external funding to support this and also we will be advancing several other vaccine programs Lassa and MERS going on. </p>
<p class="p p4">So, lastly, I would like to summarize saying how wonderful Inovio is doing in advancing our programs, really advancing our DNA medicines platform including all of these products. </p>
<p class="p p4">So, I’d like to thank you for listening to our updates. And I look forward to fantastic 2020 and the rest of the year. Thank you. </p>
