<p class="p p1">Welcome to the NeoPhotonics Optical Communications Trends and Technologies webinar. This is our second Trends and Technology webinar, and today we will address important issues for Highest Speed Over Distance. This webinar is being webcast live on the Company’s website, at www.neophotonics.com, in the “Investors” section. This call is the property of NeoPhotonics and any recording, reproduction or transmission of this event without the express written consent of NeoPhotonics is prohibited. </p>
<p class="p p1">For more information on each of the various technology topics covered in this webinar, please refer to the Company’s blog at www.neophotonics.com/blog.</p>
<p class="p p1">I will now turn the call over to NeoPhotonics CEO, Tim Jenks. </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Tim Jenks</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning. Thank you for joining us. This webinar is being presented on Friday September 11. Today we remember the victims, families and heroes of this day, 19 years ago. Today we will talk about the Highest Speed Over Distance in optical networks. NeoPhotonics is a leading provider of tunable lasers and high speed components for high speed Cloud, data center and telecommunications. </p>
<p class="p p1">We keep people connected with high speed and highly reliable bandwidth for Cloud networks and for telecom interconnects, and we are now entering a New Era of Growth, as we will describe. </p>
<p class="p p1">This call has a webcast and such that illustrations from the webcast slides that will be helpful for listeners.</p>
<p class="p p1">I will pause briefly for you to review our Forward Looking Statements caution.</p>
<p class="p p1">In Fiber Optic Communications, NeoPhotonics is the leader in Coherent transmission for Highest Speed Over Distance for Cloud and telecom networks.</p>
<p class="p p1">Trailing revenues are approximately $400 million. High speed products are approximately 90% or more of our annual revenue. Accelerating high speed products have been leading our growth, as Q2 of 2020 growth was 26% over the same period last year. High speed coherent products are among the fastest growing areas in our industry. This is our sweet spot and is our topic today.</p>
<p class="p p1">We have several relevant articles to today’s topics on our blog at www.neophotonics.com/blog. These include relevant posts such as Importance of Power Efficiency in DCOs, by Marc Stiller; Transmitting 400Gbps Signals in 75 GHz Wide Channels, by Dr. Ferris Lipscomb; plus The Impact of Laser Linewidth and 1/f Frequency Noise on Coherent Optical Systems, by Dr. Winston Way.</p>
<p class="p p1">Demand for our high speed products is strong, notably for data rates from 400G to 800G. NeoPhotonics high speed optical solutions allow data centers, telecom carriers and enterprises to deliver the highest data rates over the longest distances. And as a result, these products are ramping with our leading customers. We expect that our products for 400G and higher data rates to be 20 to 25% of our 2020 revenue, and that may be as high as 40% of our revenue as we exit the year. Revenue from customers other than Huawei is expected to grow 40 to 50% over the next year. Excluding Huawei, our trailing one year revenues would be $219 million. Beyond the next year, we anticipate further acceleration in our growth as 400ZR modules deploy from mid-2021.</p>
<p class="p p1">We highlight customers beyond Huawei as BIS / Department of Commerce recently increased restrictions on Huawei for U.S. and foreign-produced items using U.S. technology. Assuming BIS restrictions remain in place beyond Q3 and, provided we are unable to obtain licenses, NeoPhotonics will not guide to any significant Huawei revenue. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">NeoPhotonics has been delivering coherent optical communications products since 2010. We push the boundaries of materials technology for optics, with vertical integration from design to wafer fab to product test and manufacturing. </p>
<p class="p p2">We led the first generation of 40G systems. In every subsequent speed node for the last decade, at 100G, 200G, 400G, 600G and now 800Gbps systems, we have offered a range of Coherent product solutions supporting the leading edge of performance and speed over distance.</p>
<p class="p p2">Our company has a deep culture of innovation and technology refinement. We have continued to advance our capabilities while making key acquisitions and integrating multi-national teams to constantly stay at the leading edge of performance in our products. This is our culture, with a relentless consistency of focus over years, in all things from manufacturing and process improvements with knowhow from fab to test, and with many trade secrets.</p>
<p class="p p2">As a company we provide the industry’s purest light tunable lasers, the highest data rate receivers and modulators, and the most reliable and complete hybrid integration technologies. This is enabling us to deliver the industry’s highest speed over distance and the highest capacity per channel or per fiber.</p>
<p class="p p2">NeoPhotonics sustainable competitive advantage begins with our laser as we leverage our uniquely low noise and ultra-pure light tunable lasers and an optical integration platform to deliver high performance. Our tunable lasers’ superior design provides the key attributes to deliver error-free signals at 400 Gbps and above at distance.</p>
<p class="p p2">Moreover, we continue to innovate, as evidenced by industry leading new laser products, such as our Nano tunable laser and our C++ LASERTM product for the highest capacity applications, both introduced last year.</p>
<p class="p p2">In our prior webinar on optical Trends and Technology, we discussed IP over DWDM as a network architecture to reduce cost per bit, and in which our laser technologies are essential. To deliver the highest capacity per channel or per fiber, NeoPhotonics’ uniquely ultra-low noise tunable lasers combine with modulators that deliver higher order modulation, high symbol rates and together deliver the widest spectrum in the industry, thereby expanding capacity and delivering clear and detectable error free signals at the highest data rates. This capability is the best in coherent optics technology.</p>
<p class="p p2">On today’s call I am joined by: Dr. Ferris Lipscomb, our Chief Marketing Officer, Dr. Winston Way, our Chief Technology Officer, and Beth Eby, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p class="p p2">Now I will turn the call over to Dr. Ferris Lipscomb to discuss how market forces are ushering a New Era of Growth for NeoPhotonics.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Dr. Ferris Lipscomb</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Thank you, Tim.</p>
<p class="p p2">In our last webinar we described the fundamental change with the advent of 400ZR pluggable transceivers, which seamlessly interoperate between routers in Data Center Interconnect and other edge and metro networks. In this webinar we will explore the parallel deployments of chassis-based systems that deliver 600G and 800G per wavelength data rates and operate over longer distances. Leveraging NeoPhotonics ultra- narrow linewidth tunable lasers and 64Gbaud and higher component solutions, these chassis-based systems are an additional major growth vector for us.</p>
<p class="p p2">Coherent transmission is the technology of choice for reaches ranging from 40 km for cloud and mobile backhaul through thousands of kilometers for telecom long haul. While the requirements of these segments are very different, each of them is forecast to grow rapidly. In fact, Coherent ports across all of these segments are forecast to grow at a five year compound annual growth rate of 80% through 2024. For the shorter ZR reach segments and driven by Cloud and edge applications, pluggable modules bring great simplification and cost reduction, but their applications may be constrained by the cooling available in their operating environment. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">For longer reaches from ultra-long haul of thousands of kilometers to regional and metro distances of several hundred kilometers, higher performance is needed than can be achieved in the coming generation of pluggable modules. For these applications chassis-based systems which can achieve higher channel bandwidths and longer reaches, but also are larger and consume significantly more electrical power. In between are some metro and regional systems that can be addressed by either 400ZR+ pluggable modules or by chassis-based systems. All of these segments will fuel our growth. And we believe that over time, the Cloud-driven pluggables will continue to drive network changes, advancements and new use cases.</p>
<p class="p p3">Shown on the left side is the new architecture for data center interconnect applications where coherent pluggable modules, such as NeoPhotonics 400ZR and 400ZR+ QSFP-DD, plug directly into a switch or router and connect to another data center up to 120 km away through an Open Line System. Shown on the right are the more traditional chassis-based systems which employ a separate “chassis” usually made by a Network Equipment Manufacturer, or NEM. These can utilize line-cards, transponder modules or so called stand-alone rack-mounted shelves, or “pizza-boxes”. This approach requires an additional level of network equipment, including four short reach transceivers per color to connect to the switch or router, which adds cost and power, but may be required for longer reach and higher performance.</p>
<p class="p p3">There are three separate network segments and three different network solutions, for which overlap is limited. The size of the colored boxes on this slide indicates the prevalence of that solution for the particular use case. </p>
<p class="p p3">For edge and DCI applications, most of deployments will be with interoperable 400ZR pluggable modules, indicated by the red color. These deployments will start next year and ramp in the second half. A smaller segment of these shorter applications will nonetheless require more performance than can be achieved with standard 400ZR modules. These will mostly be addressed by higher performance versions of the same pluggable modules, which are termed 400ZR+, indicated by the blue color. </p>
<p class="p p3">Now, 400ZR+ is less well defined than 400ZR and not yet as interoperable. However, the technology is still evolving, and will determine the ultimate performance. </p>
<p class="p p3">At the other end of the spectrum are long haul and ultra-long haul. These will mostly require the extra performance that can be achieved in chassis-based systems, indicated by the green color. These systems are mostly proprietary and utilize high performance coherent optical components made by NeoPhotonics. These optical components include our ultra-narrow linewidth tunable laser, our Coherent Driver Modulator, or CDM, and our high baud-rate coherent receiver. </p>
<p class="p p3">In the middle are metro and regional distances which will be addressed by a combination of 400ZR+ pluggable modules and chassis-based systems. The exact breakdown in each of these market segments will depend on the performance that can be achieved in 400ZR+ pluggable modules. I will show some market size estimates shortly, and Winston Way will discuss this further later in the presentation as well.</p>
<p class="p p3">For distances longer than ~40km or so, the deployment of bandwidth is measured in “coherent” optical ports, which provide transmission of 100 Gbps or more. Coherent ports frame the growth potential of our business.</p>
<p class="p p3">A coherent channel is comprised of these parts: An ultra-narrow linewidth laser, which drives both; a coherent modulator, and a coherent receiver. Each also encompasses Optical ICs such as electronic amplifiers and drivers.</p>
<p class="p p3">In addition, a digital signal processor (“DSP”) and other electronics are needed. This defines a “port”. It can be in a chassis-based system, or it can be a physical module – that is, a pluggable coherent transceiver. These products are smart – with software controls, systems virtually dial in appropriate settings for achieving the ‘right’ speed over distance. It’s dynamic – a continuum of baud rate and modulation combinations that adjust to maximize performance for a specific link.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">Huawei has averaged approximately 35% of the total world market for all coherent ports. The remainder of the market in ports, excluding Huawei, continues to grow at more than 20% per year.</p>
<p class="p p4">NeoPhotonics world leadership in ultra-pure light tunable lasers is key for these highest speed systems, as the lasers ultimately determine the achievable speed. For the highest speeds, substantially all of the industry leaders use our lasers. As a result, our product performance – and our production volumes today – place NeoPhotonics in a very strategic position as data rates increase. And for 400G and above systems, we have even higher market share.</p>
<p class="p p4">The highest speeds over distance are the market segments that are growing most rapidly. This segment includes 400ZR and 400ZR+ modules as well as 600G and 800G per wavelength chassis-based systems. On the left is NeoPhotonics’ estimate of the port growth for 400G and above. The red represents the ports for 400ZR, which focusses on the Data Center Interconnect market and other high capacity edge applications. The blue represents the higher performance segment of this market and includes both 400ZR+ as well as chassis-based systems that achieve 600G and 800G per wavelength capacity. </p>
<p class="p p4">Together, we believe, the port deployments of these highest speed over distance segments will grow at a 5 year CAGR of 80% from 2019 through 2024. NeoPhotonics serves the 400ZR and 400ZR+ markets by providing full solution pluggable coherent modules, such as our QSFP-DD and OSFP. We serve the chassis-based system market by providing high performance coherent components, including our ultra-narrow linewidth tunable lasers, or 64 and 96 Gbaud coherent driver modulators, or CDM, and our 64 and 96 Gbaud coherent receivers. </p>
<p class="p p4">These are two large, new growth markets for NeoPhotonics. In the graph on the right, the red bars represent our estimate of the TAM for 400ZR pluggable modules, while the blue bars represent the market for coherent components in chassis-based systems for 400G and above. </p>
<p class="p p4">Most 400G deployments have been in western countries, and we anticipate that port deployments will accelerate. We have highlighted that we expect 400G and above to be more than 20% of our 2020 revenue. In fact, we expect that in our Q4, on lower revenue, our 400G and above revenue will be above 40% of total revenue. And we currently expect that, of this, just over half will be for 600G and 800G systems. Moreover, with 40% of our revenue from these products as the market expands from $200 million to $1.3 billion in 2024, we are optimistic for our prospects for a New Era of Growth.</p>
<p class="p p4">We should acknowledge that there are several different “use cases” for high speed applications, moving to higher capacity and longer distances. As I noted, the two main parameters that can be adjusted to increase the capacity per wavelength in a coherent transmission channel are baud rate and modulation. </p>
<p class="p p4">Baud rate and modulation can be combined to achieve even higher capacities per channel, and these parameters can be controlled by software, making the adjustments dynamic! </p>
<p class="p p4">Of course these changes are not without trade-offs. Generally, increasing the modulation format reduces the distance that can be achieved, while increasing the baud rate improves distance reach but also requires increasing the channel spectral width effectively reducing the number of channels. </p>
<p class="p p4">NeoPhotonics serves the range of these applications and market segments. Shown in this table are the areas where NeoPhotonics has achieved design wins for components in chassis-based systems that operate at 400G, 600G and 800G. Our lasers are used by virtually all of the top NEMs for their highest speed applications. Our Modulators are used by 6 of 10 and our receivers are used by 7 of 10 top NEMs.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">As these customers are successful with deployments, they will be contributing to our acceleration in this New Era of Growth.</p>
<p class="p p5">With that, I would like to turn the discussion over to our Chief Technical Officer, Dr. Winston Way, who will describe the latest developments in ultra-high capacity optical fiber systems, and the reasons why our design win record is so strong.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Dr. Winston Way</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Thank you, Ferris. </p>
<p class="p p5">600G and 800G chassis-based systems use the highest performance optical components to achieve the highest speed over distance for the most demanding applications.</p>
<p class="p p5">As Ferris has described, there is a frontier of Speed and Distance – a broad set of dynamic possibilities. 600G and 800G is happening now, with field trials accelerating. This graph shows some of the trials and demonstrations for 600G and 800G chassis-based terrestrial transmission systems that have been announced. The blue dots are for 600G products and all of these products are somewhere between 64 and 70 Gbaud and are based on 16 nanometer DSPs. NeoPhotonics began shipping 64 Gbaud components in 2018. </p>
<p class="p p5">The red dots are for 800G announcements. These are based on products between 90-96 Gbaud and are 7 nm DSPs. NeoPhotonics began shipping 96 Gbaud components in 2019.</p>
<p class="p p5">The dashed blue line shows how 64 Gbaud systems can be dialed down in speed from 600G to 400G while the distance is increased from 200 km to 2000km. Similarly the dashed red line shows how 96 Gbaud systems can be dialed down from 800G to 400G while the distance is increased from 800 km to 4000 km.</p>
<p class="p p5">Comparing the blue and red lines, it is clear that using a higher baud rate helps to increase the transmission distance because the order of modulation is becoming smaller. In other words, using lower orders of modulation such as QPSK or 16 QAM instead of a very high order of modulation like 64 QAM increases the achievable distance. </p>
<p class="p p5">The yellow bar at the lower left shows the reach of 400 ZR+ with a pluggable module, based on a lower baud rate of 60 to 64 Gbaud. It covers metro and regional network markets of under about 1000km and is potentially a very large volume market. NeoPhotonics is shipping 400ZR and 400ZR+ module samples in 2020.</p>
<p class="p p5">In summary, from this slide we can see several trends: 1) 600G and 800G products can be used for long-haul 400G transmission. 2) The higher the baud rate, the longer the transmission distance. 3) The higher the capacity per wavelength, the shorter the transmission distance. Now I would now like to discuss how NeoPhotonics’ coherent technology is developed for different market needs.</p>
<p class="p p5">The systems shown at the top are current 600G and 800G systems based on sleds, or removable daughter cards, in a chassis. We can see three chassis products are composed of different numbers of 600G sleds, and one has 4 of 800G sleds. </p>
<p class="p p5">All of these chassis and sled-based systems target long haul and high capacity markets. Therefore, they require premium high bandwidth optical components such as those provided by NeoPhotonics. </p>
<p class="p p5">In contrast to these chassis-based products, in the lower portion of the slide we can see three types of pluggable transceivers, CFP2-DCO, DD-QSFP and OSFP. These are all 400G pluggable transceivers manufactured by NeoPhotonics with a target market with reaches up to about 1,000 km. Therefore, lower bandwidth optical components such as silicon photonic components have been used in these pluggable modules. </p>
<p class="p p5">We can see that these two categories of coherent transmission systems require either optical components with premium performance or low-power, low-cost pluggable modules.</p>
<p class="p p5">My focus today will be more on the components for the chassis-based systems in the top portion. </p>
<p class="p p5">Now I will go into more detail about the key components enabling these highest data rates.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">NeoPhotonics has three special component products that enable 600G and 800G transmission systems. 1) The first is an ultra-narrow linewidth tunable laser. What is shown here is our new Nano integrated tunable laser assembly, or abbreviated as Nano ITLA, featuring ultra-narrow linewidth. 2) Second is a high bandwidth coherent driver modulator, or HB-CDM. 3) Third is a high bandwidth intradyne coherent receiver, or HB-ICR. Both the coherent driver modulator and the receiver packages contain very sophisticated photonic integrated circuits with a multitude of high-performance optical elements, as depicted in the diagrams. </p>
<p class="p p6">What differentiates NeoPhotonics coherent components? The red-highlighted features on the left are the reasons that NeoPhotonics products are delivering the red-highlighted key performance benefits on the right to our customers:</p>
<p class="p p6">Ultra-narrow linewidth tunable laser. Because of its narrowest linewidth, lowest phase noise and higher optical output power result in longer distances and higher capacity, which is the main goal of these 600G and 800G products. </p>
<p class="p p6">Lower electrical power consumption enables higher port density. This means that a given chassis can support more high speed ports.</p>
<p class="p p6">Higher frequency accuracy and stability enables tighter packing of wavelengths in a fiber. This is key as it enables higher spectral efficiency and therefore higher fiber capacity.</p>
<p class="p p6">A wider tunable optical spectrum allows more wavelength channels to be transmitted through the fiber and consequently higher fiber capacity.</p>
<p class="p p6">For HB-CDM and HB-ICR, naturally higher bandwidth results in higher baud rates and higher capacity.</p>
<p class="p p6">Similarly, other features such as lower driving voltage, lower insertion loss, lower thermal noise, higher responsivity in these two components will present different system benefits to our customers as detailed in the slide. </p>
<p class="p p6">We will dig into each of these metrics and their implications over the next few slides. </p>
<p class="p p6">This is a technical slide, but the message is very simple. The difference is noise levels, shown as space between the blue line and black or pink line in the graph at the left, is the performance difference.</p>
<p class="p p6">What I am showing on the left is the phase noise for different lasers. The blue line at the bottom is for NeoPhotonics’ external cavity tunable laser <span class="ticker-hover-wrapper">(NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ECL" title="Ecolab Inc.">ECL</a>)</span>. The black and pink lines are from a competing type of laser called a Distributed Bragg Reflector tunable laser, or DBR laser. The ECL laser noise represented by blue line is significantly lower than that for a DBR laser across the spectrum, meaning lower phase noise in the left portion, and lower linewidth in the right portion of the spectrum.</p>
<p class="p p6">What is the impact of this lowest phase noise and linewidth on system performance? We can see in this graph on the right that there is a system penalty, called OSNR, when using a DBR laser relative to an ECL. For 800G this penalty is almost 2 dB at above 400 km, and for 600G the penalty is more than 2 dB at 400km. This is huge because a 2dB penalty corresponds to a 40% distance reduction! Most chassis-based systems which target longer distances will have even higher penalty. </p>
<p class="p p6">All these results have been published in a scientific journal earlier this year and are telling us that for 600G and 800G, it is essential to use a very narrow line width and low phase noise laser such as NeoPhotonics’ ECL tunable laser. This is why people love to use our lasers to cover not only the current but also the next-generation applications!</p>
<p class="p p6">There is another parameter which has recently become very important for tunable lasers, which is frequency stability and accuracy. This is a particularly important parameter for 600G and 800G.</p>
<p class="p p6">600G transmission uses a baud rate somewhere close to 70 GBaud. In order to increase the spectral efficiency and fiber capacity, it uses a 75 GHz-spaced DWDM array waveguide multiplexer and demultiplexer. With a 75 GHz channel spacing the stability and frequency accuracy of the laser becomes critical. By fitting a 70 Gbaud signal into a 75 GHz spacing is very tight, as shown. The diagrams compare today’s 100 GHz-spaced 100 Gbps wavelengths with 75 GHz-spaced 600 Gbps wavelengths on the right. We can see that not only the signal becomes fatter because the baud rate is increased from 32 to 70 Gbaud, which is more than doubled, but also the channel spacing is further reduced from 100 GHz to 75 GHz. This naturally causes much tighter channel spacing and therefore leaves little room for a laser to drift and generate interference to its neighbor channels. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">This is becoming even more so at 800G, because once you use 96 Gbaud data and to keep the total fiber capacity high it requires a channel spacing from 100 GHz to 125 GHz. Again, you can imagine by fitting this “fat” signal into such a narrow spacing, if the laser frequency accuracy and stability are not good, then the fat channel can easily generate crosstalk to its neighbor channels. </p>
<p class="p p7">NeoPhotonics’ tunable laser offers twice the frequency accuracy and stability of alternative tunable lasers and therefore enables these tighter channel spacings for the highest data rates.</p>
<p class="p p7">Another technical slide but again, a simple message of the high performance modulator used in HB-CDM and receiver used in HB-ICR.</p>
<p class="p p7">Two material systems, indium phosphide and silicon photonics, are commonly used for Coherent Modulators and receivers. Indium phosphide components have higher bandwidth than that of silicon photonics, and are used in 600G and 800G systems. Therefore, the chassis- and sled-based products that I have shown generally use these premium bandwidth components as opposed to silicon photonics, which is more suited to the distances for 400ZR modules. </p>
<p class="p p7">As shown in the table here, the indium phosphide modulator bandwidth at 600G is 40 GHz in comparison to silicon photonics’ 30 GHz. At 800G, our indium phosphide modulator can get to a bandwidth of 55 GHz, which is a lot higher than the typical 30GHz bandwidth of today’s silicon photonics modulator. </p>
<p class="p p7">Also shown in the table is the voltage required to drive the modulator on and off, called Vπ. The lower Vπ implies lower driving voltage and lower cost, and we can see that indium phosphide has about 3X lower Vπ compared to silicon photonics. </p>
<p class="p p7">Another key CDM parameter is the insertion loss. The combined insertion and coupling loss in a silicon photonics modulator is higher than that of an indium phosphide modulator. In addition, indium phosphide has the additional advantage of being capable of internal amplification to mitigate natural device loss. </p>
<p class="p p7">As for the coherent receiver, here we briefly compare the analog bandwidths of the two material systems. As shown in the table, for 600G products, the bandwidth of NeoPhotonics’ indium phosphide ICRs is around 40GHz, which is about 10GHz higher than that of a silicon photonics ICR. For 800G, our indium phosphide receivers can now achieve an astounding bandwidth of 60GHz, which is much higher than today’s 30 to 40 GHz bandwidth for a silicon photonics coherent receiver.</p>
<p class="p p7">Now I will move to Open Line Systems, which are important infrastructure products for 400ZR, 400ZR+ and 600G to 800G transport systems. These products get the optical signals on and off of the fiber and manage them through their journey to their ultimate destination.</p>
<p class="p p7">To remind you, in our last webinar we showed that transmission by pluggable coherent transceiver modules at 400Gbps for distances of up to above 100 kilometers is now real, and they can be directly plugged into switches and routers, in an “IP over DWDM” architecture. This is a “sea change” where DCI connections become far simpler and cost per bit reduces by 75% or more by eliminating two network equipment boxes, and numerous short-reach transceivers. This puts the long distance transmission capability of a line card into a pluggable transceiver. I will further elaborate the equipment saving in the following slide. I believe that over the next few years, this IP over DWDM architecture will become the mainstay of new installations for DCI. For longer distances the higher performance of chassis-based systems will still be required. Both of these paths represent major growth vectors for NeoPhotonics.</p>
<p class="p p7">Before I talk about our open line system products, I would like to first elaborate more on the equipment used in a traditional telecom network. As you can see here, besides routers in each central office, we need expensive DWDM transport equipment and complex reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexers, or ROADMS. Optical signals can travel through multiple nodes and be routed on a wavelength basis to different destinations. This is very flexible, but also very costly.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">In contrast, the network in the lower half shows a simplified architecture where optical signals just go from one router to another by passing through a passive and low-cost DWDM mux and demux and optical amplifiers. By passive mux and demux, I mean you don’t even need to power them up. All switching and routing is done at the electronic level. The optical system is thus simplified and with new coherent transceivers that plug directly into routers, the distance factor is almost removed from the network. When comparing the upper and lower diagrams, we can see that the use of IP over DWDM now can eliminate two very expensive equipment sets: the DWDM transport gear and the ROADM, and consequently the cost savings is huge!</p>
<p class="p p8">NeoPhotonics is a key designer and manufacturer of the multiplexers and demultiplexers that place the optical wavelengths onto the fiber and extract them as well.</p>
<p class="p p8">NeoPhotonics designs and manufactures special mux demux filters that are optimized for 400G, 600G and 800G signals. As shown in the table here, 400ZR and 600G transmission typically uses 75 GHz channel spacings, while 800G uses 100GHz to 125 GHz, and 1.2 Tbps will use 150 GHz channel spacing. Each of these multiplexers and de-multiplexers also has a passband and channel numbers specially designed for the type of signal to be transported.</p>
<p class="p p8">NeoPhotonics filters also increase the spectral region to cover different “bands” in the fiber, such as the C, L and C++ bands to maximize the total fiber capacity for each operational node. I’ll show that in the next slide.</p>
<p class="p p8">NeoPhotonics’ Line System multiplexers and demultiplexers, as well as our high bandwidth components, cover the C, C++ and the L-Band. The bandwidth provided the conventional C-Band is about 4 to 4.8 THz. Our components can also cover the C++ Band, which has a 6 THz total bandwidth and therefore increases bandwidth by 25 to 50%. We have lasers, CDMs and ICRs to cover the widest spectral region, including both C-Band and L-Band, doubling the capacity of a traditional transmission system. Therefore, our customers can choose the best combination to increase the capacity of their transmission link. At the highest speeds, this leads to a total capacity approaching 80 Terabits per second on one fiber, the highest in the industry for commercial products.</p>
<p class="p p8">In summary, the trends and technology paths are clear. 400G+ is the fastest growing segment for both Cloud and telecom networks. In 2021 to 2023, cloud and telecom networks both need 400ZR and 400ZR+ pluggable modules and also 600 to 800G chassis-based transport systems. We are driving this high speed and high growth segment for both and we are well positioned for this New Era of Growth. Our roadmap to 96 Gbaud and above will usher in the over 1 Terabit generation.</p>
<p class="p p8">We also enable critical Optical Line Systems that connect 400G and above transceivers with our Networks Products and Solutions.</p>
<p class="p p8">400G+ solutions are deploying now and serve the longest reach and “biggest” data pipes.</p>
<p class="p p8">With that, let’s go to Beth Eby, our Chief Financial Officer, for a financial summary.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Beth Eby</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thank you, Winston.</p>
<p class="p p8">As you all know, for the last few years, we have been focused on cash, cash flow and profitability. We have consistently improved across these metrics for the last 2 years.</p>
<p class="p p8">Looking at our trailing 12 month data for each quarter for the last 3 years, you can see that we have raised margins by 9 points and were operating profit positive, steadily increased cash flow. We increased cash and paid down debt. All of this while maintaining the R&amp;D necessary to deliver great new products.</p>
<p class="p p8">We have the execution and resources in place to be able to meet the challenges of taking on a new set of demanding customers. This remains true, regardless of shipment levels to Huawei.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9">As we said in our call on August 31, on August 17, 2020 the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, clarified the restrictions placed on Huawei Technologies to include all direct product, not just direct product designed by Huawei, that is designed or made with U.S. equipment or software. </p>
<p class="p p9">There is a grace period that allows us to ship until September 14th. As a result, we have reaffirmed our outlook for Q3. This grace period also gives us the time to analyze our product flows and work with our suppliers to determine what we can ship going forward. This analysis is still ongoing. As a measure of caution, as we said on August 31, we will manage our business without relying on contributions from Huawei. </p>
<p class="p p9">Scoping the impact of this, in the longer term, we would expect to see market share shift to other leading players in the industry, who are also our customers. As the overall demand profile for high speed data transmission remains strong, so it will just be a question of who is supplying that demand. And as Tim said, we expect to see 40 to 50% year-over-year growth from our non-Huawei customers, which will be good revenue growth and will allow a return to profitability by the end of 2021. </p>
<p class="p p9">Until that time, we are working to reset our business to that lower revenue level, while still maintaining the investment in the 400G modules and high speed components that will drive our growth in the future. Fortunately, we have the financial resources and a resilient management team with a track record of delivering through volatility.</p>
<p class="p p9">Our outlook for Q3’20 remains the same. </p>
<p class="p p9">As I mentioned, the update of the Entities List rules does not materially change the outlook, as there is a grace period for products in production to ship until September 14th.</p>
<p class="p p9">As many of you know, our operating model is gross margin at 35%, with operating expenses at 25% of revenue for a 10% operating profit. Over the last year, we have come very close to that model, and we expect to return rapidly to that point. </p>
<p class="p p9">What you will see, in terms of puts and takes while we drive back to profitability is: 1) Within gross margin, for transparency, I will continue to break out product margin and the charges related to underutilization of our factories. Without Huawei volumes, we expect product margins to increase slightly, as product mix improves. To reduce underutilization charges, we will insource and reset to a lower capacity level. But near term, the lower leverage on our factories will increase underutilization charges substantially. 2) We will reduce operating expenses, as we did in 2019. Within that, we will maintain investment in the latest technologies that are our growth drivers.</p>
<p class="p p9">We have shared our view on the new growth markets we are pursuing, and the exciting products we have launched, that leverage our high performance and high speed coherent suite. </p>
<p class="p p9">Our ultra-narrow linewidth lasers, silicon photonics and indium phosphide platforms, plus our other high speed and high volume components give us a strong position to serve the most critical needs of our customers and compete effectively for this New Era of Growth.</p>
<p class="p p9">To support these ambitions, we continue to pursue profitable operations, expanding margins, and generating positive cash flow for a strong balance sheet.</p>
<p class="p p9">We hope this has been a helpful presentation on the trends we see and our technology core and we will now open up the call for questions.</p>
