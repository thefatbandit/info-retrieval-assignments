<p class="p p1"><strong>Jessica Reif Cohen</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good afternoon, everybody and welcome back. We could not be more thrilled to have Christine McCarthy here with us today representing Disney Company. Chris is the CFO and Senior EVP of The Walt Disney Company. </p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Jessica Reif Cohen</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">So, Christine, this has been quite a year for Disney so far. You closed on your acquisition of 20th Century Fox, I guess, year-and-a-half ago. And since then, you've assumed full operational control – not financial, but full operational control of Hulu. You've launched Disney+, undergone a reorganization of the company management, of your senior management, become a major competitor of online streaming. You have over 100 million direct to consumer paid subs. Of course, your trio of services. But at the same time, you faced a number of significant COVID-related headwinds, needless to say, including the complete shutdown of the theme parks, complete shutdown of production activity and retail. Can you give us an update on how COVID is impacting your businesses today? What's changed since Disney reported earnings in August? </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Well, I like to say there's never a dull moment in our Magic Kingdom. But seriously, COVID has really thrown a wrench into a lot of our businesses. And as you mentioned, parks had to close, cruise ships stopped sailing, productions ceased, live sports weren't continuing. So, there were no live sports on ESPN. So, we really did have quite an impact and felt it very, very early on in the COVID world that we're living in now. </p>
<p class="p p1">We're also – I'd say one thing is different. Not different, but I think it's just put a real spotlight on it, is that management has to be nimble and it has to be flexible, and it has to look at new ways of doing things that we did in the past a certain way. And I think the flexibility is key. And we continue to do that as we look at restarting some of our businesses and just adjusting the way we're doing business. </p>
<p class="p p1">But just a couple of examples. As you know, parks was – all the parks were closed globally. And now, they have begun opening up. So, we have had to implement a lot of social distancing, a lot of precautionary measures for health and safety. We have done those, I would say, very well in the parks that are open. They're not all open. But that will continue. And we continue to work with governments and state, local, county, national governments, especially overseas, on how we are looking at that business resuming full tilt. </p>
<p class="p p1">One of the businesses that I just want to mention is probably the last to come back for us will be the cruise business and that has to do with just the nature of cruising. And when we do get back in there, we'll be social distancing, whatever is required at that time, but also the booking period for cruise tends to be longer. So, that's probably the one that will be the last business to resume for us. </p>
<p class="p p1">Our legacy media businesses, the one thing that I would say COVID has had an impact on is we saw and have seen, as we all know, in the media business, a decline in the subscriber base from traditional multichannel ecosystem. And what we saw post COVID was an acceleration of the decline. And we don't yet know if the acceleration was due to COVID or if that will basically revert to the way it was prior to COVID. So, that could be just a secular trend that will continue. But that's another impact that COVID has basically put on our watch list more intensely than before. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">As you know, direct to consumer is something that Bob Iger really focused on for many years, really starting back in 2015 when I first started as CFO. And we really looked at the changing universe of the way consumers consume media. And we were one of the early movers in addressing those concerns and the subscriber declines. And Bob Chapek has continued with that, our direct to consumer emphasis. </p>
<p class="p p2">And one of the things we've done with our direct-to-consumer businesses have adjusted even what we had intended to do, specifically on Disney+, and that is that we've moved up the SVOD window for some of our movies. So, you saw Frozen and Onward and the Rise of Skywalker come on the service earlier than what they would have necessarily under the old paradigms. </p>
<p class="p p2">We also added some incremental content, things like Hamilton and Beyonce's Black is King. And we also moved some selected titles from the film studio to go direct to Disney+, things like Artemis Fowl, The One and Only Ivan. And, of course, you've seen what we recently did, having premier access for viewing Mulan. And we believe that that was the right thing to do given the COVID environment that we're currently operating in. </p>
<p class="p p2">So, we'll continue to adjust our strategies, Jessica, as we as we need to. But once again, flexibility and being nimble is key. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">So we'll get into each one of your divisions, of course, in detail. But outside of the near-term COVID disruption and the march back to normalization, have your key strategies and financial priorities over the next three to five years changed at all?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">I would say no, with the exception of we're looking at more investment in direct to consumer because we have announced that we are accelerating our launches and are going deeper faster. But in general, we're still investing in our businesses the way we have. We're investing – we'll continue to invest in theme parks. We believe that those investments globally have really driven strong returns on capital for us. And you know that business, how well it's performed, not in the COVID world, but for the last several years. That business performed extremely well in terms of not only revenue growth, but operating income growth and improved margins. So, we'll continue to invest there. And then, we'll continue to invest in the direct to consumer initiatives because they're working out so well for us right now. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">So, let's go through the divisions because there's a lot to talk about. So, as you said, this is just unprecedented having the park shut down, but you have a number of parks up now in Shanghai, Paris, Tokyo, Orlando. COVID cases have gone down finally in Florida. Are you seeing the change in consumer behavior there?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, the consumer behavior that we looked at, we do a lot of surveying ourselves as well as we look at the other consumer research done on habits and consumer behavior what people did before COVID, what they intend to do as they would now when we don't live in a world with a vaccine, an effective vaccine, and what the intent to do things like go to a theme park, go to a movie theater, go to restaurants. </p>
<p class="p p2">So, in Florida, we're not going to update more than we did on the earnings call in early August. But we have seen – we're opening up and people are coming. As we mentioned, there was a spike in July in in Florida, and that had an impact on the visitation that we had expected because people couldn't – didn't choose to necessarily travel to Florida. So, what we did was we shifted to more local visitation as well as opening it up more fully to annual pass holders. </p>
<p class="p p2">So, we continue to once again adjust the business depending on what issues we're dealing with. And once again, this is such an unpredictable virus that we have to stay flexible. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And how is the reopening of hotels, the Disney hotels progressing in Orlando? </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, we're really looking at maximizing – really utilizing that yield strategy. So, we're not going to be opening up things if we don't have sufficient demand. But by the end of this fiscal year, we expect to have a little over 50% of our hotels, resorts opened, and that also includes hotels, DVCs that are being utilized currently with the NBA for housing, the NBA for operating in the bubble down in Orlando. </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And when do you expect the three new cruise ships that were originally scheduled for 2021 through 2023 to be delivered?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, the cruise ships, COVID has had an impact on lots and lots of businesses and lots and lots of supply chains. And the shipyard we utilize for our cruise ships, Meyer Werft, was impacted and we encountered a delay. We're in negotiations, in discussions with the shipyard to finalize dates. But as soon as we have those, we'll make an announcement when we have the fifth ship, which is the first of the three to be delivered. But it is delayed from what we had originally anticipated.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Of course. And probably – as you said, it's going to be the last business to come back. You lowered your CapEx guidance for fiscal 2020 to roughly $1.2 billion, and it's largely due to lower spending at the theme parks and resorts. When we think about the next three years, have your investment plans for new rides and attractions meaningfully changed? </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, what we've done, Jessica, is we've really prioritized some of our investment spending. Things that were, I call it, in flight, but they were in construction, some of those we continue to put to finish out even during this period, but the ones that we're really focused on are things like the Star Wars hotel that we've discussed publicly that will be in Walt Disney World. That's a priority. Completion of the Avengers Campus in Disneyland, as well as Mickey &amp; Minnie's Runaway Railway, which is also – it's a priority project for Disneyland. There's one in Florida that recently opened just before COVID hit, and it's been very, very well received. </p>
<p class="p p3">The interesting thing is Mickey &amp; Minnie's Runaway Rail is the first Mickey attraction that has been in a park. When you think about Mickey's all around the place, by having a designated attraction, this is the first one. And it's once again, for true Disney fans, they like it very much. </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Let's move on to direct-to-consumer because we still have a lot of a lot of businesses to cover. As we said earlier, you've achieved a groundbreaking milestone of 100 million direct-to-consumer paid subscriptions. And Disney+ alone surpassed 60 million in less than a year. It was just astounding really how quickly you've grown. So, what led to the strong performance relative to your maybe not internal expectations, but your public expectations? And based on the acceleration, how are you thinking about DTC subs, how are you thinking about breakeven? </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So, I think it's fair to say that we are thrilled with the way Disney+ was received and adopted by many consumers and the number of subscriptions that we had, but that result that we achieved early on and continue to grow subscribers, that exceeded our expectations too. We weren't sandbagging. We weren't sandbagging and just intended to blow away the guidance that we had provided. </p>
<p class="p p3">But I think it really speaks to what Disney is really known for. And it's really known for quality content. It's known for its brands, its franchising and great storytelling. Now, we had planned to do – and once again, COVID threw a wrench in this, but we had a lot of really great content that was queued up to be produced and have a nice cadence as it was put onto the service. And that has slowed a bit because we haven't been able to do a lot of those productions. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">But what it shows is that – but we have a big library too. And the library, a lot of people haven't seen a lot of content for years and years and years. And we do have some new content. And we are – one thing I think people certainly loved at the beginning when we first launched Disney+ was Mandalorian. And we just announced recently that Mandalorian 2 will be available at the end of October on Disney+. </p>
<p class="p p4">So, we're still able to do some things and finish them out. But once again, we will continue to invest in content for the service because it's a combination of this great rich library that we have, but also being able to provide new original content. </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">What have you seen so far in regard to churn on Disney+? And then, I guess, besides that – what have you seen in regards to churn? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Well, churn is inevitable. We watch it – now one of the nice things that we have that we have not been able to avail ourselves before we went and had these direct-to-consumer relationships is we have a lot of data. We have a lot of data on how people are consuming, when they consume. We know if someone is churning. Is it because they just don't use it. But the churn that we have experienced is in the range of what we had expected. And we're pretty pleased. And we know that there are certain things that we're going to focus on to try to mitigate some of the churn. And a lot of that will have to do with some of the new programming that we'll be focused on and really targeting to keep some consumers and some subscribers who may have been more likely to churn. But once again, having that data is really, really critical because once you have it, you can sort of address the concerns and really fulfill the needs to keep a subscriber on the service. </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Absolutely. But how much more investment are you planning to contribute or invest in the next few years based on early indications of customer lifetime value? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Well, I think we're not going to update that now. We will give an updated number at our Investor Day for what the investment spending will be. But we're committed to having programming that's going to be produced across our content engines and our content productions, entities that will fulfill basically the needs of our subscribers or the desires of our subscribers. So, we're not going to update that investment number now, Jessica, but we will be giving more guidance on that in the upcoming Investor Day. </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">How much traction are you seeing for Disney+ in major markets where you recently launched, markets like India, parts of Western Europe and Japan? These are markets where you have the huge consumer following, like a real affinity to Disney brands. And Japan of all markets, I was thinking – it is one of the highest, like, Disney, I don't know, [indiscernible]. Just an affinity for, I guess, [indiscernible]. Once you fully roll out the service, will it be bundled with other telcos besides NTT DoCoMo?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">In Japan, well, Japan is an interesting case. So, we did a limited launch in Japan, which was through NTT DoCoMo, and we still have it on our launch roadmap for doing a full launch outside of just NTT DoCoMo. </p>
<p class="p p4">And you're right, Japan – the Japanese culture, Disney resonates extremely well. Whatever it taps into in that culture, the classic characters, just the Disney folklore, it really does resonate well. But that we will continue. </p>
<p class="p p4">But in general, when you ask about our international launches, I think it's fair to say that we have been – all of the launches have exceeded our expectations, just like the US exceeded expectations. Once again, the US is such a large market. And we're based here and everybody knows Disney if you're living in the US. But of all of the international launches have exceeded expectations thus far. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And then, what can you say about the upcoming launch of the Star brands, the fuller version now being called Star in international markets? You said you're going to launch in 2021. Will you launch in all of the same markets as Disney+ and can you talk about the plans for pricing or potentially bundling the service? </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, we're in the process of refining the launch plans and the investment spending, and we will once again at the Investor Day provide a full roadmap for how that is going to be rolled out in the international markets. </p>
<p class="p p5">But Star will look different in some of the markets. It's not going to be a one size fits all. It's really going to be based on the dynamics of each individual market. And I wouldn't say – there's not going to be, like, every market will be different, but there'll be a couple of different versions of Star. And we intend to have that be a general entertainment. Once again, we'll get more specific at the Investor Day along with how we're going to roll it out. But we do think there's a lot of synergy in the markets that we have already launched Disney+. So, we think there's some good synergistic value that we'll be able to basically get behind.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">One more on DTC and then I'll move on to another division. How do you think about pricing for your DTC services in general? How much pricing do you believe Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ – how much purchasing power do you think that they have? And when does it make sense to raise prices? How do you think about it as a company?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">It's clear that we priced Disney+ at a very accessible price point initially. There is pricing power we believe, but that will come as put more original content into the services. So, more content, more just the volume of content. Once again, we've said we're doing it and we had plans and there would have been a lot more original content on now if we had not been shut down for COVID production – I mean, productions shut down for COVID. But when more content is on the service, we'll have some pricing power. And once again, it's not necessarily every market would be done the same way. We're going to also adjust it for market dynamics in these various markets, especially outside of the US. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Let's move on to the studios. Now that the majority of theaters are finally open, maybe not open here in New York, but most theaters are open. And the first major box office film, Tenet, has finally been released. What is your outlook for the remainder of the year and 2021 in terms of your film slate? Obviously, some of the movies have been moved direct to Disney+? What can you tell us? What's changed? </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Some movies have moved to Disney+. And once again, when all the movie theaters were shut, we made the decision to move a couple, Artemis Fowl and The One and Only Ivan specifically. And as I mentioned before, we did move up the SVOD window to accommodate an earlier placement of Frozen 2, Onward and The Rise of Skywalker. </p>
<p class="p p5">But when you look at the studio, 68% of the country is open. Now what's missing there are some big major markets. California. So, you're missing the big Los Angeles market, you're missing San Francisco, you're also missing some big markets in the northeast, particularly the New York area. </p>
<p class="p p5">So, when we look at that, when you only have, call it, two-thirds of the country's theaters open and you have consumer behavior – and when we have looked at the consumer behavior, there's probably about 40% that people say they will go into a theater to watch a movie, but you have to look at the demographics that some of our movies appeal to. And especially, the family movies, I don't believe it's 40% for people with young children. It's probably not 40% for older people or baby boomers, some of whom have a very, very strong Disney affinity. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">So, I think you have to look at what demographic are we targeting and does it make sense for us to do theatrical releases? Or would we do something that is kind of a hybrid, but we look at these on an individual basis. And once again, it's not one size fits all. We're dealing in a world that it changes more frequently than we would like because you do have these surges of infection rate across the country and across the world that it's not steady state. And so, we'll once again look at our release slate, but we do have a pretty robust release slate scheduled upcoming. </p>
<p class="p p6">We've got for the holiday season, this year, this calendar year, we have Death on the Nile, we've got Black Widow, just looking at my release slate here. We've got Soul, Free Guy and West Side Story, which I'm really excited to see West Side Story. It's looks fabulous to me. </p>
<p class="p p6">And in 2021, we have also some high profile titles, things like the Eternals from Marvel and the Kingsman. Both of those are slated at this point. But once again, things can change. They're slated to come out in February. And then, we have Raya and the Dragon. That's an animated film in March. And Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Cruella in May. And then, we also have Luca, which is a Pixar film that's slated for June. </p>
<p class="p p6">So, we've got a pretty robust slate. And once again, we hope that the theaters are open. A lot of our films are films that that the people who choose to go to movie theaters, the experience is very different than what they would have at home. </p>
<p class="p p6">So, when you look at our box office numbers over the last couple of years, we drive a lot of people into theaters to see the Disney films. These tentpole films become kind of part of the zeitgeist of culture, whether it's Marvel, whether it's a Black Panther that was a couple of years ago, but these are movies that people like to see in theaters and talk to their friends about. So, once again, we hope the theaters stay healthy and can rebound from this COVID world we're living in now. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">I have to say that even I might be tempted to go to theater for West Side Story. That's an amazing one. </p>
<p class="p p6">You elected to release Mulan through a peep out approach at $29.99 price point. It's a pretty healthy price point for Disney+ subscribers few days ago, September 4, and also select theaters internationally. It's such an interesting strategy. It's so interesting to me. Can you tell us what impact this offering has had on incremental subscriber signups to Disney+?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">It has had some, but that was not the primary reason that we chose to release it this way. We chose to release it this way because the release date, as some people who were following just what was going on with theaters not opening and just shift, shift, shift. We had moved the release date several times. And we believed that that movie – given that there's so little new content out, that movie was done and we wanted to get it out in the public domain. And so, we chose to do it this way because we believed that it was the best way to get to most people for them to enjoy it. </p>
<p class="p p6">Now, if they already had a Disney+ subscription, they could just purchase the movie. Or if they wanted it, they would have to sign up for a subscription. But that was an additional benefit, I would say. It was not the primary driver. We thought that we could drive the most revenue for us doing it this way. And we did have what we believed was a very – we're pleased with the results that we had over the Labor Day weekend, the four day weekend. </p>
<p class="p p6">But we're learning a lot through this. It's first time we've ever done one of these. And once again, we're taking the opportunity of COVID to do things we've never done before. And we're taking the opportunity to see if there's better ways of doing things than we had previously done. But once again, it's not something that we're – you shouldn't read anything into what we did with Mulan. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And in the markets that don't have Disney+, some of the international markets, you will go into theaters. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And that includes markets such as China. There's been some sort of controversy this week over Mulan. Do you expect that to have an impact on performance?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I don't want to – I'm not a box office predictor, prognosticator. But I will say that it has generated a lot of publicity, let's call it, let's leave it at that. </p>
<p class="p p7">But let me just put something into context. The fact that Mulan – the real issue – the real facts of Mulan is Milan was primarily shot in – almost the entirety in New Zealand. And in an effort to accurately depict some of the unique landscape and geography of the country of China for this historically – period piece drama, we filmed scenery in 20 different locations in China. </p>
<p class="p p7">Now, it's common knowledge that, in order to film in China, you have to go be granted permission. And that permission comes from the central government's – I think it's called publicity department or something like that. And it's also common knowledge in the film industry that – it's a practice that is done throughout the world to acknowledge in a film's credits where – you acknowledge in the film's credits the national and local governments that allowed you to film there. And so, in our credits, that was – it recognized both China as well as locations in New Zealand. And I would just leave it at that. But that's generated a lot of issues for us. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">One last question on films and we have to move on to media networks and so much more to cover with you? As we discussed earlier, many of the films – many of the Disney films were fast tracked onto Disney+ because of COVID. But what are your thoughts on the windows – changing windows? Will we move closer to day and date? We know that Universal made a deal with AMC for 17 days. What is the Disney view? </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">As I said before, we think the movie going experience to view a lot of our films, the tentpole films works very well for consumers to see our movies. That doesn't mean that other mediums aren't or other platforms aren't useful as well. But we think just the grandeur, the scale of some of our large tentpole films, we like it when people can see it in a theater. So we're not narrowing in on anything specific day and date, going to PVOD, or not going to PVOD. And we look at the array of films that we have now, especially with the addition of some of the smaller films that we have coming out of Searchlight which we acquired. with Fox. You have to look at those different films and some of them may be perfectly suited for going into a PVOD or going directly into one of the platforms, Disney+ or Hulu, or some of them will choose to release initially in the theatrical market. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So, let's talk about the media networks. As you said, it's been basically a precipitous decline since COVID of pay TV universe. Now that major sports have returned, have you seen any change in sub rates in ESPN particularly? Is there any insight that you can give us into the trajectory for affiliate growth and pricing over the next few years? </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, we're not going to update affiliate – the sub numbers. But as you also know, and I think this is worth mentioning on this call, is that we get numbers with a 60-day delay. So, what the distributors give us is two months in arrears. So, the distributors have more up to date information than we do. </p>
<p class="p p7">That being said, I think the return of live sports has been embraced. We've got some great games for the NBA Playoffs and we have football returning. We have college football, we have three of the five power conferences that we'll be playing or intend to play. So, there's a lot of good sports that people are watching. Also baseball's back. Now, baseball, it has had some stutter steps just depending on the rate of infections for some of the teams, but some of the baseball games are great. And people are watching baseball. So, the return of live sports has definitely been something that I think the viewing public has embraced. </p>

<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">You took a $5 billion impairment charge at the international channels business in the fiscal third quarter, and you closed down within 20 channels in APAC and India. Now, what do you see across the globe in regards to pay TV trends relative to streaming trends? And how are you repositioning your international business to stay on top of the changes that are taking place? </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">That's a great question. And I spoke about it on our earnings call. And I'll just remind everyone what I said is, COVID had a global impact. So, COVID had an impact on the performance of those international channels. Also, we're seeing the same behavior. It started a little bit later, but it's still the same behavior of a decline in the subscriber base globally. And we looked at those two things in combination with our plans and our intent to move more quickly into direct-to-consumer internationally. And we looked at that and we have shut down, as you mentioned, over 20 channels, and one of the ones that we've talked about publicly and it's probably the one that people would focus on is we shut down the Disney Channel in the UK. And one of the reasons is because all of our Disney content for the Disney Channel, you can get exclusively on Disney+ in the UK. </p>
<p class="p p8">So, all of those things, when you combine, a change in strategy, the market dynamics, and then this world of COVID that's really impacted the business, we decided that – we didn't decide. We went through a very rigorous process of looking through the analysis and whether or not we – whether this business was worth what we had on our books for and that's why we took that impairment. </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Can you provide any update on this incredibly unusual 2020 upfront market and what do you see in the scatter market? </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yeah, well, this is certainly an unusual time for the advertising market. A couple things have changed. One is, the upfront shows were all virtual this year, I was quite impressed. I didn't watch all of them, but I did watch ours. And I thought the advertising team working with the content teams did a great job putting that all together. </p>
<p class="p p8">But the negotiation window usually kicks off in May and June, right after the upfronts. This one really didn't get going until July, and it's probably going to go through all the way through to September. So, that's just a delay. </p>
<p class="p p8">Then you have what – I will give you the overall market forecast for volume in the upfront, was anticipated to be down about 20%. That's a pretty big hit to the overall volume in the marketplace. But I will tell you that we anticipate performing far better than that 5% down. </p>
<p class="p p8">And there's also another dynamic, which was the continuation of a trend, is that we've seen really good traction in digital and addressable advertising demand. So, that's been very important. </p>
<p class="p p8">And the other thing I would say is, while pricing is really important to many of our advertising clients, so is flexibility, especially in this current environment, and we have worked with them on flexibility. And we believe that that has helped us out in our results that we're – pretty much, we're going to close it out. And I think we're definitely going to feel good about where we land, given the market that we're dealing with.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">And scatter, what are you seeing in the current scatter market? </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So, currently, we're in our fourth quarter because we're September 30 year-end. So, both scatter demand and scatter pricing this quarter are better than the third quarter that we just reported. And also, you're seeing – even though it's not as good as last year, there's no question about that, but it's this quarter is better than Q3. And we're also seeing that CPMs are better than third quarter as well. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9">So, the trends are improving, at least for us, quarter to quarter. And once again, we feel good about where we are given this tough, tough environment that we're operating in.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">I have two more essential questions, even though we're running out of time, so I’ll just try to do quickly. How are your negotiations with the NFL progressing? You have actually been unusually open as a company, usually pretty closed mouth. But this has been pretty open about a desire to get NFL back on ABC. How are you thinking about the rates for Monday night football and potentially getting more aggressive with some of the other packages?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Well, I'm not going to get into specifics. But let me just say that the NFL is an extremely important partner for us. We've been in business with them for a long, long time. If we believe a deal that delivers the economic value that we believe it delivers long term value to our shareholders, we would be more than happy to do that kind of a deal with the NFL. And we approach all of these negotiations in a very, very disciplined manner. And we remain interested in deals that, once again, create shareholder value, and I'll just leave it at that. </p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Jessica Reif Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Then last question, sadly, because we're out of time, after multiple debt raises since COVID began at very favorable interest rates, I will say, and suspension of your dividends in the first half of fiscal year 2020, you've maintained a really strong balance sheet. You've got $23 billion in cash on hand. Do you need such a big cash cushion? And how are you thinking about the reinstatement of dividends? And what your capital allocation priorities are for fiscal 2021? We're essentially in fiscal 2021. </p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">We've addressed that cash position. So when COVID hit, it hit us hard. We're not making any bones about that. And we know that liquidity is essential to the functioning of a company. And we didn't have any idea how long this was going to go. So, once again, you could say we're conservative or prudent when it comes to managing liquidity or a balance sheet. We took the opportunity to raise in two large debt issuances, one in March and one in April, significant monies at very, very attractive rates. And we were also able to use that long-term debt and exit reliance on the commercial paper market. Once again, just not knowing how stable the commercial paper market was going to be. We just decided to – so we could all sleep at night and not have to worry about liquidity do this. </p>
<p class="p p9">Now, where we wound up for the end of this quarter, think about one of the things that we're not spending money on, and that is productions and that covers television, it covered – this is Q3. It covered television, it covered studio and it also – we weren't producing – we weren't having ESPN crews all over the place doing games or matches. </p>
<p class="p p9">So, when you look at all of that, that had also the benefit of having higher cash balances. But once again, we don't intend to be carrying excess cash on a long-term basis. We do intend to be paying down debt, getting our leverage ratios back down, totally consistent with an A rating. We believe that that gives us lots of financial flexibility, and we think our shareholders have enjoyed that financial flexibility by some of the things that we've been able to do.</p>
<p class="p p9">And lastly, I would say as it relates to capital – of shareholder returns, we look at those and that's a longer term – it's a lot longer term out outlook. We will look at specific decisions with a COVID lens. And that's how I would address the issue around our dividend. Just have to look at where we are, what the prospect is, and how long we'll be in this COVID world. </p>
<p class="p p9">And lastly, one more thing, we still will invest in our businesses. That is the key thing that has driven long-term value for our shareholders, especially with our intellectual property and fabulous brands that we can utilize across the entire company. </p>
