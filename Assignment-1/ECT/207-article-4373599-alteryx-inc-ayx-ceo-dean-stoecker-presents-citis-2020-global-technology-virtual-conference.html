<p class="p p1"><strong>Tyler Radke</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">All right. Well, good morning everybody. My name is Tyler Radke. I cover the Data &amp; Analytics and Vertical Software space at Citi. Welcome to day three of the conference and we are happy to kick-off with Alteryx, who's also known as an overnight 20-year-old success story. And we're happy to have the Co-Founder and CEO, Dean Stoecker; and the CFO, Kevin Rubin. So gentlemen thanks for joining us today.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Dean Stoecker</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Nice to be here at Tyler, and welcome to everyone on the call. </p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Tyler Radke</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. So, Dean, I think you've been coming to our conference now for the past couple of years. And I think it's always -- it's great to hear from you just on -- you're out talking to customers a lot. And you've had the perspective of being with the company and for -- since its inception. One of the questions that I've been getting most recently is just on the demand environment. And I think the commentary just on the spending environment that you're seeing among Alteryx customers was pretty cautious relative to other software peers out there.</p>
<p class="p p1">I think in the most recent quarter, we saw that bookings were flat year-over-year and the guidance for the back half of the year seemed to suggest that you weren't expecting business trends to improve as a result of the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, maybe you could just start-off like, why do you think Alteryx is feeling the impact so much more than others out there? And do you think it's fair to say that maybe new customers or -- see Alteryx as kind of discretionary -- maybe just walk us through kind of the dynamics that you're seeing in the market?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Well, it's clear that with a pandemic where you shut down a $20 trillion economy and put 50 million people out of work, you're going to see some impact, right? And if you compare and contrast pre-COVID to post-COVID, we closed out Q4 of last year with 74% growth in revenue. I think it was 45% in Q1. And of course, we then hit the air pocket. We went into work-from-home environments. And I think that what lots of organizations did, including ours is that we looked at all of the spend and said, we have to be able to work from home first. We then have to have security to protect those workers working from home. And I think that analytics did take a haircut.</p>
<p class="p p1">I think that we've guided to what we can see in the marketplace. There's some improved visibility although not a ton coming into Q3, but -- and I think, if you look at, any of the research that's beginning to eke out now from the Gartners of the world is they said that, there's -- well, there was 2.5% growth in IT spend last year. There's going to be a negative 7.5% spend this year; that the analytics space, while it grew 18% last year is going to be flat this year.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, all of these dynamics come into play when we guide -- although, I will tell you that, we guided to $500 million ARR, 30% growth in ARR. So, we're quite bullish. I think that the -- our narrative in the last call for Q2 was that, we got pinched a little bit by the line of business spend we have in our land-and-expand model. We have two paths.</p>
<p class="p p1">One is, we deal with the analysts. We just tried to solve a data munging challenge as part of their un-ramp to the analytic continuum. I think like our organization we said, hey nobody buys anything unless we have some approval process. We've even stood up a couple of teams internally to measure the efficacy of every spend.</p>
<p class="p p1">And then of course on the expand side, we got squeezed on the high end in our top-down selling motion, where a lot of our larger customers who have these bigger expansions in mind said, well, let's slow down, we want to make sure that we're prioritizing this against everything else.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">But in the long run Tyler, its -- analytics is still top of mind. I've spent a lion's share of the past 120 days talking to executives around the world in every vertical, in every functional area and analytics is critical. They recognize that transformation is here to stay and they've got to figure out how to table the data that not only exist today behind the firewall, but out in the cloud, let alone all the new data sets that are emerging.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. Great, that's a helpful overview. And I wanted to kind of tie in the pricing angle here too. Because I think, clearly in the analytics space, we've seen several evolutions of pricing models. For instance, Tableau had to move to a subscription model kind of created a new low-end pricing a few years ago. And then, Alteryx even announced some changes to pricing, this year, with price increases on Alteryx Server coming out of the New Year. And then, you introduced this new Hub model as part of the APA platform that you rolled out.</p>
<p class="p p2">Could you just talk about the pricing of Alteryx in the current environment? I mean clearly, I don't think, slightly -- yes $5,000 a year, per user is definitely a premium product relative to other analytics tools out there, granted the ROI can be significant. But, yes, how do you feel about the current price of Alteryx in the current environment?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, I think, we've proven time and time again, year after year after year, since launching our land and expand model in 2014 that price is not really -- and it has no negative impact on spend. Now, obviously, with COVID and everything gets shut down, the analyst who has been trying to extract themselves out of complex vlookups in Excel has probably been told, just to use an Excel until we see what's on the other side of COVID and then we'll go with Alteryx.</p>
<p class="p p2">The reality is, if you go to community.alteryx.com and I would encourage all the investors and listeners to go there, you'll see, I don't know, 250 use cases across every sector of business around the world. And you'll see ridiculous use cases. You'll see 757% improvements in operational efficiency gains, at big organizations. You'll see on-time deliveries with the 11% cuts to spend and shipping costs. You'll see $1 billion top line improvements and $600 million bottom line improvements by using simple designers at $5,000.</p>
<p class="p p2">So, I don't think -- when we ask the question about is Alteryx priced appropriately? We do believe it is. Even Server, we really haven't seen an impact on server implementations, even after the 30% price increase. The Hub initiative actually lowers the price of our platform that unifies the experience.</p>
<p class="p p2">So we're really dealing with more about usability than price. I think, our customers will tell you, especially, G2Ks, where we've got 137 net expansion rates, price is not the issue. And remember for all the listeners that, when we did our IPO roadshow, we used the $500 price point, against the 50 million analysts that would become citizen data scientists, to get to the $25 billion TAM number. And even in our largest implementations, we're nowhere close to $500 a seat.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Interesting. So even at the PwCs of the world, there are the folks that rolled out tens of thousands of seats here, you're still not at that low end.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Price has not been an issue, particularly on large adoptions. There's perhaps some sticker shock for the solo analyst, who's just trying to solve a problem. But more and more, we're edging towards the top-down selling motion, because that's where 35% of the TAM lives. That's where the spend around transformation exists. And we'll continue to work with our customers.</p>
<p class="p p2">This year as part of our enablement program, we've begun to socialize value engineering across the organization, so that we can easily tell that story about ROI, either top line growth, bottom line improvement, efficiency gain. And probably the most important metric around the ROI is the, perpetual up-scaling of the worker. Because without that, it doesn't really matter what technology you choose. It's about up-scaling the worker, if you're going to have a prayer at seeing the $10 trillion to $15 trillion value that's locked up in databases around the world.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Dean, I wanted to follow up just quickly on the Server pricing. So it sounds like despite the pandemic, you've been able to kind of implement that higher Server pricing. And can you just remind us, is that for net new customers, or does that show up in renewals as well?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, every time we go into a renewal, well, obviously, negotiations occur. We haven't really seen an impact on that. Much of our, spend continue -- or our inbound revenue is still coming from designer purchases. As I think, we've said many times that roughly 10 to 20 designers begets a server. Organizations who've build out automation and understand the power of automation on the Alteryx platform, probably see better leverage on designers to servers. But again, for new customers, they'll see the impact on the server price, but it also affords us the ability to approach that customer with the hub offering. And remember, the hub offering is a $75,000 offering that is server tightly coupled, tightly integrated.</p>
<p class="p p3">In fact you don't really know whether you're in design time experience or run time experience. So we make it super easy and efficient to collaborate with other analysts on pretty much the entire analytic continuum from descriptive analytics all the way up to machine learning. And then, of course, we make it super easy to automate. And automation is a critical component in our analytic process automation category.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. And one topic that you talked about pretty extensively during the last call was the increased usage of trial-based licenses, obviously, given some of the increased scrutiny on spending and budget pressures that you're seeing in the current environment. Maybe just talk to us how you're approaching those trial-based licenses?</p>
<p class="p p3">I mean, my understanding was this -- this isn't necessarily something new that you're offering. It was kind of common in some of your larger deals. But just should we think about those as like big kind of upsell or true-up kind of opportunities in the next 6 to 12 months once those trials expire? Like how should we think about the conversion opportunity into fully paid licenses?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Sure. Good question. It's actually not a new call in the playbook. It's actually been time tested. It's been refined since we launched the land and expand model in 2014. That was the first year we started adoption licenses. And the whole point of adoption licenses is to help understand the demand from a customer.</p>
<p class="p p3">The organizations who are doing digital transformation often don't know how many citizen data scientists they would have on their team. We know from our research going into the IPO that it's somewhere between 5% and 8% of all workers are drowning in complex VLOOKUPs and there's probably lots of other tools that add to that misery. But the focus has been on those that are living in these complex VLOOKUPs.</p>
<p class="p p3">And so most executives when they say, they want to transform, they don't know if they have 1,000 analysts or 5,000 analysts. In fact, many of the users of Alteryx don't even have analysts in their title, which is somewhat perplexing to both us and our customers, but it tells us the audience is quite large.</p>
<p class="p p3">So we go to market with a selling motion that has three governors to it. There's a dial for the number of seats and servers that we deploy, the timeframe for which we deploy it and the price point that we roll it out at. And as part of that there's typically early negotiations to determine when we convert at the end of this, should we convert, what is the price for 100 users or 1,000 users or 5,000 users?</p>
<p class="p p3">And so, we've perfected the land or the adoption model over the years. And not surprisingly with the empathetic selling that we have our people go through in Q2, we had 100% sequential growth in the number of adoption licenses. And what we do know is that adoption licenses convert considerably better at a much higher multiple than a typical land and expand process.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">I'll also say that, that doesn't mean we're done with a customer. It usually is multiple adoption licenses. And often the adoption that converts leads to a fixed number of seats with an additional adoption license, because those that are serious about transformation, they're not going to settle for just 100 people, if they know that there is 3,000 people. They're not going to settle for 3,000, if they know there's 20,000. I think you heard on our APA launch that our folks over at PwC have now 55,000 users. And I personally don't think we're done there either.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Interesting. Yes. I think 55,000 across all your customers would be a nice goal for you guys. I guess, just -- so I guess going just more particularly on that. So you talked about this 100% sequential growth in adoption licenses, which is obviously pretty significant. But, do those adoption licenses have like a standard time frame? Are they six months, 12 months or…</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">No, there's some discretion we allow sellers to deploy. We, obviously, have a committee that scrutinizes these kinds of deals. We have, over the years, tended to have larger price points for the adoptions, shorter time periods for the adoptions.</p>
<p class="p p4">When we first went into this, we had no idea what the benefits would be or what the cost would be to support an adoption, especially if somebody found out that they're going to have 5,000 potential users. And so, we now have the data to prove what is happening in adoptions.</p>
<p class="p p4">So we make sure that there's sponsorship, executive sponsorship that there are people who are driving the adoption process. And usually, that leads us to starting the negotiations for the conversion really early on often before the adoption license even gets assigned.</p>
<p class="p p4">So, we're pretty careful about it. I think we tend to be shorter rather than longer, three months, six months. Early on we used to do year adoptions. It didn't have any incremental value. In fact, it delayed the ultimate expansion. So, we've gotten pretty good telemetry around what works and what doesn't work. And it just happened to reveal itself more acutely in Q2.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it, okay. That's super helpful. I wanted to shift gears a little bit just to use cases. And I think during the IPO process, I would say that the use cases maybe were not quite as broad as they are today. I think most folks thought of you as just like a nice data prep tool for Tableau.</p>
<p class="p p4">I guess what -- to me, one of the more compelling use cases, at least from a momentum perspective has been the success you've had in tax and audit, hence PwC and Thomson Reuters are some of the partners you're working with in that vertical.</p>
<p class="p p4">But, I guess how far do you think we are through the finance modernization, digitization, tax audit, you name it, in that kind of sub-vertical? Like, how far are we through that opportunity specifically do you think?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I think we are in the early stages of it to be honest with you Tyler. I think over the last three or four quarters, we've talked about this emerging use case in finance. And we don't have a finance vertical team today. And so, we would anecdotally hear about customers of ours doing FX risk modeling with Alteryx, and R&amp;D transfer price or R&amp;D tax credits and transfer pricing, and all kinds of things in the office of finance.</p>
<p class="p p4">And, of course, we use Alteryx in our finance team too, so we began to put all these pieces and parts together. And as you know, we work with many of the large accounting organizations around the world. I think we are in the very, very early stages of it.</p>
<p class="p p4">And what we even realized through COVID is that many of our new customers were using Alteryx for scenario planning in finance. And many of the customers that we called out like BlackLine and ServiceNow and SNAP and Merck and Qatar Airways. They're all using this, in the office of finance, particularly around understanding financial ramifications of various scenarios that could play out last quarter this quarter, next quarter.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">Yeah, I think it's early stages. What's so exciting about what we do is that having built a horizontal platform that's end-to-end that's code-free for the analyst, code-friendly for the trained statistician is that we never imagined the range of use cases that would become available.</p>
<p class="p p5">And I think COVID is interesting, because if you look at it from end-to-end, we've been involved in almost every aspect of it, from understanding the genome sequencing of the virus to figure out how it's morphing into new viruses, looking at the spread of the virus and how -- what the velocity is of that spread too.</p>
<p class="p p5">I think in the earnings call, we referenced the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia, who's using Alteryx to figure out when hospitals are going to reach peak capacity and when they're going to let people return to the office, and all kinds of things, all the way down to central banks around the world using Alteryx to manage the distribution of trillion of dollars to keep the economy propped up through this thing.</p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, so it's exciting. So, what's interesting is we've identified is no less than 18 use cases just in the office of finance. And I'm guessing that the organizations that live in that office day to day like the PwCs have probably identified a 100 use cases that we haven't thought of.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Right. So I guess, you talked about not having a verticalized sales force necessarily in finance. Is that something you're contemplating on? Obviously, PwC is a significant partner and Thomson Reuters are also in that space. But is that something you want to do internally and with partners, or how are you thinking about that vertical?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, clearly with partners, as we've demonstrated with the two of them and others to come. But we also see the need to have vertical expertise. As you know, we started our verticalization in the go-to-market a couple of years ago. We have higher ed. We have CPG. We have health care and Public Sector and SLED. And the office of finance has been one that's emerged in the last year that I think we need to take a crack at having a vertical expertise in this.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. I see. Well, I guess what other use cases or go-to-market motions, do you find kind of have similar characteristics in terms of the potential success or repeatability as what you're seeing in tax and finance in that whole space?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, I think every vertical has repeatable processes. I mean the center of APA is about automation. And so, if it were just ad-hoc queries that people need to do, APA wouldn't stand out. The reason we went to APA is that we see automation and repeatable processes being critical for every vertical. And so think of things in health care, where it's all the way from clinical trial analytics to predicting when people are going to reenter ER to sales force optimization.</p>
<p class="p p5">Think about retail, where completely disrupted through COVID and probably changed forever, where we're helping large retailers figure out network optimization of brick-and-mortar and omni-channel analytics for digital. And so all of these are repeatable processes. And I think that, again the beauty of having built an end-to-end horizontal platform as we can play into almost every single vertical space.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. Okay. So we've had a few investors questions come in on this topic and I also I have a question myself. So I wanted to talk a little bit about just the cloud. And I think a lot of folks when I talk to investors, they kind of struggle to understand why Alteryx is not cloud-based, when you see so much of the industry moving there. So I guess, what's particularly unique about your product or customer base that makes it that you're one of the few kind of analytics companies that isn't more aggressively moving to the cloud?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Well, I think there's just maybe some misunderstanding of perhaps what we are and what we do. So we have two experiences. We have a design time experience, where you build analytic pipelines. And we have a run time experience, where you execute these automations that occur in the business.</p>
<p class="p p6">We have had our servers up in BPCs up in the cloud for a long time. And so anyone who's interested, they can go up and for $9 an hour or -- and a few clicks to initiate a server, you can deploy in the cloud today. We have lots of customers who do that. We provide a server license and they can deploy anywhere.</p>
<p class="p p6">Again, we did that because we know that the data is going to be hybrid for a very long time. If anyone on the call believes that all the data is going to end up in one persistence layer, in one hyperscale cloud vendor, you're sorely mistaken. It's going to be a hybrid world for a very long time.</p>
<p class="p p6">We actually have in our 37% of the G2K. We have a lot of Global 2000 customers, who have zero data in the cloud, still zero. And we want to help the hyperscale vendors get there. And we have approaches that actually provide a bridge from on-prem to cloud. So our design time experience today is on-prem, but you can deploy it anywhere. And we did that because we wanted the design time experience to be closer to where the data is and closer to the context of the questions that are being asked.</p>
<p class="p p6">That said, we also recognize that at some point in time, there'll be gravity -- data gravity shifts. It's kind of like singularity, it keeps getting pushed -- it keeps getting pushed out into the future and we know that will change at some point.</p>
<p class="p p6">We've been talking about a browser-based designer for a long time, probably not for the same reasons that everyone imagines. Remember that the contemporary class of vendors that we kind of grew up with over the last decade were all cloud first and most of them were Hadoop-only. And most of them had to pivot to on-prem delivery and to trying to execute against any kind of a data set.</p>
<p class="p p6">And so when you think about the Paxatas and the Trifactas and the Datameer, and adverse, it has been a challenge for them. So, our choice to wait until we see what's going to happen, we're emerging from that now. We actually have in an alpha stage internally a browser-based design time experience.</p>
<p class="p p6">You will see something in the cloud next year. The bigger challenge is monetization of it. And does it change the go-to-market? Does it improve the TAM? Does it make it easier for our current customers to deploy the design time experience when you have broad footprints? So, there's a lot that goes into it, but when our customers demand cloud, we will be cloud. No doubt about that.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. Okay. And so here's a way to think about that that -- and I like to tell you, kind of, talked about the design time and the run time. So, is the way to think about that Alteryx designer, obviously, you're selling to business analysts who are working from their laptops or their desktops; they're not running it on their phone. That's kind of what sits closer to user. And then server is kind of more dependent on that customer's architecture that server's the run time and you can run that in the data center if that's where most of your data is or the cloud depending that's that--</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So, just using Alteryx -- on Alteryx as an example, so like a lot of organizations, we've standardized on many cloud services call it Workday, NetSuite, Salesforce, ITSM Solutions et cetera.</p>
<p class="p p6">And in our instance, we actually do replicate data everyday into Snowflake. And we have Alteryx server sitting next to Snowflake and we build our design time experience in the line of business. We populate it to server. We either do it in memory processing or we actually can take the analytic pipelines and run in database. Snowflake flows out because it provides compute loads for them to monetize.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">It's more efficient for us, although sometimes the prices to run compute can be pretty costly. So, we make it really flexible. And if it's not Snowflake and its Redshift or it's Databricks, it doesn't really matter to us. The data can live anywhere. It can be structured, unstructured, semi-structured. It can be on-prem or cloud. What we've figured out is that the hard part of analytics isn't on the endpoints or on the consumption layer, it's actually everything in between.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I see that. Okay, that's super helpful. I guess, maybe switching to a financial question and we'll bring Kevin to the conversation here. So, obviously, we got a pretty good ARR disclosure this past quarter both for the quarter and where you're thinking about it to the full year.</p>
<p class="p p7">And I think in the past we hadn't gotten much in the way of ARR disclosure and I think, you'd focus on revenue growth. Maybe just help us understand the thought process on disclosing ARR. What do you view as kind of the best leading indicator of the business?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Rubin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, that's a good question. Look maybe if we go back a little bit. In 2018, we were under 605 and so for us that revenue model was subscription accounting. It was ratable. It was pretty easy to understand and compare us.</p>
<p class="p p7">As we went into 606, our revenue mechanics certainly changed and things like the product mix and the average duration of contracts became variables that drove revenue variability. However, those variables were fairly stable, as we looked at what they were in 2018 on a comparable basis to 2019. So the growth -- the underlying growth rates were very basically driven by bookings growth. Because the other components of revenue were relatively stable.</p>
<p class="p p7">As we come into 2020, and especially post-COVID, we're seeing variability in some of those dynamics, specifically contact duration. And contract duration is a highly sensitive variable. So movements in that variable can have pretty significant impacts on revenue, but the underlying momentum of the business may indicate a different trend.</p>
<p class="p p7">And so we know that there's been a desire for quite some time to get ARR. I think we were at least a little bit apprehensive of introducing another metric for just the sake of another metric. But as we've gotten into the last several quarters, it's becoming more apparent that revenue variability could increase. And so ARR is another way that we look at measuring the business that eliminates the dynamics of contract duration essentially.</p>
<p class="p p7">So as you look at the business, I think all metrics are important. And I wouldn't suggest that revenue is not important, but recognize that revenue is impacted by things that don't necessarily change the underlying annual value of the business.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I see. And just a quick follow-up on duration, so it sounds like last year duration wasn't much of a variable. It sounded also like this past quarter maybe duration wasn't as big of a variable, but you're kind of expecting it to be more of a headwind in the back half of this year. Is that accurate?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Rubin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, that's exactly what my commentary on the call was. I mean, if we look at – we've had an average contract duration of roughly two years going back four or five years. I mean – so it's been relatively stable within that average. The back half of 2019 was on the stronger side of that average. And as we look forward this year, I think that's going to be a headwind to us.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay. Okay. Got it. I guess just turning back to the business Dean, I think I remember a couple of years ago like we probably would have had five questions on Tableau Prep by now. So it's probably nice to go into and not have to answer that. But I wanted to ask you, just curious if you've seen anything new from Microsoft. They have kind of this Power Automate, like obviously it's kind of extensions to Power BI.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">But as you've kind of announced APA and gone more in that direction, it seems like there could be some overlap at least from a marketing material perspective. But maybe how would you position them? How compelling is their offering relative to other players that you see in the market?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Well, I guess if you look at the extensibility of their portfolio, they probably have more ingredients than any of the other hyperscale vendors. Well, I don't see them having as a – I'll call it a mixing bowl to make sure that there's a coordination or orchestration of those pieces and parts. We actually become an orchestrator of everything that any of the vendors have.</p>
<p class="p p8">I mean, if you want to ingest Dynamics or SQL or Excel, you want to output and run Azure machine learning or access Data Lake’s from Azure or process to Sharepoint or to Power BI, we kind of become that orchestration layer for anyone who has the ingredients. And so we see it as a huge opportunity.</p>
<p class="p p8">In fact, one of the things just speaking of partners in general, we've actually – we have – this last year, we put together a team to go out and identify strategic tech alliances and we've begun executing on that promise. So we have relationships with Adobe. If you go up to Adobe, we can make it so that people can really drive value out of the Experience Cloud connectors that make it easy, whether you're in manufacturing or in retail to connected.</p>
<p class="p p8">The Experience Cloud process the data along with your data that's sitting in SFDC or in Workday and begin to get insights pretty quickly. So, these partnerships create a tailwind for us, because we now are entering into much broader audiences with much bigger exposure. So Adobe, UiPath, Snowflake and many others that we just see as great partners for what we've created.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">All right. Sticking on that topic, we have been getting a lot of questions on just what you think the IPO of the large cloud data warehouse company this way -- this week means for Alteryx. I mean, I know, you did mention you have -- working on a tech alliance with them, and clearly internally at Alteryx you're using Alteryx as a use case alongside them. But how do you kind of see their offerings and ambitions relative? Is more growth for them good for you guys? Neutral? Just kind of curious, how you position your technology alongside theirs?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">We love what they're doing. We think that they'll have a fabulous IPO. We think, it creates another tailwind for us. What -- as a persistence layer, what they want is compute loads. We make it easy for people to get compute load efficiency in Snowflake. We have several hundred customers, joint customers without having a partnership, without doing go-to-market execution together. And so, we're trying to figure that one out with them.</p>
<p class="p p8">It's not too dissimilar than the relationships that we've had in the past and continue to have with folks like Tableau. And I will maybe correct something you said. You said Tableau the use case is Alteryx for Tableau. Well, that's not the use case. The use case is typically descriptive analytics. And it might be NPS scoring. It might be territory performance. It could be pipeline management.</p>
<p class="p p8">In our case, we become the analytic pipeline to anything going into any endpoint, whether it's SharePoint, PowerPoint, Qlik Tableau, Power BI or a write-back to a Snowflake database that can then be queried for add-on questions that are invariably going to occur in the line of business.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. I think, it was just the perception around Tableau is that you were just kind of the prep tool for that. But obviously, it's -- you're not paying $5,000 a year just to do that.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Not a chance. And so, we're actually sponsoring Tableau's conference coming up next month. As we have, I think, every year for the last, I think eight years now we've been sponsoring their conference. Maybe seven years, I'm not sure. But we're excited about it is virtual. There'll be a big audience. We have a good presence and they've been great customers of ours and great partners of ours.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yeah. Awesome. I look forward to tuning into that. I wanted to go back to just the product side a little bit, Dean. So, you did this big announcement around the APA platform. I think it stands for analytics process automation. It seemed like a pretty significant update event. Can you just talk about, I guess, number one, the overall strategy?</p>
<p class="p p9">And then number two, specifically on the products released with this new hub model? And then I think you also launched a new predictive suite of tools as well. But just how do you see those as growth opportunities for the company?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Great question. I think that, for the investors on the call, I feel for you guys, because the analytics space has been very, very confusing. It is very fragmented. Everyone is covering off on one element of a very vast set of capabilities when you say data science or analytic platforms. And so to bring clarity to this, we saw what was happening over the last two or three years that there was a clear-cut advantage to anyone who could provide a capability that allowed you to migrate up the analytic continuum.</p>
<p class="p p9">From descriptive analytics, well, let's start with the data prep and blending because that's the kind of the necessary foundation for anything analytic. But descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, facial analytics, machine learning, if machine learning is going to eat the world, you're going to have more people in the mix.</p>
<p class="p p9">The second vector we saw was this focus on automation. And much like Tableau became that sort of launching pad into the continuum that we've been able to prosecute. We've seen the RPA vendors do the same thing on the automation continuum. And it's not about just a bot that is going to emulate human key strokes to extract the data out of the spreadsheet. But it's the ability to execute bots as part of analytic pipelines in an end-to-end platform, like Alteryx.</p>
<p class="p p9">And so, to bring kind of clarity to what we see happening, we defined a new software category not too dissimilar than what Workday did around human capital management, or what ServiceNow did around ITSM or Salesforce with sales automation. We've done the same thing around analytic process automation. And at the heart of APA are really three dimensions. It is the democratization of data and analytics. It is the prosecution of automation around business processes from simple to complex.</p>
<p class="p p9">And most importantly, it's about the up-skilling -- the perpetual up-skilling of the worker. Because transformation isn't about picking a technology, transformation it's about retraining your workforce. And most of our large customers, we've actually perfected those three components for them.</p>
<p class="p p9">And so we launched three products. Actually, I'll call it two products and a strong capability in our AMP engine just to get more scalability for our in memory-processing. But the two – the two product SKUs that were launched, first was Analytics Hub and hub is at the very heart of APA. And that is, blurring the lines between the design time experience and that collaboration around analytic processing, and then the easy execution of automation of simple to complex the task.</p>
<p class="p p9">So hub we rolled out. We were getting good traction with it. We're targeting those that don't presently have Alteryx as a server – Alteryx Server as part of their current mix. It will take us some time to get parity between the server and hub and the server that we sell to enterprises today. But we've really improved the experience around analytic process automation with hub.</p>
<p class="p p9">The second thing that we've done is that, we've launched Intelligent Suite. So, one of the incredible values and virtues of having an end-to-end platform is that, we don't have to be the only innovators on the platform. We allow other people to innovate. So our innovation lab created some really interesting use cases around natural language processing and the ability to decouple PDFs for example to turn a fixed document into a database that could be then used for topic modeling, let's call it, around maybe legal contracts, or sentiment analysis around documents that are stored in PDFs. And so that's one element to it. And it's all done with Python tools as add-on components of Alteryx.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10">And the second part was, assisted modeling. It is an auto modeling, I'll call it an augmented auto modeling function that helps train and up-skill the citizen data scientists to really understand, what data needs to be prepared to get what answer to what question to process lots of use cases to then automate machine learning capabilities that they've created. So, lots of good things that are happening around the Intelligence Suite.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Got it. And just quickly, I know, we're running out of time, but maybe just share your expectations on – well, I guess, first, if you finally get feedback or signs of customer demand? But like, how soon do you think those can really start to contribute to the numbers?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Dean Stoecker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">We're tracking pipeline build from both perspectives. With hub, it has been a limited rollout, because we know that there's new customers, we're pitching hub to because it's just – it's more cost-effective, it's a better user experience. And we're going at those that have design time, designers on premise, but don't yet have the server. And so, we'll be able to report in future quarters the success of both of these products.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Tyler Radke</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Okay. Great. Well, thank you both for joining us. It's great to get an update from you guys. And I appreciate the investors on the line for joining as well. So, thank you very much Dean and Kevin.</p>
