<p class="p p1">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. I’m Gaily, your Chorus Call operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the OPAP Conference Call to present and discuss the OPAP S.A.’s Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]</p>
<p class="p p1">At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jan Karas, Acting CEO of OPAP S.A. Mr. Karas, please proceed.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Jan Karas</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you very much, operator, and good afternoon, and good morning to everybody. Welcome to OPAP’s second quarter 2020 Investor Conference Call.</p>
<p class="p p1">Although trying to grow in business, amid these turbulent times has been a real challenge. We believe that the Q2 figures demonstrate that OPAP is well placed to face challenges. That's why we will start with our CFO, Pavel Mucha, who will comment on the quarter's financial results. I will then provide you with an update of our business progress and future developments. We will then answer any questions you might have. Pavel, over to you.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Pavel Mucha</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you, Jan, and good afternoon to everybody. Like it was the face with the first quarter, the second quarter of 2020 was again split into two completely different periods for both OPAP and most businesses in Greece. After previous closure, OPAP stores opened again on 11th of May and gaming halls opened on 8th of June. As a result, our year-on-year figures demonstrated a material drop; however, the recovery path post-reopening was according to our expectations.</p>
<p class="p p1">Before going through the details, let me as always refer to macro projections. It is obvious that all macro KPIs have plunged during the lockdown with GDP declining by 15.2% in Q2, and final consumption down by as much as 10.1% in the same period. The outlook remains weak especially since tourism which accounts for a material part of the GDP is hardly hit.</p>
<p class="p p1">On the positive side, the government's relief measures are still providing some sort of support to several sectors and individuals, while the EU fiscal stimulus should also help towards the end of this year. Overall, GDP estimates for the year still come with a wide range with consensus figures pointing to a sharp drop of minus 0.2%</p>
<p class="p p1">Going now to OPAP's performance on Slide 8, total Q2 GGR declined by 53.2%, but clearly this metrics is heavily burdened by the lockdown period because between June 8th and June 30th all of our segments have gradually recovered with some of those mainly online and VLTs standing above flat sales levels.</p>
<p class="p p1">In more detail, most of it dropped by a nominal 45% in Q2 with post-lockdown GGR recovering, but still remaining negative between 8th of June and 30th of June. KINO has been gained that was burdened the most as the game structured and successes minute draws usually require more active time within the shop.</p>
<p class="p p1">When it comes to JOKER, the addition of a third draw continues to contribute to the games appeal, providing with mild increase on average of the weekly sales. Betting-wise revenues declined by 65%; however, the risk part of major leagues led to a much improved revenue from June onwards, and Jan will refer to that in more detail later on.</p>
<p class="p p1">VLTs recovered quite strongly also due to the fact that the return to normalize post-lockdown was more established at the time of gaming loss reopened in June versus when OPAP stores opened in May. Overall, activity has been satisfactory, leading to a positive double-digit delta between 8th of June and 30th of June versus the same period last year.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">When comparing overall trends on Slide 9, you will find our performance versus the average mobility trends in retail and recreation. While we obviously lost almost all of our revenue during the lockdown period, we managed to gradually come very close to the mobility average in the partial reopening period and return positive year-on-year between 8th of June to 30th of June, clearly outperforming mobility trends.</p>
<p class="p p2">Through different perspective and as seen on Slide 10, pre-lockdown performance stood at plus 2% in the first two months of the year, while the period that includes the lockdown and the partially opening was down by 67%. The full reopening period pertaining linked to the full contribution of OPAP stores and VLTs i.e. from 8th of June till 31st of August was up by 3.1% thus outperforming even the pre-lockdown period, but the fact that August alone was down by 2.1% together with the COVID second wave makes us cautious for the future.</p>
<p class="p p2">As seen on Slide 11, the material diversification of the regional contribution of revenue demonstrates that even despite our shops reopening certain islands that have gone on tougher local COVID-related restriction measures or experienced lower local fruitful and spending due to subdued tourism related income are indeed underperforming versus the average. As a result, although Mainland Greece has still been generating marginally positive performance, the wide peers performance differs among different regions make up really worry about the upcoming autumn period.</p>
<p class="p p2">Moving on to profitability and turning to Slide 12. Recurring EBITDA for the quarter reached €23 million which is down by 74.7% for the year. However, looking at this through a different perspective, it took roughly one month of full operations for OPAP to generate positive operating profitability for the quarter something that we believe represents a substantial achievement and demonstrates operating resilience of our business model.</p>
<p class="p p2">On our part, we have been able to fulfill our commitments with regards to OpEx savings as our recurring OpEx base was done in the first half of the year. That's delivering on our promises when we look down cane. Going forward, both payroll and marketing costs will normalize in line with the future development of the business.</p>
<p class="p p2">Below the EBITDA line, we note non-cash impairments of €11.5 million mostly related to horse races where the Company numbers have been further burdened by the COVID-related implications and as such, our auditors recommended that we should proceed with such a move.</p>
<p class="p p2">Finally, moving to Slide 14, although impairments and amortization charges led to our net profit line to be negative for the quarter, we still managed to record operational cash flow of €70 million for the quarter. As a result, our cash balance remained exceptionally strong at €328 million without net debt to EBITDA ratio shaping at 1.6 times.</p>
<p class="p p2">Our solid financial position enables us to once more deliver and as that consensus expectations dividend of €0.30 per share on top of the €1 dividend, which was delivered earlier in the year and, this led to total €1.30 distribution within 2020, which is probably the highest yield when looking at both our international peers and also at Greek large cap companies.</p>
<p class="p p2">Just before sending over to Jan, I would like to end my part with a short reference to Stoiximan, which has now been renamed to Kaizen Gaming, and it's only the success of the Stoiximan and Betano brands. Its profits for the quarter increased year-on-year and in Q2 the profit contribution was €1.8 million.</p>
<p class="p p2">So, very strong Q1 together with the shift towards online during the COVID period in Q2 has helped the Company to grow in the first half of 2020. This is yet another reason why we feel happy that we managed to conclude the second part of the acquisition, and we are now holding an effective 69% stake of the Greek and Cypriot business.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">We do not stop here and we have agreed, upon authority's approval to increase further our stakes to almost 85% that together with the acquisition of controls upon auditors consent enables to consolidate the Company.</p>
<p class="p p3">With that, I'm passing things back to Jan.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Jan Karas</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Thank you, Pavel. Let's go for an operational review of our business for the quarter, so starting with our retail channel on Slide 17. Right in the COVID outbreak, we have put all of our efforts into supporting our agents during the lockdown and the subsequent gradually opening period.</p>
<p class="p p3">In more detail, we help them minimize liquidity issues during the closure period, we prepare a set of guidelines to help them benefit from the various governance measures, while we also provided with the data support whenever needed. At the same time, we're continuing on the path of our estate development by building and upgrading 153 stores in Q2, aiming for completing more than 300 by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="p p3">Additionally, we have proceeded across the entire network with a satellite infrastructure upgrade, enabling mortgage and all high definition content transmission. Powerspin, our new game is one of the first successful examples using this new technology. On top more than 1,000 stores as of today have been equipped with smart digital infrastructure that allows for centralized screens content management, digital communication, and creations of various gaming zones within one store.</p>
<p class="p p3">Finally, video walls representing the best audio/visual experience will represent in around 140 of our stores. All these elements are further enhancing our customer proposition, pursuing the local entertainment destination ambition. Set aside the changes and enhancements visible to the customer, a lot is continuing to happen also in the back end of our operations.</p>
<p class="p p3">In July end in cooperation with Salesforce, we have introduced our new B2B CRM, form making another important step in the digitalization of our back office. In essence, Salesforce is becoming the main collaboration tool of OPAP sales and network support teams incorporating all the network processes in a single system.</p>
<p class="p p3">At the same time, it enables real-time store view for both headquarters and from partners. We are also continuing our OPAP fleet initiative that aims at rewarding the best performing agents through various incentives.</p>
<p class="p p3">As for the VLTs on Slide 18, although both revenue and active customers obviously declined when taking into account the VLTs were not operational for more than two sets of the quarter. We continued with a set of successful initiatives, fully supporting our reopening in June. We have launched four new games, raising our game portfolio to a total of 100, while holding several initiatives such as loyalty programs and local thematic events.</p>
<p class="p p3">We also aim to optimize both our jackpots offering as well as our cabinet mix, having already reshuffled around 600 VLTs show us to better meet players' demands. Actually as a result of these actions, and as seen Slide 19, GGR per VLT per day of these machines that has been operational for a year came in at €44 in Q2, demonstrating a clear sequential improvement versus all the previous quarters.</p>
<p class="p p3">Admittedly, this is also a result of the urge of the players to resume their playing activity post the lockdown, but it is still indicative of the VLTs business dynamics now contributing for more than 20% of the group GGR.</p>
<p class="p p3">Sports betting-wise on Slide 20 and 21, we continue to enhance our sports book following best practices across the industry. Licensing is now almost 50% of best place with SSBT accounting for more than 34% of the wagers. In addition, virtuals have gain ground on back of a successful product re-launch and customers' interests shift due to the lack of sports events in early Q2.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">That said, the restart of major leagues in June and the conclusion of the European Champions League in August led to an increase year-over-year betting revenues between June and August, but more importantly made clear that sports leagues and events can and most probably will now continue to happen, obviously adapting to the new norm with no or limited teams fans present at the venues.</p>
<p class="p p4">Overall, given the situation, we have satisfied with the games performance, but now that the delayed conclusion of most league seasons is also meaning that 2020 and 2021 leagues will start later thus causing a shift in late August-September revenues.</p>
<p class="p p4">The last day of Q2 was marked by the introduction of Powerspin across the whole of OPAP stores estate. As seen on Slide 22, this new game is further enriching our wide portfolio of OPAP games and perfectly complementing our players' experience. The game's awareness has been supported by launch campaign, providing with encouraging early performance science.</p>
<p class="p p4">On the online front and Slide 23, revenues has been sustained at the high levels with both Stoiximan and Joker demonstrating materially improved year-over-year performance. GGR moves from just €2.4 million in Q2 2019 to €10 million in Q2 2020 at the same time also generating increased quarter on quarter sequential numbers.</p>
<p class="p p4">Both registered an active customers also increased despite the fact that retail reopen again in May. Specifically, our active base reached new historical highs of 140,000 players in Q2, primarily driven from Joker acquisitions and effective marketing campaigns.</p>
<p class="p p4">Online betting performance that has been affected by the lack of sports events was partially compensated by the launch of online virtuals. We also recently added some new features such as Joker subscriptions, which enables the player to participate in future growth and pay as he grows.</p>
<p class="p p4">On the operational front, we are implementing additional actions so as to further enhance this important line of business, which has been gaining market share on the back of COVID-related conditions. In specific, we implement the digital on-boarding thus reducing material-related costs. We introduced robotic process automation in our daily operations, positively impacting performance and customer experience and are constantly improving our VIP customers handling.</p>
<p class="p p4">When it comes to Stoiximan, the Company recorded material top line growth in the first half of the year, with Greek and Cyprus business growing, international operations gaining ground in the mix. Product wise, the Company has been successful into replenishing sports betting losses with casino, and we have every reason to believe that 2020 will be another successful year.</p>
<p class="p p4">Just before concluding our opening statement, our COVID-related approach with regards to our people has been one of abundance caution and at the same time enactment of best practices regarding proxy protection and contribution to the society.</p>
<p class="p p4">Our CSR program is continuing on every front, with the speed of response and collective responsibility being impressive. On top, the reopening of our OPAP stores and play stores as well as indirect channels has been successful through our partners' hard work and collaboration, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank them both for their professionalism and commitment.</p>
<p class="p p4">Together with the invaluable support of our employees, we managed to successfully resume our business in the best possible way, and I am confident that we will be able to stay on the same path.</p>
<p class="p p4">With that, I'm now concluding my opening statement. Thank you for your patience and attention, and I'm opening the floor for any questions you might have.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p4"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Stamatios Draziotis with Eurobank Equities. Please go ahead.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Stamatios Draziotis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. Hi, there. Hope you all are safe and healthy. A few questions from my side please. Firstly, first one is to current trading, in your presentation, you touched upon a few data point, but maybe if you could elaborate a bit on the latest dynamics. I would be mainly interested in what you've been seeing since the time tightening of social distancing measures for example the mandatory wearing of mask by customers. I think it was sometime around mid-August I believe. Have you noticed any effects which you would be kin to quantify?</p>
<p class="p p5">Secondly, as you had problems, you put some efforts on curtailing costs in the second quarter, and as you said, this was visible in operating expenses. Could you tell us the extent which you feel there is more room to lower costs in certain categories,[indiscernible] and if yes, which is my deep belief? That was second question.</p>
<p class="p p5">And lastly, I actually have a question on the big elephant in the room, namely the gaming duty situation. Has there been any discussion with the relevant authorities? And if not, when should we expect development taking into account that the extension period is softened in less than two months? Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Jan Karas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So, starting with the first question about the impact of the measures implemented in August. We have shown you on one of the slides, the trends we have seen in June, July, August, and as you have know noticed that there is an impact in August. In August, I think at the same time rightly interpret and represents how much it is difficult to predict any future, a lot of partially surprisingly developments have been happening on very short notice during August. We have been reacting and it's very difficult to predict what ahead of us and predict any trends under these circumstances.</p>
<p class="p p5">What I think is important to highlight though is, at the same time, in the last couple of months and I'll illustrate that there is and continues to be a customer interest in our games despite the COVID measures. So we believe that, the same way customers will be using to getting used to the COVID measures across the all recurring industry the same way this will become the new normal for them also for our own space.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Pavel Mucha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. The second question about the cost going forward, yes, indeed, in Q2 and during the lockdown, we managed to reduce our costs, very significantly. And as I mentioned in my introductory speech, we are now aligning the costs in line with the business development.</p>
<p class="p p5">So, basically many of the costs are back to the normality because naturally the reopening of our network of both OPAP stores and gaming halls, there are ongoing operating costs, which are required to run our normal day-to-day operations, but we remained extremely cautious about the future development and basically we are ready to come up with extra savings should the situation dramatically change.</p>
<p class="p p5">So, yes, we are always looking or for ongoing savings, but we need to really invest into our business for the future growth, but invest cautiously. And as soon as the situation -- if the situation was worsen again, we're ready again to come up immediately with some cost savings again, and those are normal running operating costs of the retail network, IP, and of course also the marketing costs.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Kamil Ziegler</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Third question will be answered by me, Kamil Ziegler, Executive Chairman. Hello, Stamatios, related to the new course in game duties, as we have informed you last time that the order on Greek authorities are already informed about existence of this contract, which is valid since the year 2011 and which is consisting of OPAP repayment of the GGR contribution for the period OPAP 2022 or OPAP 2030 in amount €1.83 billion. And since that moment that we are not -- there is no further updates about any negotiations, and what is quite clear that OPAP is fully ready to implement this contractual agreement during the coming period.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Stamatios Draziotis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay, that's clear. Thank you. Okay. And then, may I ask a follow-up on, on actually the non-gaming activity, if I may, which is in fact correct. They were actually surprisingly strong in Q2 or I would say, they were back to normal levels looking at your other operating income line. Could you maybe elaborate a bit on what you've been doing there? And what your plans are in the coming months?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Pavel Mucha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, basically, within our pricing income, it's not only non-gaming activities, they have been unfortunately impacted in a similar way as the gaming activities, but we have some one-off items within other operating income, which are helping our performance in this line.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Stamatios Draziotis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. So, you mean about your non-gaming activities were down in growing sync with the rest of the business?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Pavel Mucha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, in a way, there were because obviously our non-gaming activities still happen mostly in OPAP stores, although part of them, very small part of them happens in the independent retail where still the stocks are open, but OPAP stores are closed so obviously our non-gaming activities were also impacted.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Stamatios Draziotis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. And sorry about them, may I ask a final one and follow-up on this. So, in H1, what's the amount in other operating income, which is like non-recurring or one-off? Or if you don't have number handy, we can take it offline.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Pavel Mucha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">But then, you look at like-for-like basis which we reported there is fully adjusted there, so that’s probably what I would mention.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">The next question comes from the line of Mantzavras Paris with Pantelakis Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Mantzavras Paris</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, good afternoon from my side, two questions, if I may. The first one, first to the disclosures you make about the performance in the island during the August. Would you say that this because of lower incomes related to tourism from the residents islands? Or do you believe that there is a direct impact from less tourism also? And secondly, can you update us please on the CEO succession process? And who was done with that? Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Kamil Ziegler</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">On the islands, yes, you are getting right, it’s both, and it's not only current disposable income of the people, it's obviously the high level of cautiousness of the locals that is connectively the decrease in or the significant decreases we all see in the traffic industry. So, it's not only here now, it's also about the people being very much more cautious about what's coming later in the year. So, you're pretty much corrected.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Jan Karas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Related to the second question that's will be answered by me, yes, we’re continuing in the selection of the new CEO and definitely what I want to stress is that we're, let's say, pre-final stage, and we expect it to be concluded relatively very soon.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Mantzavras Paris</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Just a final thing, if I may. Can you give us any indication on the timeline of the completion of the third leg of Stoiximan transaction because I understand that only then you’re going to be starting to fully consolidate the Greek and Cypriot operation? Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Jan Karas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">We have a clear step plan for the next stage where we will acquire additional 16% stake and sole control, but that time plan is really within this year. So by the end of the year that’s how clear step plan, we would like to acquire additional 16% sole control and being able to fully consolidate Stoiximan; however, we have some regulatory pending there, so it's not entirely in our hands.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">The next question is from the line of Memisoglu Osman with Ambrosia Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Memisoglu Osman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Hello, many thanks for your plan and presentation. Could you share with us how much of the GGR comes from the islands? And also with this minus two, we could get maybe I understand, islands are impacting it, but is there any more color you can give such as the performance of the different segments of the business, foot traffic and any other color that you can provide? And I guess, is autumn after the summer season goes away, are we going to potentially look at easier comps for the islands? That's one bit. And then on the online side, given the very solid results in Q2, what kind of market share you would say, you have now with your own brand and also Stoiximan? And what's the outlook for that market share once we get the new licenses in place? Thank you.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Pavel Mucha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay. Related to the first question, the islands stand somewhere in the mid-teens in terms of the total GGR contribution, they stand somewhere in the mid-teens.</p>
<p class="p p7">Now, really as Jan explained, the issue with the islands is basically local people really didn't have very good seasons. The tourism was significantly down, but also there is a large number of workforces is coming from the Mainland Greece because there are lots of seasonal jobs in hotels, restaurants, cafes, and many of them have been shut down during the whole summer. So also people from mainland didn't have normal seasonal income.</p>
<p class="p p7">So, they saw that pretty much impact the performance in the rest of the year and into the 2021.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Memisoglu Osman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And te segment performance, was it similar for VLTs, lottery, betting in August?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Pavel Mucha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">You mean in the island?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Memisoglu Osman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Overall, so you said, minus two in August. I was just wondering, if for example, betting was lower because of lots of activity was in July, right?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Pavel Mucha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, well, it was pretty much across the board without going into any detail.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Memisoglu Osman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Always, okay.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Jan Karas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Related to online, I will answer this, the single, let's say, the OPAP position in online market is really in the single digit percentage. Stoiximan positioned that’s what we can see. Stoiximan is market leader. Now, it's very hard to estimate to provide some more correct definition about market share of Stoiximan because what seems to be a little bit redundant some of other operators and especially where operators are playing some games with the customer bases. And sometimes, if you can see the official results or somehow published results of the most GGR, it's seems that it's not reflecting fully the reality. But definitely, what we can say about Stoiximan, is that this is undisputable market leader in online in Greece.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Memisoglu Osman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And regarding the outlook for the competitive environment and how you --</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Jan Karas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">We hope it will stay the same.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Memisoglu Osman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Jan Karas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And with Stoiximan and of course for OPAP as a whole targets, the very tough targets for the whole management team is to definitely increase market share of OPAP, especially once, we will have this permanent let's call it, licensed framework and environment. While we expect that it will be the fair environment competitive environment for all participants then definitely we will be able to increase our market share.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Mitra Jason with Sephira Investment Advisors. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Mitra Jason</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Hi, there. Thank you very much for your disclosures again. Could I ask you to repeat your response to the question regarding the intending expiry at the GGR tax position in October? I didn't understand your response. I'm just trying to clarify, how we should think about how those GGR tax positions will alter into Q4 this year? Thanks.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Pavel Mucha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. So, our answer again is, there is already the existing contractual agreement between OPAP and Greek State. And starting October, this contractual agreement assumed that OPAP will start to pay 5% GGR tax, because there is prepaid GGR tax for the next decade in the total amount of €1.83 billion.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Mitra Jason</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Right. So, would it be reasonable for us to assume that, in 2021 and beyond, the 5% GGR tax will be the steady state? Or is there another discussion going on?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Pavel Mucha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, there is something with this contract, existing contract assumes.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Mitra Jason</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Is there other discussions suggest that that would be anything other than 5% going forward?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Pavel Mucha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">As we were saying that's -- the relevant Greek authorities were informed. They're fully aware of this contractual agreement existing one. And about this prepaid GGR tax, this is anything what we can say, and there isn't currently anything on the table.</p>

<p class="p p8">So, there is no dialogue or expectation of that or understanding of any adjustment to that.</p>

<p class="p p8">There is, if we can consider a dialogue that there was a common exchange of information then the dialogue.</p>

<p class="p p8">The next question is from the line of Iakovos Kourtesis with Piraeus Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Iakovos Kourtesis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. Thank you again to account the cost containment measures you took due to COVID-19. What do see your CapEx returning to normal levels towards the second half of the year and where you would see your CapEx figures to safe for fiscal year 2020? Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Pavel Mucha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thank you for the question. Our CapEx will definitely finish lower than what would be the standard level. We declared in the past that our standard investment into CapEx per annum spent somewhere between €20 million to €25 million as ongoing replacement and the maintenance CapEx.</p>
<p class="p p8">For 2020, we will definitely stay, much lower than this level because; A, already during the COVID, we not only were trying to do the cost containment measures, but also the CapEx containment measures because we were cautious of CapEx. And frankly, some of the projects could not be executed due to the lockdown.</p>
<p class="p p8">So as a result, we canceled a number of the projects or postponed them for the next year. In the second half of the year like the OpEx even with CapEx, we are quite cautious. So, we're not stopping it completely, but we will come lower than would be the normal level of 100 million plus.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Iakovos Kourtesis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay taking this into account, should we estimate higher than the normal level of CapEx for 2021 or it will stay in 20 million to 25 million?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Pavel Mucha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">It's a bit difficult to say now. We are currently undergoing the strategic discussion for the next long-term periods for OPAP. We have a lot of initiatives, which we are discussing. So, at this stage, I would not like to comment on this one please.</p>

<p class="p p8">[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Pointon Russell with Edison. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Pointon Russell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Good afternoon all. Just a quick question for you. Could you just talk about what consumers behavior was like as they return to venues? Was it fewer people spending more or was it pretty much similar people coming through? And what's the difference in demographics in terms of the most slightly younger people more willing to come out versus older people? Thanks very much.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Jan Karas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thank you for your question. In terms of consumer behavior, it's something that we see evolving in time, but as you would expect, we obviously see customers being more concerned about the safety and security. So, they kind of think wise, if they want to walk into the store and spend time in the store. We see a large part of the customers preparing to say on the outside, which thanks to the good weather in Greece is at these moments possible.</p>
<p class="p p8">We see customers being generally cautious about the safety and security. We generally see a very positive feedback from customers about how OPAP has approached the security and safety and all the measures we have taken. And at the same time, customers are concerned tough about the other customers being responsible and behaving responsible.</p>
<p class="p p8">And there is something especially for those who are living in Greece, you certainly observe the same trend, every week, this is changing and improving in a good way, the compliance with the measures and people being responsible in their behaviors of wearing masks and behaving responsibly. So, that is evolving, but we obviously do see an impact on customer behaviors and that's something that we are also reflecting in our plans.</p>
<p class="p p8">Going forward, where we will be trying always to provide customers with a safe environment, and with solutions that will be addressing, this relatively new insights that I'm afraid are here to stay for some time and some of them even for long. So, we need to adjust to this new norm.</p>

<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Pointon Russell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">And do you have any fear for spend per customer? Has that been some other catch up spend from those customers who perhaps haven't spent over the last over the lockdown period?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Jan Karas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Again, I think it would be very irresponsible to say that we have no fear. Many things may change in the months to come. Many different developments may happen. And even though, we'll obviously pray and hope for the best for the people in Greece. We are obviously prepared also for some of the best scenarios, the worse case being again some significant lockdowns on the specific geographic area, so hopefully not Greek wide.</p>
<p class="p p9">So, we'll see how that evolves. Spent per customer is one of the categories where many different evolutions may happen, depending on how the whole economic will be doing, and what people will see in terms of the microeconomic situations and measure supply, difficult to forecast.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Pointon Russell</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes, I know it's difficult to forecast, but how was spend per customer when they were back in the shop? Was it a few customers spending more because there was a bit of pent up demand having not spent through the summer?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Jan Karas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">We haven't seen dramatic decrease. We have seen slight decrease. We have seen also a slight decrease in time spent, not that much occasion. So, it seems like people continue to come following the usual habits, but they tend to spend less time or they are trying to avoid saying spending -- excuse me, they trying to avoid staying on the inside because of the security concerns.</p>

<p class="p p9">We have a follow-up question from the line of Memisoglu Osman with Ambrosia Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Memisoglu Osman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">I just wanted to touch upon your capital allocation, i.e., the dividend angle, obviously. How frequently are you considering this? You just made payment obviously, if things were to normalize and I realized there is uncertainty. Could we expect another announcement along with the third quarter results? Or is it totally of the plans now given the various moving parts? Any color there would be helpful? Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Jan Karas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">As you know, we've made very high distribution already during 2020, in total, €1.30. Yes, in normal circumstances, we would be thinking about interim dividend. Currently, we have to extremely cautious about what COVID will bring going forward. So, I think it's too early to discuss that. We have to wait and see how the COVID develops, how the business develops.</p>
