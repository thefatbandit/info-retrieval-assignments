<p class="p p1">[Abrupt Start]</p>
<p class="p p1">â€¦Biegelsen, the medical device analyst at Wells Fargo. And it's my pleasure to host this session with the CFO, Karen Parkhill of Medtronic.</p>
<p class="p p1">In terms of the format, it is going to be a fireside chat for 30 minutes. And we're going to try to do a couple of polling questions, which have worked well so far. So, Karen, thank you so much for joining us.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Karen Parkhill</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you, Larry. Thrilled to be here. </p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Larry Biegelsen</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. So why don't we start, Karen, with the recent news about the new operating model at Medtronic. Can you please talk about the rationale behind it and what changes you're making in the organization?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Sure. I'm really happy to talk about that. We've talked about our vision of being the leading healthcare technology company. And as we focus on that vision, we realized that we needed to change our matrix organizational structure to really realize that vision. So our new operating model, which we are beginning to make happen is really a transformation that simplifies our structure, where we're focused on becoming more nimble, more competitive, focus on accelerating our innovation, which in turn accelerates our growth and our market share.</p>
<p class="p p1">We're also focused on enhancing our customer experience and our employee experience within Medtronic. And really the primary change that we're doing is reorganizing our four groups and their respective business units into more highly focused accountable and empowered operating units that will be organized around specific therapy areas.</p>
<p class="p p1">And this is really designed to accelerate our decision-making, drive our growth, make us closer to the customer, drive better execution. We're also centralizing our operations and we're focused on driving even greater efficiencies within our enabling functions at the enterprise level. And that's really designed to provide greater service to our operating units and really leverage our scale. So we're really excited and you're going to hear more about these changes directly from Geoff at our Investor Day.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">That's helpful, Karen. So CVG, MITG, Diabetes and what did I forget there? I forgot RTG. Are those going away? Or will you still have those four divisions?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">From a segment reporting perspective, we'll figure out if there are any changes to segment reporting. I don't anticipate any at this stage. What's really changing is the group structure around those groups, where we're driving more of that structure into these accountable operating units.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">I got it. I got it. And is there one tangible difference for example where the sales force reports into from the old -- the current structure and the new structure that you could highlight?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. So there are some changes there. Currently the reporting of our sales force varied honestly by group and by operating unit. In some cases that sales force reported directly into the operating unit. In other cases, it was shared or reported indirectly. But this model does clarify the sales force reporting and streamline that they directly report in developed markets in particular into the operating unit. So that just helps with clarification and again decision-making.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">That's helpful. Are there people -- with any change there might be people who are happy about it, there might be people who resist it. For example, how are the country managers going to feel now that the sales reps report into someone in Minneapolis?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Larry, now that we've communicated these key changes across our organization globally, we are really getting really good feedback from our employees. And in fact, our employees are really excited by this change and honestly the clarity that it provides. As I mentioned, we're focused on making it easier for employees to get work done. We're focused on clarifying the decision rights and our employees are really excited about that. So, honestly, we're getting really good feedback on it.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Good to hear. And then, one financial question. In the 8-K you put out $450 million to $475 million in annual cost savings from this change. How should we think about the cost savings in the context of your comment on the fiscal Q1 call about not expecting much margin improvement at Medtronic above the pre-COVID level of about 30%?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. So, we will be driving cost savings with this model improvement and we said, it's between $450 million to $475 million. And those savings are really -- we're focused on having them enable greater reinvestment for us into areas as we're focused on driving and accelerating our topline growth. And those savings will also help us, ensure that we deliver a strong bottom line results in line with our long-range plan that we've talked about before of about 8% EPS growth absent the pandemic that's going on right now.</p>
<p class="p p2">We're not pulling back on investing in the business. We're very focused on continuing to invest in R&amp;D to ensure our pipeline remains full and that as we accelerate that revenue growth, we make it consistent going forward. And so, the clear focus is on driving greater reinvestment.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">All right. Perfect. Karen I wanted to transition to fiscal 2021. But before we do that, anything else you wanted to communicate on the new operating model?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">I would say just that we're really excited. We're getting great feedback. And I do think that this is going to drive an important culture change within the company. That we'll be focused on driving greater topline growth, taking market share, being more competitive, driving that competitive edge into the company that Geoff has been talking about. So honestly, we are really excited about it.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">All right. Good to hear. So fiscal 2021, you reported fiscal Q1 results in August -- late August which came in better than expected. Overall sales declined about 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis when we adjust for some onetime factors. You also talked about improving trends month-over-month and into August which was encouraging. So, I guess given some of the moving parts like lower bulk purchase and all -- purchases and all, how do you know that average daily sales are improving? And are there any data points you can share with us?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. So, when we looked at just our raw revenue on a month-to-month basis Larry, we had to adjust to really see the underlying trends. So, we first adjusted for the number of selling days in each month which were different in May and June and July to get to the average daily sales. And then we also adjusted for the extra week that we had and the impact that we had on taking down our bulk purchases. But after we made all of these adjustments, our company-wide average daily sales did see a significant step-up in May, then again in June and that continued into July and August. And so, we're really excited about this trend and we see things improving more quickly than we had originally anticipated.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">That's helpful. And you also talked about the cadence of growth through fiscal 2021 with Q2 down 9% year-over-year and getting to normalized growth on a statutory basis in Q4 -- fiscal Q4. So first question is, the negative 9% in Q2 seems conservative, given that you declined 12% in Q1 and trends improved through the quarter. Is that fair?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. So what we said Larry on our Q1 decline was that, it really was 17% on an organic basis and that's adjusted for the extra week. And when we look at the trends of decline of 25% in our fiscal Q4 and then 17% in our fiscal Q1 and that delta improvement of about 8%, we said that we expect hopefully some similar improvement of about 8% from that negative 17% into our Q2, which by math just gets you to that negative 9% we talked about. Could we do a little better than that this quarter? Yes, we definitely could, but it still depends on how the pandemic plays out this fall. We are seeing good trends and that's continuing.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">That's good to hear. Karen, you gave a very specific color on Q2, very specific color on Q4, but not much on Q3. Can you be flattish in Q3 on a year-over-year basis?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">We -- like many companies, we're not giving specific guidance in our back half in our [Technical Difficulty] in particular yet. But could we be flat? Yes, we could. It just depends on how the pandemic plays out at this stage.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. Makes sense. And just on EPS. The Street seems to be netting out and I looked a couple of days ago at $0.83 for Q2. I thought you gave pretty specific color that got us to about $0.78 in Q2. Am I missing something?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">No. When we talked about the color, we gave on the improvement in revenue growth and color that we gave on margins, which was really that we expect sequential improvement in growth in operating margins this quarter, your numbers are about right.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. And based on your comments for Q2 in the second half, it seems like you're comfortable. I know you don't have formal guidance Karen, but somewhere in the call it $4.03, $4.04 range for EPS for fiscal 2021. Any reaction?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. As I said, we're not giving specific guidance on the back half or the full year at this time, but we do expect revenue growth to continue to improve sequentially. And we expect some deleveraging to continue in the next couple of quarters, but we expect to be back to more normal revenue growth and more normal margins in our fiscal fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. And Karen, I know, it's ways off, but I'm intrigued by fiscal 2022 given some of the color you've given, because if you get back to kind of mid single-digit growth on a stacked year basis like fiscal Q4 of fiscal 2021 and kind of apply an underlying growth of call it 4%, 5% next year, you kind of get to about $33 billion in sales. And you've given very specific color on the operating margin getting back to pre-COVID levels by the end I think of -- by the end of this fiscal year.</p>
<p class="p p3">So I guess my point is that, it's easy to see -- or the math kind of gets you to almost $6 in EPS in fiscal 2022, which is well above consensus. I know it's a ways out and I know we're in a very uncertain environment, I certainly appreciate that. But I'd be curious to get your reaction to that?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. So, I'm glad you're thinking ahead, Larry. And I would say for us, it's premature to be commenting about FY 2022, because our FY 2022 is still 8.5 months away. It doesn't start until May. So we need to go through our annual planning process, which we have yet to start. It typically starts in the winter time frame for us. And the pandemic is still largely an unknown.</p>
<p class="p p3">But I would say as we think forward even beyond this fiscal year, we feel really good about our pipeline of products and our ability to take share in an increasing number of businesses going forward. So, hope you hear that excitement from us.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">I hear it loud and clear. So, Karen, and maybe we can touch upon some of the pipeline products later, but I wanted to ask about the investor meeting coming up in October. I know we can expect that to be virtual, I believe. Maybe you could confirm that. I'm assuming that. But what can we expect at the investor meeting?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">First of all, absolutely, it will be virtual and we're focused on trying to make it a really exciting virtual experience for all of us. So you should expect at that meeting to hear about how we intend to accelerate our revenue growth and increase our WAMGR. We've talked about the robust pipeline of products that we've got, many which are coming to market now and will come to market soon. And we'll be highlighting those obviously.</p>
<p class="p p4">We'll also lay out where Geoff is taking the organization with this new operating model, including the changes around our culture, particularly around our seed and our competitiveness. You'll also hear from many members of our leadership team around our pipeline and the strength of that portfolio. And then, of course, I will lay out our long-range outlook as well.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. Sounds good. And it seems like you suggested on the Q1 call that Medtronic is going to strive. Again, you mentioned this just a minute ago to increase its top line growth above the previous goal of 4%, but maintain the EPS goal of 8%. But you also said, operating margins could improve a little, but you're more focused on driving an acceleration in top line growth, while maintaining again the 8% EPS growth. Was that the message you were sending? And if sales increased by say 5%, where do you get the other 3% of earnings growth?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. So, first of all, that was definitely the message we're sending. We are really focused on accelerating our top line, driving that to consistency and still ensuring we deliver a strong bottom line committed to the 8% EPS growth, and when you combine that with our dividend, getting to a double-digit shareholder return.</p>
<p class="p p4">In terms of how we generate the leverage to move from top line growth to a greater bottom line growth, we will generate leverage. And much of that may come from operating leverage. Some of it may come from financial leverage. And we still have plenty of efficiency that we can drive in the company, because we're always focused on growing our expenses less than our revenue. And that drives the leverage.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. So, let's go with the polling question. So, we're going to get -- try to do both of them upfront here, if it's -- one after the other. So, Josh, could you please show the first one? So, I think everyone -- so what do you expect Medtronic to provide for its long-term organic revenue growth target in its upcoming October investor meeting.</p>
<p class="p p4">And I'll let everybody read the choices here, and it's pretty easy to just -- to answer this from what I can tell or to -- just click on the little -- the dial button. Karen, you canâ€™t vote.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I won't.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Good. I'll give everybody 10, 20 seconds. How are we doing, Josh?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Unidentified Speaker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">All right. I think we have about everyone, so we'll go ahead and share it.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. Drum-roll four to five. I'm a little surprised, four to five instead of five, because that's pretty similar to the four plus. Karen, any reaction?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Well, I think you're going to have to wait until our Investor Day for us to comment more on that. But obviously we're -- I've said, we're super excited about accelerating our innovation and our growth in market share along with it, because we're focused on creating long-term shareholder value.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. That makes sense. And like, why don't we do the second one, Josh?</p>
<p class="p p4">On the last earnings call, the CFO Karen Parkhill said, Medtronic is more committed to driving revenue growth acceleration and maintaining its 8% EPS growth target than driving operating margin improvement. Do you agree with Medtronic's approach?</p>
<p class="p p4">Something is missing here. Let me tell you what's missing here. I apologize. Do you agree with Medtronic's approach to the operating margin expansion? So hopefully that's clear. The operating margin expansion. Yes. No. Not sure. How are we doing, Josh?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Unidentified Speaker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">I think we'll give it about five more seconds.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. Again the last part should be do you agree with Medtronic's approach to the operating margin expansion? Yes. Okay. Interesting. All right.</p>
<p class="p p5">Well, Karen given that you've kind of confirmed that part. I think in your comments today that response has to be encouraging to you. Hopefully, it's encouraging.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Absolutely. I'm glad you agree.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. All right. Well, we have about 10 minutes left here. So, why don't we talk a little bit about the pipeline? I think people are interested in the Diabetes pipeline and the surgical robot. So maybe Karen, talk about the time lines. You just got the 770G approved in the United States. You have 780G approved outside the U.S. And so you have your sensor pipeline with Zeus and Synergy, and then you have 780G we're waiting for in the U.S. Can you just remind us of the cadence here please?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure. So I'll say upfront too that the same division within the FDA that's responsible for our approvals within Diabetes is also responsible for COVID diagnostics. So obviously, they're very busy. But we are working with them to determine the most efficient way for them to review all of our submissions within that business. </p>
<p class="p p5">And I would start with on Zeus, we're working with the FDA on that submission plan. Our data is ready and we're working to identify a conference or publication where we can present that. On 780G at the request of the FDA, we are going to submit a PMA supplement off of our 770G, which just got approved. We do have the adult 780G data ready to submit, but the FDA really wants to review that adult data at the same time that they see the peds data from us. </p>
<p class="p p5">So we're working with them right now to determine when to submit that supplement. But we're pleased that the FDA granted approval for that 770G last week. It's the same hardware for the 780G and we really look forward to launching that product as well. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Karen on the 780G for the peds data is that still in development? I just can't remember the status because you said that you have the adult data, but they want the peds data too. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. We're still working on the peds data. We don't have it fully complete yet. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. Do you know the timeline off hand, when it will be complete? </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">I know it's soon. I know it's soon and I don't know what we said beyond that. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. And one other question on Diabetes. You were deferring some revenue over the past few quarters waiting for 770G to be approved in the United States, I believe. Karen, is there any -- I don't think you've disclosed much information about -- now that 770G is approved in the U.S. some of that revenue will start rolling. The deferred revenue you'll start booking it. And will that show up in Q2 -- fiscal Q2? And are there any precedents? Because I know you haven't disclosed much on it, but any precedents with 640G and 670G that help us understand how much that revenue could be? </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. I would say first of all, we have held back some of our revenue as we work to fulfill the promises of the upgraded technology. That revenue per device is not hugely significant. And it will start showing up when we launch that product. We're working on getting the materials, the instruction materials printed in multiple languages before we launch this product. That is one of the requirements of approval. And so I wouldn't expect much in Q2 at all. It would flow more into Q3 and Q4. So obviously, it will help our growth somewhat, but it's not a significant needle-mover. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. That's helpful. And the Blackstone deal was definitely novel in the device space. So congratulations on that. Why did you need to get the Blackstone funding instead of using your own funding? And could we see you do deals like that in other businesses if it makes sense for Diabetes because it made sense for other Medtronic businesses? </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. Absolutely. So we always have a myriad of opportunities to invest in R&amp;D. And we looked at this Blackstone partnership as a really good opportunity for us to accelerate our internal R&amp;D spend in Diabetes already. And keep in mind, our spend in Diabetes is already above the corporate average. And when we look at our own returns, our internal R&amp;D is always going to drive the highest and best return. But the Blackstone deal had a better return for us than what we would see when we go out and do tuck-in M&amp;A. And so for that reason, we're really excited about this. And we look to do more where we can. With this current arrangement we have, it allows us to accelerate our investment in Diabetes in four specific longer-term projects, while we continue to fund our other internal Diabetes R&amp;D programs, and technically neutral to us in the P&amp;L during development. And then when we have successful commercialization, we'll pay a low to mid-single-digit â€“ back to Blackstone for a period of time. But we definitely believe, this is the right thing to do and we are excited about doing it in other areas where it makes sense.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So, you will explore doing this in other areas of Medtronic?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. That's interesting. And the other pipeline products that people are obviously interested in is the surgical robot. And I guess, broad strokes it looks like the major milestones that you gave at the â€“ I think it was September of last year in person meeting in Connecticut. Basically, the milestones were pushed out call it six to nine months. Is that fair? And how does it impact the financial goals you gave for the surgical robot last year?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">That is fair. We've said previously that, the delay with the robot was driven by two things. First, some software and integration challenges that, we had but are now clearly behind us. And secondly, the fact that operating in this pandemic made it difficult and harder for us to complete our preclinical testing work. But we have been focused on minimizing that delay. We feel super good about our progress. We gave the update a couple of weeks ago that we expect to file for a CE Mark and IDE approval in the first calendar quarter of FY â€“ of 2021.</p>
<p class="p p6">And then, when we think about the revenue trajectory that we gave you last fall that trajectory and contribution to our growth hasn't changed. It's really just been pushed out slightly as you said Larry.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">That's helpful. So we've got a few minutes left here and we've seen you guys start doing more M&amp;A recently. I think you've done three deals in the â€“ I don't know in the past call it six months, which is maybe â€“ somewhere in that ballpark. What are your â€“ what should we expect for Medtronic call it over the next 6 months to 12 months? Do you expect to be active? And any thoughts on valuations?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yeah. So we absolutely have done more tuck-in M&amp;A of recent. And we believe, it's the right time for Medtronic now to be doing those deals. We fully completed the Covidien integration, our balance sheet is strong. We're focused on supplementing our own strong organic R&amp;D investment by using our balance sheet with these tuck-in M&amp;A deals. So you should expect more.</p>
<p class="p p6">When I think about valuations, those have held up through the pandemic, particularly in the public markets. And when we think of some of the single product companies out there that are â€“ those valuations have held up. And so they're a little expensive. So we'll have to wait for some market correction on those smaller companies.</p>
<p class="p p6">But I would say we tend to buy a lot of companies that are not in the public market. And we often take early stage investments in companies and these structured deals where we'll invest early on in helping to develop a product and then have a right to buy at the end of that.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">So, you'll see us continue to do those kind of deals. It's really an extension of our own R&amp;D. We're focused on growing what we buy not buying growth. And you can continue to see us be disciplined around how we do M&amp;A to ensure that we're generating the proper returns for us and for our shareholders.</p>

<p class="p p7">That's helpful. Let me sneak one more in here. Any thoughts -- I'm starting to get a lot of questions Karen on tax rates. Any thoughts on Medtronic's long-term tax rate? And put you on the spot a little bit here I'm getting a lot of inbounds on tax proposals we're seeing from Joe Biden. Just curious what your thoughts are.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, it's premature for us to be giving any long-term tax rate guidance here. But with any potential tax changes on the horizon as always we're focused on optimizing and we're focused on offsetting headwinds that could come our way no matter what they are. So, you should expect us to do that should headwinds come our way.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">All right. Perfect. And I want to give you the last word here Karen. We've maybe we've got a minute or so left here. Any closing remarks? Anything you want to communicate that we didn't get a chance to touch upon?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Karen Parkhill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I guess my closing remarks would be that Medtronic is really finding a new gear here. And we are super excited about these operating model changes that will drive a more competitive culture. We're really excited about taking the strongest pipeline that we've had in our company's history to market which we're starting to see now and is only going to accelerate over the coming quarters and years ahead.</p>
<p class="p p7">And we're really focused on ensuring that we continue to invest heavily to not only drive that growth up but to maintain it. So, I'd say it's a super exciting time. And you -- hopefully, you can see it in our faces and in our voices and also you'll see more of it on Investor Day on October 14th.</p>

<p class="p p7">All right. Well we're looking forward to it. Karen thanks for joining us today and good luck with the rest of the year.</p>
