<p class="p p1">Hello, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us here on Day 2 of Citi Technology's - our Citi Investment Research Global Technology Conference. I'm Jim Suva.

<p class="p p1">So with that, Jim, why don't we kick it off? Thank you.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Jim Suva</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. Why don't we start talking big picture about demand trends, have they changed since we entered 2020? I feel like the beginning of the year was so long ago, we had everything from tariffs and trade wars to now the coronavirus. Can you talk about the demand trends that you've seen now versus, say, the start of the year?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Brian McGee</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes, let me start with that, and maybe, Nick, you can come on top of it. Our demand has been strong globally in every region in Q2 than in Q3. We talked on our earnings call, where we expected sell-through, which is the best measure of demand, to be about 900,000 units. We're seeing at 900,000 to 950,000 in the third quarter, and that puts us up 10% year-over-year and about 25% sequentially improvement in actual demand. So we're very excited about that.</p>
<p class="p p1">And so because so much of that is going through gopro.com, which is a testament to our direct-to-consumer strategy that's working. We're seeing even more growth on the subscriber end. We've put out a press release just a week-or-so ago, that said we were over 450 - or 400,000 subscribers. We think we'll end the quarter between 425,000 and 450,000 subscribers, which is great. And that puts us right on our trajectory for our expectation to be at 600,000 to 700,000 subscribers by the end of the year. So we're seeing demand on product. We're seeing demand on gopro.com, which is great. And that's translating into a nice subscription business as well. So from that perspective, everything is trajecting in the right direction.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. Thanks so much. Nick, did you have anything to add?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Brian McGee</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Nick, did you have anything to add?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">No. Brian, you broke up a little bit. So I'll just recount in case it wasn't clear to people that we have recently passed 400,000 subscribers. That was in a press release a week or so ago where we announced a new live streaming service for GoPro subscribers at gopro.com, where you can now easily live stream from your GoPro to gopro.com in a tailored experience that's really convenience and high quality. And in that release, we announced that our paying subscribers had surpassed 400,000. And we're now targeting 425,000 to 450,000 by the end of Q3. And we're on track for our 600,000 to 700,000 by year end.</p>
<p class="p p2">I would just add that while demand has rebounded significantly, I'd say, from the depths of the COVID - the onset of COVID and the depths of sort of the consumer insecurity, if you will, in the March, April, May time frame. We've seen demand rebound across all geos and all channels. And while dot com has done really well, as we expected, we've also seen a stronger-than-anticipated rebound at retail again in all geos, which is great to see, both for GoPro sales but just in general, to see consumer confidence come back like that.</p>
<p class="p p2">Now it's not happening in all product categories, but it is happening for GoPro's business. So we're grateful to see that. And that adds to our confidence for the rest of the year that we could have gone through what we all went through earlier this year and have come back as strong as we have, is testament to the strength of our products' relevance in people's lives today. It is a new world we're living in, and while certain things have changed dramatically, certain things remain the same.</p>
<p class="p p2">So for example, people aren't traveling on airplanes like they used to, but they're still traveling. They're still pursuing passions and adventures. It's just more local, more road trips, seeing more of your home state, seeing more of our country in the United States, for example, and people are still using their GoPro's to capture and share those experiences. We've expanded the GoPro's functionality to include working as a web camera now for people and, as I mentioned, improved the experience for live streaming.</p>
<p class="p p2">So net-net, people are still looking to their GoPro as a functional communications tool and our business continues to grow as a result. And when you combine that demand with our lower operating cost profile and improving margin, you've got a great opportunity to grow the profitability of GoPro, not just over the second half of 2020, but for the full year of 2021. So we're looking forward to it.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">In general, how do we think about the pandemic? Has it shaped or changed demand a little bit? For example, more of a willingness to go to gopro.com to make their orders as opposed to going to a big box retailer? Or also, let's be honest, fortunately, all of us have jobs right now where we're working really hard, but there's parts of society also that lost their jobs. How should we think about the pandemic and maybe anything that impacted demand, both on the positives and negatives, including you mentioned vacations? I'm not on an airplane either, but I'm surely taking day trips in my car.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Right. Well, consumer shopping has definitely accelerated to online during the pandemic, and you don't need me to convince you of that. It's quite clear and has been well documented in the media and by other companies that consumers are shopping more online and research shows that they're intending to continue to shop online. It's genie's out of the bottle. I think this is - the pandemic has accelerated a trend that was already very real. And that bodes well for our strategy to take more of our business direct and offer our GoPro customers more value than would have been possible now that they're shopping at gopro.com, we can create a much more valuable and convenient experience for them.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">And that will take even more shape over the course of the year. And our subscription service will become more central to the GoPro brand experience and any value that our customers have enjoyed from GoPro is going to expand significantly a little bit later this year. So we'll see that. And so we think that will just increase the likelihood that our customers shop at gopro.com. But let's be real, some consumers still want to shop at retail, and we have terrific retail partners that are driving a significant business for both of us, the retailer and GoPro alike. And their business is doing quite well.</p>
<p class="p p3">And so we're happy to consolidate our retail business to the best retail partners we have that are driving the best business and generating the most profitable return to GoPro. So this balance between being more of a direct company and maintaining the strongest channels that we have at retail is serving us well. And that - again, you mentioned you're still being active. You're still getting out and doing things as are many of our customers and that's important is that creates the opportunity for human experiences that people want to capture and share. And given that we can't share those experiences in person with as many people as we could in the past, that perhaps grows GoPro's relevance in today's world in that a GoPro is an ideal tool to share photo and video of your experiences with loved ones. And that couldn't be there with you anymore for the time being I should say.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And maybe as we dovetail into what you just mentioned about going direct, it seems like the Coronavirus just double underscored and bold, italicized. How important it was to go direct, because during the Coronavirus, I'm sure you're like, Ooh, thankfully we did this. As you look at that, can you talk a little bit about maybe it's you or Brian a little bit about the financial impacts about going direct? How should we think about it? I'm sure you have more control over your inventory, but also about pricing and not having a middle person take a cut, how should we think about all of those things?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Brian McGee</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. Jim, let me start there. As we've talked on previous earnings calls, going direct is here we get contact with the customer that we can market to in the future. So that's important from a lifetime value of the customer perspective, but also selling on gopro.com, we make anywhere from five percentage points to ten percentage points more margin than if we're selling in the retail channel.</p>
<p class="p p3">So as we've increased our percentage of our mix of our business from about 10% on gopro.com to where we'll be close to 40% in 2020, and probably about 50% in 2021 that adds between two and three percentage points of margin improvement kind of an year-over-year basis. And so we've kind of given an operating model of a margin profile of 38 points to 40 points of margin kind of starting in the second half of 2020, and then fully realizing that in 2021.</p>
<p class="p p3">So as we see revenue growth into 2021 with that margin profile and lower OpEx, we gave guidance for OpEx in ‘21 to be $260 million to $280 million. That if you kind of walk through that framework of math, that drives significant earnings expansion and cash flow for the company. So that's what gets me really excited about the business. And then you mentioned the working capital management being more direct, so we'll have less channel inventory. We control our inventory. We've always done a pretty good job of inventory management for that it gets better with direct-to-consumer and quite frankly from an AR perspective, our days outstanding will move from 30 to 40 days down to around 10, maybe 20 day. So the cash cycle from being more direct-to-consumer is much better as well.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">When we look at the Q2 results, I believe if my numbers are correct around 95% of your cameras were above the $300 price point, I might be wrong on that, but I think it's around that or above and say versus 40% or 45%, a couple of years ago, how were you able to charge such a premium? Is it really the software? Is it the easability of it? And do you think that, you know, we can go higher or is the goal kind of to keep it where it is, because at some point you don't want to price too many people out of the market and getting them to continue to be a subscriber is very important.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Well, what you’ve seen as we’ve.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Oh go ahead Nick.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">What you've seen is the value of what we've been offering our customers at the 300 and above price point is so compelling that consumers have moved up. It's more that than anything. And we've also gotten a lot better at managing our inventories, so that there is not as much legacy product to sell off at lower price points, which doesn't help margin, and doesn't help ASP. So a combination I think of those two factors, better inventory management, less discounted sales of legacy products, and dramatically improving the value proposition at the $300 and above price points has resulted in this very significant shift towards the higher end. And if you look at what our product pricing is, it's aside from the MAX camera at $499, it's what we've been charging for our cameras for years. So we're definitely not getting these higher ASPs by raising price, we're getting there by offering more value and managing our inventories better.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, I got that, very clear in that. That makes a lot of sense. And Brian, did you have anything to add on top of what Nick was just talking about?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Brian McGee</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, I think I'll add two things. One is, this was an intentional strategy for us to be able to offer better value at the higher price points to move the consumer in that direction. And that's been working. I mean, we were back in 15, 16, 17, in the 40% to 50% range of MSRP over 300. And we moved back to 75% in 2019, which is how we got back to being profitable. And we're seeing that continue that pattern end to 2020, which is also helping us with ASPs, we're selling a higher value products that are margin products, and that will generate the 30 to 40 points of margin that we talked about as an operating model. So that's all moving in the right direction from an ASP and gross profit perspective. And then being able to drive back to earnings.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Speaking of actions by behaviors. I believe Nick mentioned that you haven't increased prices, you're just adding more value and people are selecting themselves. I actually do believe that. When we think about heading into Q4 with the holiday season and who knows if Coronavirus goes away or doesn't get away, do you need to change any of your promotions or go-to-market strategies or how do you look at this holiday season say versus prior years, because some of the dynamics are a little bit different this year?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, no doubt. Well, yes, we have a terrific amount of data from all of our years in business and in all of the holidays and various marketing events that we've used to drive sales. And some of those will still remain true that data is still valid, but a lot of things that are changing, right? So they shift online is one of them, the timing consumers purchasing behavior over the fourth quarter is a bit of a tossup. I mean, general consensus is that consumers will shop earlier, because people are worried about getting their packages delivered on time because of the constraints with UPS and FedEx and U.S. Mail. And so we definitely think that's our thinking is that the consumer is going to be buying earlier to mitigate the risk of not getting their packages in time for the holidays.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">We think that it's going to be a competitive holiday as it relates to winning consumer share of wallet. A lot of brands across all consumer categories have been struggling, not everybody is seeing the demand for their product categories like GoPro is, and so that'll be something to watch is to see how competitive brands need to be, how competitive retailers need to be, but we feel good about how we're positioned and our own marketing plan for the fourth quarters already built into the second half and Q4 outlook that Brian provided on our last earnings call. It's built into our margin guidance, it's built into our revenue guidance. So we're not expecting any surprises. We feel really good about the value proposition that we've created or that we are creating and going to launch over the holidays at gopro.com for our customers.</p>
<p class="p p5">If we look at historicals on the value propositions we've had for consumers over the holidays, we're very well positioned this year with the launch of our new products and focusing on that launch availability at gopro.com. And then what we've worked on with our retail partners is also robust. So we feel really well positioned. Again, no surprises, it's all built into the guidance that we've given. But I think at a macro level, this will be a very interesting holiday because everybody's data sets will be helpful, but they won't directly apply to this year for a lot of people's business.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Nick, what did you mean by this year's data sets? I guess that's a bit of a newer term for me. I'm not that?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, no, no, no. Your historical data that you use to project out the rest of your year like you've said, this is a very different year going into a very different holiday quarter for a lot of brands. I think because GoPro – look demand for your products is a bit like air speed over a wing for an airplane, right? The more airspeed you have, the more lift the plane has, and the more control it has, the more control you have, the better you can land that plane on the runway, as it relates to your forecast.</p>
<p class="p p5"> GoPro currently has quite a bit of lift. We have a lot of demand. That means that our ability to navigate our plane onto the runway of the forest quarter, we feel is quite good for other brands that don't have as much momentum in their business. That's going to be a harder fourth quarter for them, because they're already coming in close to stall speed, how do they generate momentum going into the fourth quarter is going to be a real question for a lot of businesses, fortunately for GoPro, I can't stress it enough. We have a lot of momentum. We were looking at 900,000 units of sell-through for Q3. We're now looking at something more between 900,000 and 950,000 units of sell-through for Q3. So our momentum is building and that gives us confidence to navigate Q4.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. That makes sense. Nick and Brian, can we talk a little bit about some of your newer products, whether it be the 360 degree camera, whether it be your lighting category that you launched. Can you talk about some of your newer products?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, I think the - obviously can't talk about the products that we're launching soon in preparation for the holidays, but at a higher level as it relates to our product strategy, we've always seen GoPro as building solutions for people. And so we look in the market and we see where consumers suffering from pain points, meaningful problems they want solved, and is there an opportunity for GoPro to solve that particular problem for them in a manner that our brand is uniquely positioned to do, as it relates to product design, versatility, durability, mountability, wearability, and great design, and great value if we can do it differently and better than another brand is doing it, it's something that we would think about, but it has to authentically tie back to our brand, so that it makes sense for the consumer that's considering GoPro as a solution for their problem.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">And I mentioned brand because the brand is umbrella motivator for people for consumers that are interested in living in more active lifestyle. And we're here to address the problems that they may encounter when pursuing that active lifestyle. And that's why things like our new entry into lighting our Zeus Mini wearable, mountable, light and as well the lifestyle gear, like the new bag line that we launched there, meaningful brand extensions to customers that are either owners of our cameras, or they're just fans of the brand.</p>
<p class="p p6">They don't have an interest in buying our cameras, but they follow us on Instagram and YouTube and what have you. And they really relate to the brand. And they'd like to experience the brand in a manner that relates to them. And so these lifestyle products are our way of serving them. And as well, they add a ton of value to our subscription service, because GoPro subscribers can get all of these new products at a discount at gopro.com, still contributes to our margin outlook for the company.</p>
<p class="p p6">So it's still a net positive contributor to margin for us, but it's a real value add to be a GoPro subscriber and to be able to get our extended product line at such a steep discount at gopro.com. You buy one bag and you've paid for your annual subscription. So the math is easy for people to do, and we'll be adding to what our GoPro subscribers can buy from GoPro to add to the value of that subscription ongoing. So it's just our way of diversifying over time and better leveraging the incredible brand that we built over the last 16, 17 years now.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Thanks, Nick. You actually mentioned brand that you built. Can you actually talk about the products that you build, and this year compared to last year, there is a lot more say political headwinds about trade shipping, where things are built, and then you layer on the fact of coronavirus shipping products is more complicated, more expensive. Have you guys had to change or adjust your supply chain summit? Can you walk us through what you've done?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Brian, do you want to take that one?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Brian McGee</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, I will take that. Yes. There has been a very dynamic few years actually, it's not the 2020, it's kind of started back in 2018 where we looked at the political situation between the U.S. and China and move production U.S. ground production from China to Mexico to avoid tariff. That's largely been very successful. We worked hand-in-hand with Jabil on that. Who is our biggest contract manufacturer. So they've been a great partner in this effort and will continue to drive the business and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p class="p p6">You know, it's like when we went - changed our go-to-market strategy to be more gopro.com, and that's just another aspect of it. We've also - I had argued, done - made a lot of decisions that were databased. We could see the trends. We could see where things were headed. We could see particularly like on the move to gopro.com. We had data that said if we had the majority of inventory or if retailers were out of certain products, we saw significant lift in our business.</p>
<p class="p p6">And so we've been able to manage and navigate our direct-to-consumer business quite successfully in that respect. And so that's using - the use of data and how we analyze our business, how we go-to-market price et cetera has really been a nice benefit and enabled us to be pretty agile in how we go-to-market with our products and we're seeing it in demand on the consumer side, despite the pandemic, which is obviously a terrible thing, but in spite of that, we're being very resilient in how we go-to-market. And we're seeing that resonate in demand for GoPro.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">I got an email question actually from a couple of investors, and this is probably best for Brian, as CFO, asking about financial goals or measurements that you're looking at, whether it be margins or cash flow, not necessarily for this quarter and next kind of longer term, any type of yardsticks or measurements we should be looking at for financial goals and metrics?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Brian McGee</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, I think, well, end demand is one. So we expect to sell-through about $3.8 million units this year, it's close to our normal rate of $4 million. Our sell-in is going to be in 2020 about $2.9 million, maybe $3 million a unit. So that differential takes channel inventory down to appropriate levels. So as I look at things, I look at end demand on a weekly basis, we look at cash flow, we're actually tracking for our cash flow target of $130 million net of paying back what - the $30 million we borrowed. So that's up $70 million to $80 million in cash flow from operations in Q3.</p>
<p class="p p7">We expect to drive cash further in Q4, if demand stays at the kind of $3.84 million unit level in 21 that says we should see substantial revenue growth in 2021 over 2020. And so we're very excited about that. We think we can be in the margin profile that's 30 to 40 points given the trends we're seeing and plus the shift to direct-to-consumer, which on a weighted basis adds two to three percentage points of margin.</p>
<p class="p p7">So our normal 35% 36% we've been running. That's how we get comfortable into the 38% to 40%. And we're controlling operating expenses and pulling them down to the $260 million to $280 million level in ‘21, some $300 million or so in ‘20. So we're continuing to attack costs. We're continuing to drive our model and shift it more to gopro.com, but also really be balanced in the approach and taking advantage of so strong retail channels and partners. So we balanced the risk of the business between retail and gopro.com, and all that should be to - and our expectation should lead to substantial earnings power in 2021 as well as cash flow.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thanks, Brian. Nick, anything you'd like to add on that? It sounds like Brian has the financials pretty under control?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">No, I think he nailed it.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Great. In the past, some of your product launches with the gimbals and the stabilizers and stuff have been very much a wow factor without giving much about your future product launches. Are there still a lot of wow factor things that your customers are asking for, or wishing that you had, I'm not asking you to identify about, I'll tell you the past couple of years, each time I look at the product, it does get my attention, it does give me the wow factor?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I appreciate that. Yes, there is plenty of wow left, it’s either a blessing or a cursive humanity that, what excites us one year, bores us the next year. So we know that's the game. And fortunately it's also an aspect of a characteristic of humans that we're incredibly innovative and inventive. We need to be to continue to entertain ourselves and enable ourselves. And we've got some of the most incredible engineers and product people on the planet at GoPro, and they're why we're able to reinvent our products every year and continue to allow the way that we do, because we're big believers that it's all about harnessing the power of wow. If you can literally make somebody sit back and say, wow, when they see your product, we've done our job as a product people because we've really resonated with them.</p>
<p class="p p7">And so I think we got more on of that on tap for this year, but what you're going to see more from GoPro is it's not just about wowing with amazing hardware via cameras or lifestyle gear, or what have you. We also need to wow with software, because one of the biggest opportunities we've identified to expand our TAM is to serve as a solution for consumers via software, for example, via the GoPro app.</p>
<p class="p p7">And one of the biggest customer groups that we can address and solve pain points for our smartphone users, people that don't own a GoPro and maybe have no intention of buying a GoPro camera. We've recognized through our research that our brand extends well beyond just people that are interested in buying our cameras and that a smartphone user, who has an interest in photo and video capture using their smartphones specifically does look to GoPro as a potential solution provider via like app solution, for example, and they would be open to using a GoPro software product, even though they're not interested in using our hardware products. And when you think about all of the work that we do to build a phenomenal app experience for GoPro hardware users, you can imagine how we could tailor that experience and expand the tools that we build and the experiences that we build to better serve smartphone-only users.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">And as I shared in the past, that's something that we have slated for later this year. And we're excited to extend the GoPro brand to this meaningful TAM without taking away anything that we're doing on behalf of our GoPro camera users, they will benefit from this work as well. And they all use their smartphones to capture photo and video as well. So this is going to be a net positive for our existing customers as well as what we hope to be a significantly larger TAM for us over the long haul. And as we can all appreciate, the TAM that the smartphone-centric photo and video captures represents is quite large and gives us a long runway to develop as a software company and extend our brand in that direction. So look to be wowed in software as well as hardware this year.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">And Nick, on the software side on a smartphone user, is it - are you referring to people who maybe take video when they're on family vacation and don't have a GoPro Black or don't have a GoPro Silver or HERO6 or HERO7 product? Are those the people you're talking about in helping them with software to, say, upload it to Facebook or social media. Is that what you're referring to? I guess I just don't fully grasp this smartphone user you're referring to.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. I am referring to smartphone users who are interested in capturing and sharing and enjoying for themselves, photos and videos that they capture with their smartphone. Not everybody, the majority of people in the world are only using their phones to capture and share photo and video content. And we have identified significant pain points that you, for sure, suffer from and so it will be interesting to see if we hit the mark with you or anybody else in your family or friends network that now we can make GoPro quite relevant to you, even if you had no interest in the cameras that we make. We believe there are significant problems to be solved, and we believe we're the brand that's best positioned to solve it. So that will be an exciting new area of focus for us starting later this year and then onwards.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">And someone becomes a subscriber then, I assume, without the hardware necessarily, and maybe they decided then to buy the hardware at a further point. Is that what you're thinking of?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Nicholas Woodman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, but even if we don't convert people to being a GoPro hardware owner in the future, there's still a phenomenal opportunity to serve and monetize smartphone users with an app experience that we think is going to be really meaningful to them. And sure, if we grow a relationship with them and they, down the road, are having such a good experience with the GoPro app that it leads them to consider buying GoPro camera that will be phenomenal. But I'd say that's a cherry on top. That's not the strategy itself. We recognize that diversification is a beautiful thing. And we think diversifying into software makes a ton of sense for our brand and business.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Got you. Well, let me round it out now with Brian, can you talk about one or two things that you have been getting a lot of questions on. And then Nick, what maybe one or two things you've been getting questions on and leave people on this call about why they should be buyers of both GoPro product as well as GoPro stock. So let's first start with Brian.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Brian McGee</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, thanks, Jim. Let's see questions. I mean some of this around the risk between how we manage direct-to-consumer and retail relationships. And I think we've done a very good job. We're seeing it on sell-through on gopro.com, which we expect to up, at least on units year-over-year, about 300% or close to it and retail continues to do well. We track data, and we're very excited about the demand levels we're seeing. On the consumer side, despite the pandemic, people are chronically what they're doing. I guess I will reiterate the positive trends that we’ve communicated on our last earnings call.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9">And our expectation is to be profitable in the second half of 2020 to the point where we think we can be profitable possibly for the full year of 2020, which I don't think anybody was expecting back in the early part of the year. And that should translate into revenue growth and expanded profitability in 2021, thanks to our lower operating expense model, improved margins and more from our direct-to-consumer business. So I think if you frame out those metrics, it gets to be a very exciting outlook for GoPro in 2021.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Nick, do you want to close it out here with a few comments then or we'll close now?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Nicholas Woodman</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">I’ll give it a shot. If someone were to ask me, what am I most excited about in the future of GoPro and where does it go from here, I would say that I am excited that we have proven that we have a very stable, foundational business with a lot of growth potential. When you think about all that GoPro has been through and is such a strong brand. Our products are so well regarded. As you know, year after year, we release phenomenal products that wow consumers, we've established that.</p>
<p class="p p9">And next is for us to establish how we can translate that into a growing and profitable business, which I believe we're going to do back half of this year and throughout 2021 and beyond when we realize like the full year of this more direct business model with lower operating expenses and higher margins translates into a much more profitable business all the while delivering much more value to the end user, to our customer, which is the most important thing to do, because if you take care of your customer, they take care of you as a business. And I think we're going to show that in a significant way.</p>
<p class="p p9">And then when you layer on top of that, our growing subscription business and you consider that subscription is going to play an even more integral part of GoPro's business and profitability growth over the years. And you think about where we already are, already past 400,000 subscribers looking at 600,000 to 700,000 by the year end and you think about where that goes in 2021 that becomes very exciting.</p>
<p class="p p9">And then when you consider our ability to extend our brand and extend the GoPro app, to serve people that don't even - and monetize people that don't even own a GoPro in the way that I was just previously talking about and thinking of GoPro's brand as a hardware solution as well as a software solution for an entirely new TAM of customers and how all of this is really grounded on the foundational business that we have today. There's no major reaches one or another and we're demonstrating momentum on every one of these fronts.</p>
<p class="p p9">It just feels like GoPro is poised to deliver business and financial results that are in line with the strength of its brand and products in a way that we haven't done for a few years now. And that's why I'm so excited to be a part of the company and why I hope investors get more excited about the company going forward. And whether investors are joining the party now or come later, Brian and I and the rest of the GoPro team are looking forward to delivering on this vision we have, and it's an exciting time to be at GoPro.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Jim Suva</strong></p>
