<p class="p p1"><strong>Theresa Chen</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good afternoon. My name is Theresa Chen. I'm an equities analyst here at Barclays covering midstream and refining. Our next presenting company is Magellan Midstream Partners. Magellan is one of the bellwethers of the midstream sector with traditional energy infrastructure assets, primarily fee-based cash flows and an investment grade balance sheet. </p>
<p class="p p1">Magellan operates in two key segments. Roughly 60% of its business consists of refined products infrastructure assets and 40% is comprised of crude logistics assets. </p>
<p class="p p1">Given its exposure to the downstream portion of the energy value chain, it is currently benefiting from the rising tide of the domestic demand recovery. It also has one of the best balance sheets across the sector with a BBB+ credit rating, plus a solid track record of capital stewardship. </p>
<p class="p p1">Even with these premium qualities, Magellan currently offers close to an 11% yield today. </p>
<p class="p p1">And with that, it is my pleasure to introduce Mike Mears, President and CEO. Welcome, Mike. </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Michael Mears</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Well, thank you, Theresa. I'm glad to be here and happy to participate. </p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q -Theresa Chen</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Mike, maybe we can kick off the Q&amp;A, starting with your refined product segment. Just in terms of the macro demand recovery, can you tell us about what you're seeing as far as refined product demand, rebounding across your regions of service currently? </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">We gave guidance back at the second quarter call with projections for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. And through the first two months, we are in line with those projections. The total base volume has tracked very consistent with what we projected. Now per product, it's a little bit different. Gasoline is probably a little bit less than we expected. Diesel a little bit – pretty much right on track. And then jet fuel has been a little bit better than what we expected. So, in total, it's right on track with our base volumes. </p>
<p class="p p1">I will say, though, with our growth volumes, they have lagged a little bit our expectations as the volumes have ramped up, primarily because of the ramp up period. Some of those contracts have ramp up steps. And we expected the ramps to happen faster than the commitment level, and we haven't seen that happen. In some cases, the shipments are a little below the minimum volume commitments. So, if that continues through the course of the year, then there'd be a deficiency payment at the end.</p>
<p class="p p1">But right now, based on what we've seen, everything we've seen with regards to our refined product demand recovery is consistent with the guidance, the DCF guidance that we gave at the end of the second quarter. </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Is there any reason or causality between what you had projected for gasoline versus the slightly lower than your previous projections that has come to fruition currently? </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Well, I think there's a couple things. Jet fuel is a little bit of a mystery to us. It's doing a little better than we expected. It's kind of plateaued, but the jet fuel recovery, which I think is just trivial, but more planes in the air than people had expected two months ago has contributed that.</p>
<p class="p p1">Gasoline is an interesting – we found an interesting pattern there. The markets – our major metropolitan markets which are Minneapolis, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, those types of markets, the demand for gasoline is lower – quite a bit lower than what we had expected. And we would attribute that really to just the pace of people coming back to work. And it's been slower than we expected. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Here in Tulsa, we're moving quicker. We've got all of our employees back in the office. But in many of these markets, it's moving a little bit slower. The pace of children going back to school has been a little bit slower. So, those markets have lagged. </p>
<p class="p p2">But on the flip side, the rural markets we serve, which we serve – actually, the majority of our volume serves rural markets, that recovery on gasoline demand is almost back to pre COVID levels completely. So, we've seen a big difference between urban markets and rural markets. When we average those together, it's pretty much a little bit lower on gasoline than our projections, but not materially. So, that's the experience we've seen. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">In terms of where we are currently tracking in the demand recovery, have you seen any early indications of structural changes in the behavior of the end users? Or any tea leaves to read at this point or is it still too early? </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, I think it's too early. I think it's encouraging to us to see the rural demand back to pre COVID levels. That to us demonstrates that outside of the urban areas, life has somewhat returned to normal, at least with regards to driving patterns. So, that's encouraging to see. Clearly, the behavioral changes are still there with regards to the urban areas and employees not coming into the office. And that has an impact. How long that'll last is a little hard to project. It's probably a six month to nine month type of trajectory. But how much of that is latent and how much of that is going to stay after we've come back to a point of normal is a little hard to predict. We think at least in our markets, it's not going to be much retention of stay-at-home work, but it's still too early to tell. We'll have to wait and see on that. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">And I guess, given other industry participants expectations of structural changes in the market, you've seen closures of specific refining facilities in some areas that your assets touch, including New Mexico and Cheyenne, Wyoming. Does that impact or bring opportunities to your refined product assets? How should we think about that? </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, it creates opportunities for us. So, if you think about Cheyenne, for instance, we move product into the front range markets in Wyoming and Colorado. And we also move product out of that refinery. So, some of the early analyst reports considered that a negative to us. It's just the opposite. </p>
<p class="p p2">If you think about it, you now have a supply source that's been eliminated from the market. So, even though we used to move product from that refinery, say down to Denver, well, now that needs to be replaced from a further distance. So, now we need to move that product from refineries that are further away. So, there's a higher tariff associated with that movement. So, it's an opportunity for us to collect a margin improvement. </p>
<p class="p p2">And in addition, there's certain amount of volume that refinery loads at their own terminal, which now no longer is supplied, so that will bring incremental volumes to our existing terminals. So, that's a net benefit to us. </p>
<p class="p p2">And generally speaking, inland refinery closures will be a net benefit to Magellan. It creates opportunity for more volume movement to replace what the refinery was putting into the market directly. And it will create a longer haul movement for existing volumes because they need to be transported for further away. So, those kind of structural changes are positive for us. </p>
<p class="p p2">And if you envision an environment over the next 20 years or so, where you have slowly declining refined product demand, those opportunities will happen because it will put pressure on inland refineries and you will have additional closures. It's very hard to predict when and who, but it's likely those will happen over the course of time. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">With the facilities that have announced closures to date and the net benefit it has on Magellan's refined product systems, how much of a needle mover is that to your base business today? </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, those particular refineries, the two that are most relevant to us are Cheyenne and Gallup. Gallup is a small refinery that's really on the periphery of our system. That's going to have a very marginal impact. Cheyenne will have a bigger impact. We haven't fully quantified it yet. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not big enough of a refinery to dramatically increase our earnings. It's going to be a positive improvement. And I don't have the numbers yet. We're going to spend some capital in order to capture this. It's likely that capital is going to be low in the $10 million to $15 million range. And we're certainly going to get a very strong payout on that. But I wouldn't say it moves the needle a lot, but it's a marginal benefit. </p>
<p class="p p3">Now, if larger refineries close over time that are more embedded in our system, those could have impacts that can move the needle more significantly. </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">I guess, touching on the tariffs point that you mentioned earlier about, higher tariffs from that movement, just in general, for the FERC controlled or FERC dictated tariffs portion of your refined product system, as we think about the next FERC escalator taking effect July 1, 2021, where do things currently stand given your role under AOPL? Do you have a view on where the outcome could shake out versus the starting point of 0.9%? Do you have an update there? </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">I can tell you where AOPL's position and really the industry's position is and kind of frame the potential outcomes. I'm not in a position to predict what the commission will actually do. But I think we can frame the outcomes here. The commission has proposed a point 0.09% adder. There's two fundamental assumptions that underlie that calculation. One is how the commission is going to treat the MLP income tax policy that changed in the middle of this review cycle. And the second is what portion of the data set that the commission is going to consider. </p>
<p class="p p3">With regards to the MLP policy change, the commission in their initial proposal has proposed not changing the data whatsoever. AOPL has proposed modifying the data to represent the fact that even though the policy changed, MLPs had no actual cost change associated with that policy change. They didn't pay a tax before the policy change, they aren't paying a tax after the policy change. So, that should be a neutral calculation in the index. So, that's one difference in the assumptions. </p>
<p class="p p3">The other difference is the commission used the middle 50%. AOPL is arguing for the middle 80% because it's more representative of the actual cost experience of the industry. If you use the AOPL assumptions, the adder is 0.79% instead of 0.09%. </p>
<p class="p p3">So, that's the likely outcome, is it's going to be likely somewhere in between those two numbers. Which arguments the commission will consider and which they won't, we don't know yet and we won't know till they actually make a decision, but that's the bounds of where the number is likely going to land.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Can you just remind us what is the timeline for the process in terms of when they will entertain the different arguments or when that will be concluded and when a decision will be reached? </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Reply comments are due Friday. And after that point in time, the commission will deliberate and make a decision. Typically, that will be done before the end of the year. As with any regulatory body making a decision, it's hard to precisely determine the answer. There's no statutory requirement that they have to have it done by a certain time. But they have indicated they intend to have it done by the end of the year. So, it could be November, it could be December. Hopefully, it doesn't bleed into the new year. If we have a change of administration, that will slow everything down. I think that's one of the reasons why they want to get it done by the end of the year. So, that's when we would expect it is – I can't be more precise that. Sometime between Friday and end of the year. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">If there is a change in administration, and if it does bleed into next year, the risk that Biden could appoint a new chairperson to the commission and not only delay the process of this ratemaking methodology, but also the likely outcome, how would you kind of bookend those risks? Is that something that's very concerning to you? Or do you think it's too early to worry about that? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I'm not concerned about the outcome being outside of that range. I think that range is pretty well established in the data. There may be a risk that the commission sticks to its original proposal and stays to the lower end of the range. But this really is historically been a non-partisan issue. It's really data driven. And I think it would stay that way. The timing is concerning if it's delayed. There is a practical problem if it's delayed too long because the new index is to be applied July 1 of 2021. So, certainly, if there's not a decision before then, there's a problem. And it would be difficult to imagine it going that long. But you can certainly see if you have a new administration, you have new commissioners, they have to get up to speed. It's going to delay things. But again, if they go past July 1, then there's a problem with regards to application of the index. </p>
<p class="p p4">I don't envision that happening. I think it's highly likely it'll be before the end of the year. </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I guess maybe turning to your butane blending business within refined products, so given the volatility in both commodity prices and volumes this year, and I understand that you have been able to capture some of the [indiscernible] at the fall and executed those hedges already. But longer term, how do you think about butane blending as a business structurally? Do you think it will still be like a sizable component of your cash flows as in 10% plus as you have done in previous years? Or with this flat price environment and the uncertainty in how the demand picture shakes out, could it shrink as a percentage of your total cash flows? What are your thoughts there? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">We don't expect a major structural shift in the blending business based on the COVID experience. The blending business is a true margin business. We blend butane into gasoline which creates more gasoline and capture the incremental margin. There's nothing that's happened to change that basic fact that butane can be blended into gasoline. </p>
<p class="p p4">But the margin historically is loosely correlated with the absolute price of crude oil, with gasoline and butane kind of moving in tandem. The margin being much wider when crude oil is higher and lower when crude oil is lower. We don't expect that to change. </p>
<p class="p p4">Now, obviously, we're in a low price environment. So, margins are relatively low right now. If crude oil gets back to $75 a barrel, for instance, then we would expect margins to be higher. I'm not making any crude oil price projections right now. But it is a cyclical business. We would expect these margins to be cyclical. And we would expect that structural relationship to change.</p>
<p class="p p4">On the volume basis, the amount we can blend is dependent on the volume of gasoline that moves through the system. Again, we were optimistic and we don't have any reason to believe at this point we're not going to ultimately get back to a full recovery on gasoline demand. It's just a matter of how long. And so, we don't expect any structural change or problem there. </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">And maybe just more near term on the butane blending side, so you've been able to lock in some cash flows for the fall of this year. And then, early 2021, how has that outlook trended? Have you done all the buying, for example? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">We have not yet hedged for the spring. So, that's something that we're still – it's on deck. And we'll do it when the margins look good. But we haven't hedged that. That doesn't mean we're not going to capture anything next spring. It just means we haven't locked in prices. But it's likely here in the next few months, we'll start doing that, assuming that there's attractive margins to lock in, which we expect there will be just as there have been in the fall. For the fall, we're hedged 75%. So, we've got 75% of our expected volume blend locked in for the fall. That's less than we would normally have at this time. But we've done that intentionally because there's still some uncertainty as to what gasoline demand is going to be in the fall. We don't expect a second wave and a second shut down, but we don't want to be in a position where we bought butane and locked in hedges and then the gasoline volume isn't there to blend into. So, that's why we've been cautious on how much we hedge. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">If that doesn't happen and we're unhedged, again, that doesn't mean we won't earn anything. We'll just capture whatever the profit margin is at that time when we blend for that remaining 25%. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Shifting to your growth projects on the refined products side, how do you think about additional phases of the Pasadena Marine Terminal JP going forward? Do we need to see more of a substantial recovery in demand globally for that to happen? Can you tell us what has the interest been there? </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Given the current market environment, we're kind of in a low of development capacity. We think that we've got a very attractive facility. And we think long-term, once a product exports and worldwide demand comes back fully that we're going to have more interest at Pasadena, but it's at a low right now. </p>
<p class="p p5">It doesn't mean we're not doing anything there. We do have some active projects to substantially improve the connectivity, which will increase the profitability of the facility. But it's not adding necessarily more volume. </p>
<p class="p p5">So, there are some enhancements that we're working on at Pasadena that are going to improve the facility significantly. But we haven't – we're not actively working on full blown expansions yet. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And just given that facility can handle other products, including NGLs and chemicals, do you think that – so is plan A still to go with further expansions on the refined product side or do you think that you'll venture into these other products as well for that facility? </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, refined products is still plan A, but we have been and will actively look at other opportunities too. But those are in the same situation. There's a lull in those discussions right now also, just given, obviously, the pandemic situation, but we don't think that changes the long-term opportunity at Pasadena. It's probably just been delayed before we can pursue it more fully. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">On the Texas refined product pipeline expansions that you alluded to earlier, so granted that volumes are tracking below what you had initially expected because of the pandemic and all the demand disruption related to it. So, I understand the project economics are based on committed volumes. Can you just talk about, within your guidance range that has been put out there, what was the assumption at the midpoint? Was it just the commitments? Or was it something above the commitments? </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, our assumptions when we provided guidance was a blend of that. So, there was assumptions that we were above the commitment level during the ramp up period, which is what we're not seeing. But then there was the commitment level once we were at the full ramp level, which we haven't reached on all of those pipes yet. That's going to happen over the course of the next year. So, those were the assumptions that were built into our guidance. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Can you talk about your new market share agreement for the Texas refined product assets and what kind of upside it could bring? How does it work? </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, a market share agreement is really what it says, is that this particular shipper to the extent they have a market share in West Texas that they'll ship the volumes through this pipe. So, in this instance, they're really building a market share out there. Certainly, in this environment, it's tough to do that. Longer term, we expect they're going to be more successful. So, those aren't committed volumes. They're not volumes that we have put into any of our forecasts because they're uncertain to predict at this point. But we think long term, based on the strength of this particular shipper that they will build out a market there over time and those volumes will move on our system. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">The Midland products terminal that came online in July earlier this year, can you talk about what your expectations are for utilization of that asset in the near term, just given the volatility into upstream? </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">That facility has commitments. Those commitments have also lagged behind – those volumes have also lagged behind our expectations. But again, that's not surprising given the environment it started up in. We think long term, our terminal is right in the thick of the Midland Basin. And as drilling returns that the volume of that terminal is going to grow based on its position in the basin. But that's a few years out. We expect the volume to ramp up as the volumes on the pipeline ramp up over time into that terminal through the commitments on the pipeline that support the terminal. But that's going to take some time to happen. </p>
<p class="p p6">We're only one month into operation. So, the utilization is not extremely high yet, but we expect it to grow. And as I said, we've got a commitment from the producer in the basin to support that terminal. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">I guess that's a good segue to your crude oil segment. Just near term, given some supportive data points we've seen in rig count activity and such, what are your expectations for Permian production going forward? What are you hearing from your producer customers as far as their own plans within the basin? </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Well, activity is picking up, but I wouldn't characterize it as picking up at a blazing pace. Our expectations for the rest of this year are pretty modest for growth production, if any, in the basin. There's still considerable volatility in crude oil prices as we saw this week, dropping off. So, our assumptions really on our pipes are as conservative as you can get. We've assumed the contracted volume ship which are the majority of the capacity of the pipes, and we essentially have no spot volumes above that. In other words, we won't have incremental barrels moving in the open space. </p>
<p class="p p6">Now in reality, we've been able to do that to some extent over the last couple of months. We expect to be able to do it coming up. We've entered into new contracts that aren't specifically volume commitments, but they're margin related commitments that have – if there are certain markets are available, shippers will ship. And so, we're optimistic that there's going to be some, even though we haven't put any of that in our guidance. And part of the reason we haven't done that is because, even if we ship in this environment, the margin is going to be very low on incremental barrels. But there's a benefit to move the barrel because then we get it into our Houston distribution system. And then, of course, there's incremental income from moving it through the distribution system or loading it on ships. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Similarly, can you talk about what you're seeing as far as activity goes in the Eagle Ford and the DJ as well? </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Well, it's very limited there. Eagle Ford would probably have less exposure to it and less awareness of what's happening. DJ is pretty much status quo at the moment. But again, to the extent it affects us, on Saddlehorn pipeline, we're finishing up expansion. We have our full expansion done early next year. And once that's done, 75% of the capacity of the fully expanded pipe is committed long term from creditworthy parties for the most part. And again, in our expectations of our guidance, that's what we're assuming. We're not assuming any spot volumes above that, even though there's going to be the opportunity for us to ship those. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">I guess in light of the volatility that we saw in the second quarter and excess capacity within many infrastructure assets, how do you think about, A, your storage position in Cushing and, B, Cushing as a strategic hub in general going forward? </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Well, we don't think Cushing is going to change as a strategic hub. It's too entrenched in the market. There's every basin essentially in the country can get barrels into Cushing. And you have a number of demand points that are supplied out of Cushing. So, it's not going to disappear as a strategic location. It has competition from Houston and Corpus with the barrels moving in that direction. But Cushing is not going to disappear.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">With regards to our position in Cushing, 85% of our storage is contracted for three years or longer. So, at least for the short term, we've got – 100% is contracted completely, 85% is three years or longer, all the way up to 10 year plus contracts in Cushing. So, we feel very good with our storage position in Cushing. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I guess, for the contracts put in place, have you recontracted all of the agreements that that were done during periods of backwardation? If not, should we expect to see some tailwinds next year and beyond as you work through them, assuming that we don't go into steep backwardation again? </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">When we entered the contango market earlier this year, most of our storage was already contracted. Our business model typically is to contract storage long term rather than keep it open for our own trading purposes. So, most of it was already contracted, but the portion that wasn't contracted, we didn't contract. Those contracts typically were at a minimum to the end of this year, and in some cases into next year, into mid next year. So, all those contracts are still in place. 100% of our tankage in Cushing, 100% of our tankage in Houston, it's all contracted today. </p>
<p class="p p7">Now some of those contracts start to fall off, as I said, at the end of the year and into early next year. And we're actively working on extending those leases right now. We've done a little bit of that, and it's an active process, but that's normal. That's kind of the normal situation for Houston. </p>
<p class="p p7">Cushing is typically long term. As I said, 85% of it's long term. Houston's more of a shorter term kind of market, one year plus kind of market. So, that's not unusual to have those contracts in place for a year and then you're kind of in a constant renewal process. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I guess just looking more broadly from the corporate level, your capital allocation beyond this year, so there is a precipitous drop in your planned CapEx into next year versus this year and previous periods. Is the plan to sit tight and see how things evolve in terms of the demand picture before greenlighting additional projects or are there other things that you want to do with the money considering the free cash flow outlook is pretty supportive? What are your thoughts there? </p>

<p class="p p7">Well, with regards to project development, we haven't been sitting on our hands. Our plan, even through the height of the pandemic, if there's good projects available with attractive returns that meet our risk profile, we'll invest in them. The fact is, those opportunities haven't been available. And so, that's why you see a limited capital budget going into 2021. </p>
<p class="p p7">We're going to have incremental capital opportunities. We're working on. But the ones we are actively working on are relatively small in size, $10 million to $50 million. So, it's likely that $40 million budget is going to increase, but it's not likely it's going to get to $500 million or billion or what it was historically.</p>
<p class="p p7">With regards to buybacks, I think the market or some investors have had the perception that we've been sitting on our hands and put our buyback program on the shelf, that's not true. Clearly, during the second quarter, we have been cautious on executing the buyback program during that period, just given the uncertainty on the recovery timing and the uncertainty at that time on what margins were going to be available in the second quarter. </p>
<p class="p p7">But now that that's stabilized, it's clearly in the forefront of our thinking. I'm not going to give an update on buybacks activity today. We'll do that in the normal course. But it's something that we're actively evaluating, with the balance being that we want to maintain a healthy balance sheet. </p>
<p class="p p7">So, those two points – and really the three things we consider are that, the stability of the business which we think we're at, the health of the balance sheet, and also the valuation of the equity, is it attractive to buy. And at least, on that compound, it's very attractive to buy it right now. So, that process is active and ongoing. </p>

<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">We just have a couple minutes to take some audience questions that have been sent in. Related to what you just talked about, Mike, on the leverage front, this question says, the company has historically targeted a below 4 times leverage ratio, the cost of debt is lower than before and the need for CapEx funds is lower than before. Has the company considered operating the business with a higher run rate leverage ratio to adjust for these factors? </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">The answer is no. We haven't raised our leverage level. We don't think, from a long term perspective, that that's the right thing to do. Many of the things you mentioned are short term phenomena. And we're not managing the business for the short term. We're managing it for the long term. So, we don't have the intent to change our leverage ceiling, which is 4 times.</p>
<p class="p p8">We've said in the past, if there's a big project, it's very attractive, we might go above that a little bit for a short period of time. But that's not our plan. And that's not where we would operate long term. We feel that having a healthy, strong balance sheet, and strong credit is fundamental to the operation of this business. </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Theresa Chen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Just one last one. I'm eager to hear your response on this, Mike. What is the company's plan if MLPs remain an abandoned asset class forever and MMP never achieves a fair valuation? Would the company consider a take-private? </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Mears</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">I guess we need to wait till that happens to answer the question. But in short, we are not actively looking at a take-private. I'm never in a position to say never say never because you never know what the future might bring. And there may be circumstances where that makes sense. We're not actively looking at it right now. We are actively looking at the best allocation of capital to maximize return to the unitholders, whether it be unit buybacks, distribution increases, all of that's under evaluation right now, but we're not actively looking at take-private. </p>
<p class="p p8">And again, I'm not saying that it might never make sense. But right now, we're not working on it. </p>

<p class="p p8">Fair enough. Well, thank you very much for your time and your insights. We appreciate all of your comments very much. Thank you. </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Michael Mears</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">All right. Thank you.</p></div>
