<p class="p p1">Walter Pritchard - Citi</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Walter Pritchard</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">We are live, and I see Burt on. Burt, if you could – if you're still on and could turn on your camera. There you are. All right. There we go. We're all here. Okay. A little bit of a – skipped a couple of heartbeats there, but I think we're good to go.</p>
<p class="p p1">So I'm Walter Pritchard, software analyst here at Citi. Happy to continue the afternoon session with Burt Podbere, who's the CFO of CrowdStrike. And I think we have somebody coming through with some noise on the line. If we could just mute, if you're not speaking. So, Burt thanks for joining us here. Appreciate you very much spending the time.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Burt Podbere</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great to be here, Walter. Absolutely.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Walter Pritchard</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">All right. So I guess wanted to start out with a common theme that we've been exploring through this conference has just been the environment we're in, sort of how it's impacted businesses. And I think more importantly sort of how we think – how companies see things progressing going forward. I think you've reported a couple of quarters now within this COVID landscape including a pretty strong Q2 that you reported last week. So maybe just give us a little bit of a recap in terms of what you've seen in the environment relative to COVID and then we can spend some time talking about how you think it will play out from here.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Sure, absolutely. Good question, Walter. So COVID for sure has changed the threat landscape obviously with folks needing to work from everywhere and not going into the office. That's allowed the adversaries to kind of zoom in on areas, which are not as well protected as the old traditional office situation. So for us, the way we see things and what does that all mean for us, it means that companies can no longer keep their digital transformation plans on the sidelines. And in order to safely enable digital transformation in a distributed environment like we're in today, they need to transform their security.</p>
<p class="p p1">So it's almost like – it is the fact that security transformation becomes that prerequisite to digital transformation in this distributed environment. And as the adversaries, they're continuing to get more effective. They don't sleep. They don't eat. They're coming at you with more sophisticated techniques. You need security that's going to be able to block those and to identify those even in a distributed environment, where people are using different machines than they used to and different devices and working from different [Technical Difficulty]. And in order to do that, it's – you're going to need something that can be fully [Technical Difficulty] so I think the landscape the threat the attack surface area has increased and you're going to need technology that's going to be able to enable this security transformation that I just talked about.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Got it. And so how do we – I think the performance so far and the impact so far have been pretty clear. How do you see this playing out over the next 6 months, 12 months? I mean, you've given guidance through the end of the year so there's a set of scenarios that are embedded in that forecast. But I think you have a couple of things. You have the changes that it's accelerated in the security landscape. And then obviously, the macro environment is more challenging than it was a year ago. And I think that's having some impact on IT spending overall. But would love to get your perspective on sort of how you thought about the rest of the year and sort of into next year qualitatively with that backdrop?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yeah. No for sure. So first, I think that with COVID, there's been some puts and takes, right? So on the one hand, you're seeing this acceleration towards security transformation digital transformation for sure. On the other hand, you've seen impacted industries which have cut back on budgets for obvious reasons. To the extent for us personally, and we baked this into our guidance is that, we've got a very small percentage of our business is related to those impacted industries [Technical Difficulty] we talked about one on our earnings call with an airline. They still need to have security. And the beauty for us is even as potential budgets are shrinking the amount of dollars that are going towards security, specifically they're actually increasing.</p>
<p class="p p2">And then when you throw in the fact that CrowdStrike is able to consolidate a variety of different tools and technologies, at the end of the day we're able to offer customers an ability to save money. So it's one of those situations where you've got a company that can come out and protect you wherever you are, a company that can deploy immediately with time to value immediately. And ultimately, you can spend less overall with respect to a company like us that acts as a consolidator for all of these different technologies.</p>
<p class="p p2">When we think about this year we've talked about the guidance and I'll talk about it in a minute where I think the opportunities are and where the growth is not only for this year, but the years to come, but I think that you've seen the history which we've been able to in our minds have a phenomenal quarter in Q2 with strong momentum going into Q3.</p>
<p class="p p2">And there are a few things that I think about in terms of the growth engines that are out there for us and will be out there for us for quite some time. We've talked about the digital transformation and the prerequisite being security transformation in a distributed environment.</p>
<p class="p p2">The second one is the expansion of TAMs, right, as we come out with new modules, we've had a pretty good pace one or two a year that allows us for further consolidation with respect to how a customer sees their overall spend. Three, I think, and I'm sure we'll get to it as well the competitive environment. It's -- we're in a really good spot with respect to where we sit with our competitors. Whether you take the three big incumbents in the security space whether it's Symantecs Trends and McAfees, you see this huge opportunity for us in terms of there's been some consolidation already in the space with Broadcom buying Symantec and the ability to start to continue to take share for years to come with respect to how they're going to market and what they said they're going to do and what we're actually seeing in the field, so, really opportunistic in terms of a competitive environment today.</p>
<p class="p p2">And then finally, it's the durability of the business model. We're mission critical, strong leverage from our platform. It's that single agent. It's that data-driven platform. It's that ease of use [Technical Difficulty] that allows us to scale rapidly. All those things that we've placed bets on years ago are coming to fruition right now. And so, that's how we think about the environment for not only the rest of the year, but for next year as well.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Got it. And maybe we could use the first couple of quarters here that we've seen in COVID as sort of a test case. But you've mentioned a number of factors that have driven the results that you've seen competition, the mission criticality and TAM expansion and so forth. When you look back at the last couple of quarters and what's been upside in both quarters to your forecast. Which of those factors would you attribute as having delivered most of the surprise relative to what you were thinking?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. So, I think this acceleration of the deterioration of the perimeter and companies recognizing that that has been [Technical Difficulty] CIOs and CISOs kind of leaning in and saying hey we need to think differently about our refresh. So as companies think about the traditional refresh whether it was three years or five years, they're no longer thinking of a faster stronger box. They're thinking about digital transformation and of course then security transformation and thinking about the renewal very, very differently.</p>
<p class="p p3">And so for us I think that's been a really big contributor to what we've seen not only in the past couple of quarters, but certainly in -- as we think about our momentum in the pipeline that I indicated even on our earnings call, which is really, really strong going into Q3.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Great. Burt, just one thing here on our end. We're having a little bit of at times with your audio. I know you look great there. Maybe we could have you turn off the video for a second and just for a little bit here see if that improves things and then -- because the audio which is more critical is -- yes there we go. Okay. So let's keep going. And so on that end, I guess as you think about the competitive landscape. You brought that one up and let's address that one now. I think some of the conditions in the market around these competitors not performing as well as they have been were in place pre-COVID and then you have this environment change. How do you look at the combination of those two factors? Or has the just sort of stand-alone competitive landscape just become much more favorable on its own in the last say three or six months?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. So clearly, we're getting a lot of tailwinds from the competitive environment stand-alone Walter. I think that we've seen not only the incumbents be bought or have that inability to innovate. But also the next-gen player’s right? So a few of those have been picked off as well and been consolidated into other groups and they're finding it to be a tough time. And so for us, we see that whole group whether it's the next-gen players or the incumbents, really struggling, right? And for us we think it's a really opportunistic time to take advantage of that and we have. And you've seen it in the numbers in the first quarter and second quarter with the over-performance. And I think that -- that's not a onetime effect, I think Walter. That's for years to come, right? I think that the -- if you take a look at just our customer base, so we reported that we had just over 7000 customers. That's great.</p>
<p class="p p3">We're really happy with the 7000 customers. But when you think about the number of customers just on Symantec alone, pick a number 100,000 that are B2B, 150,000 B2B. Great. They said they're going to protect 1500 of those. And so that gives us this whole bolus of opportunity I call it Greenfield even though it's not technically Greenfield. But it's Greenfield for us because those companies are now up for grabs, right? And those customers are up for grabs and we're going to go after them and we've seen some of the impact on our numbers to date. And that's something that's going to go on for years. So we're really excited about that. </p>
<p class="p p3">Our competitors who have been coming up through the ranks, we're seeing them having traditional earlier-stage challenges and especially since they weren't born out of the cloud. They had different technologies that they've tried to slam together. That's really, really hard when you are looking at a customer who is looking for simplicity. Simplicity, efficacy, cost all those things really come into our wheelhouse. And so unless you were born in the cloud, you have that one single agent and you have that dynamic technology at the endpoint then you're already behind the eight ball. And so for us, I think that's a huge part of why you're seeing us put the numbers on the board that you're seeing. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it. And how universal would you describe the success competitively? Is it disproportionate with certain competitors? Or would you say it's pretty broad? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">It's definitely pretty broad. Like obviously, we've seen more of the Symantec trends and McAfees because their installation base was so much bigger. And then, so it really comes down to how big they are going in, in terms of how many customers they have, in terms of how many we're taking away and displacing. But we're seeing it even in the next-gen as I said. Like we're seeing that some of the next-gen folks that got gobbled up, it's tough right? When you're a company and you acquire a security company, this is not a commodity. It's not easy. </p>
<p class="p p4">I defer to you Walter you've been in the space as long or longer than me. I haven't really seen a successful security company been acquired and really smash it out of gates. It's really tough to do that. And so for us, we've been taking advantage of that, right? The integrations that aren't working for some of our competitors, the multi agents that they have that they're trying to slam together and their go-to-market, right? All those things are not just going to happen out of the gate. And so for us we've stayed true to how we've been successful and so far it's worked. </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it. Makes sense. And then when we start thinking about, I guess just the dollars involved there's to some degree a replacement sale that you're doing for some of these competitors. And then you're bringing -- you're obviously bringing more to the table. Otherwise the customer wouldn't be choosing you. They'd be sticking with what they have. </p>
<p class="p p4">Can you talk about sort of the typical sort of dollars to CrowdStrike on a deal that was primarily replacement with you bringing these additional technologies? And just trying to baseline sort of how we might think about the endpoint TAM for CrowdStrike versus what has traditionally been an endpoint TAM that some of these players have been a part of? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So first I'd like how you phrased it with endpoint TAM. So that's number one in the message we're trying to get across is that we're not just -- it's an endpoint security TAM. We are an endpoint TAM. And we've talked about it with -- even last quarter when we talked about our IT hygiene module that's in the SecOps world and how we're playing in that market as well. So for us, when we think about the rip and replace kind of that old type of phrase, the good news is that we're going into one of those customers and we're showing them the breadth of our lineup right. </p>
<p class="p p4">The 11 modules that we have to offer. So it's not just out of the gate, we're just replacing the prevention for example with a Symantec. </p>
<p class="p p4">I mean it's going to be a lot more than that. And that's what we're seeing across the board when we think about our module adoptions. </p>
<p class="p p4">We've reported the numbers and you've seen how strong they are in four and five-plus modules that are being adopted by our customers. A lot of those are new customers to us, right? A lot of those are coming out of the gate buying three, four or five modules all at once, right? That's their first purchase. So we're definitely seeing larger lands come into play. </p>
<p class="p p4">We're excited about that because we feel that we're offering more value to the customers. But the beauty is that we've still got a whole bunch of customers within our customer base that only have four and maybe only have five and we have that opportunity to sell in the fifth, sixth up to 11th today. And so what we're seeing out of the gate is larger bigger deals just on across the board. And that's because of this whole ability for us to show the consolidation of spend.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it, makes sense. And then how do we think about, on the cloud side. I think you've talked about 50% of your customers are using that product. That market is pretty early, lots of small players there. How should we think about -- I think, TAM is tougher to discuss there, but sort of, what those customers could mean for you from a dollar perspective, especially relative to what they're paying you for say, the endpoint suite of products?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yeah. No, that's a great question. And also I think that that is true Greenfield, right, the cloud workload opportunity. And I think Crowd's will -- in it is -- has been underappreciated, right? I mean, we talked about the fact that we protect over one billion unique container instances on a daily basis. And that business is growing.</p>
<p class="p p5">And you think about our earnings call, when we talked about Zoom, there's the quintessential cloud workloads that we're protecting. I see that, as a huge opportunity. I think, -- if you think about the traditional types of endpoints, whether it be a laptop server desktop, that represents x -- whatever x is of an opportunity in dollars.</p>
<p class="p p5">Well this could be 10x? I mean, it's hard to say where -- what that number is ultimately going to be. But the beauty is we're right there. And we're able to protect both. And how we price is also I get excited about. Because we're offering customers metered billing. So if they know they're going to use an instance. And it's only going to be up for a very short period of time great.</p>
<p class="p p5">Or we can offer packages, where there's a baseline. And you pay for that. So I think that the good news for us across the board is the fact that, there's this massive opportunity beyond just new modules. But it covers all of our customers. We've got a customer in play today, for example in terms of how -- trying to give you a sense of how big that market is.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">We got a customer that we're dealing with today where we came in -- it was a decent-sized customer about 150,000 traditional endpoints. And our sales rep went in there. And they actually saw that, they had one million workload opportunities. And he came back and said, "Well, okay, well, it's almost 10x what we thought it was going to be when we went in." And yes it was a technology company that we were dealing with.</p>
<p class="p p5">But you can see the power of what that multiplier effect could be, with respect to how many workloads we end up -- we can end up protecting. So that should give you an idea of the size and the scale that could be in front of us.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And how much can you leverage the -- you have these sort of suites that you go to market with in the endpoint space that are just kind of very logical progressions of additional functionality that you layer into the endpoint. The cloud sometimes can be a different buying center. Developers are involved. How much have you been able to leverage your existing sort of go-to-market channel? And your relationships on the endpoint side versus, how much of that is some element of a new sales cycle that new buyers and so forth?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">It's actually less so about new buyers, as opposed to new workloads to protect. The folks that are in charge of protecting from a security perspective, protecting the environment are the same whether it's in the cloud, whether it's a cloud workload, or whether it's a traditional endpoint.</p>
<p class="p p5">And it goes back to the company -- what are companies looking at? What's the outcome you're trying to solve? You're trying to solve to stop the breach, right? So the same people that are saying, "Hey, I'm out there protecting the breach from your traditional endpoints" are the same folks that need to protect the breach against, wherever your workloads are.</p>
<p class="p p5">And so the good news is, it's generally -- it's not in all cases. But for the most part, it's generally the same buyer. Where we see buyers being a little different, is the traditional security buyer versus the SecOps buyer. Those could be two different groups, IT ops versus security ops. But the good news is who likely in many cases they roll up to a CIO, for example.</p>
<p class="p p5">And the beauty is, when the CIO takes a look at the opportunity to save money with respect to consolidation, they get excited about buying more of those modules upfront, which is what we've been seeing. And so I think that's how to think about it, more than the cloud workloads versus the traditional laptop desktop server.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Got it. And how are you thinking about the, sort of mid-market, commercial customer opportunity versus the enterprise? And in the mid-markets channels are more important and so forth? How developed is your mid-market strategy? And how far down market, do you think you can go with your product line, as it relates to almost SMB and so forth?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">One of my favorite questions, because we sell to companies of all sizes, last quarter we had our second largest deal in company history with a low 8-figure deal. And in total, we landed 969 net new customers, which was a record for the company. And a lot of that volume comes from the mid-market and SMB space.</p>
<p class="p p6">So we're successful with companies of all sizes. What enables that is a true SaaS model that is easy to deploy and simple to manage. As a concrete example of that, our solution can be deployed 100% remotely and our agent doesn't even require a reboot. And I think that when we can do that we start to show the separation between us and others. I think that when you see -- competitively you see a company like Symantec, purposely abandoning customers in the mid-market and that will continue for years to come I think that we have that even more opportunities to seize the day in terms of that mid-market space.</p>
<p class="p p6">And to be fair, even when I got here which was about five years ago, we quickly embarked on the opportunity to go after the mid-market. When I got here the vast majority almost all of our deals were enterprise. And so we went into mid-market. We hired effectively. We hired a leader who knew how to get the mechanics and the muscle memory and the motion of how to sell to the market. And then we flighted our internal operations to take out friction in terms of how to go after mid-market, right? And that comes into the trial to pays or the in-app trials, where you've taken the friction out of the sales market -- the sales motion to enable us to go after that mid-market in a really, really effective way.</p>
<p class="p p6">Kind of like the sales wins model -- the sale win model except that we're continuously attached to the user, so we know what they're doing, when they're doing it, when they deploy, how they're deploying, what the percentage of the deployment is. We have all this additional information that allows us to follow up with our customer in a meaningful way. How can we help you? We see you having been fully deployed. Is there something that you want to use our help with? So all those bits and pieces of information help us to strengthen our relationship with our customers.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Got it. And related to channels and go-to-market on the cloud side, the hyperscalers obviously see all the workloads because that's where the workloads live. And they have marketplaces and so forth. How is the go-to-market side, especially as it relates to the channel different on the cloud side? And how successful have you been in terms of leveraging some of those potential partner relationships?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. So to date, we've been really successful with our channel group, right? We're a channel-first company as you know Walter. Most of our deals, the vast majority of our deals go through the channel. The only time that we don't is on the customer's request that they want to come direct. But most of our deals are through the channel. We're channel-friendly and we've seen obviously success and we've talked about our success with companies like AWS. But there are many others. We've got a very large VAR network and we've got great alignment with our team -- feet on the street as well as our executive involvement in the VARs to be able to help them to be available to them. And we nourish them and we pay for their performance. So I think that the ability for us to leverage the channel has been one of our competitive advantages.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">And because we're friendly to the channel, meaning that we're going to pay for the opportunities that they bring to us and we're going to pay for teaming efforts and we're going to pay for even if we -- even if they simply just help in the deployment that's all good for us. And as we continue to nourish and bring on more partners, we think about the fact that we've got this huge opportunity now with the Sis, right? So to date, we haven't had any of those big five SIs and we've been able to accomplish what we accomplished without that. But now that we're of a meaningful size, SIs of the world whether it's the big four or others in the accounting world, now they're starting to have more -- the deeper and more relevant conversations with us. And now it's just all about finding the way that we can both win when we go to market. So I see a great potential for us in the future to strengthen those relationships and become strong partners with those traditional large SIs.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Got it. And I guess I just -- one of the reads I had from your answer is you spent more time talking about the traditional partner channel as it related to cloud than necessarily the cloud service providers themselves. It sounds like the marketplace -- is the marketplace kind of a place you have to kind of advertise and drive some awareness, but it really does come down to that channel that knows your product best that has a relationship with the customers in security that is important in cloud still?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So I think obviously the relationships with our VARs that's a bigger piece of our go-to-market on the channel side. But clearly, the marketplace, the AWS Marketplace has been a big win for us. It continues to increase. And then, unlike many others who are in the AWS store or marketplace, we actually have such a strong relationship with AWS. We have actual quota requirement for the sales reps when they sell our stuff in the marketplace.</p>
<p class="p p7">So, there's added incentive for -- I don't know what the number is in terms of how many AWS folks are out there selling. But whatever it is and it's probably a big number that they're getting benefit when they sell CrowdStrike. So, I think, as that becomes more and more available and known to our customer base, I think you're going to see that grow and expand as well.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, got it. And then, as we think about the sort of forward-looking kind of product vision and so forth, what direction would you point us in terms of looking at, you have cloud, you have some of the endpoint areas outside of security and then obviously the endpoint security market has been strong for you. But, how should we think about where the focus of the -- maybe medium and long-term R&amp;D investment is?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So for us, we alluded to a little bit on our earnings call, where we talked about this whole notion of zero trust. That complements well with some of the identity folks. It complements well with what we have. And so, we think that that's an opportunity for us for sure. And we think about -- beyond that, we think about areas like compliance, right? I think that we've got an opportunity in the compliance space.</p>
<p class="p p7">And then of course, we think that there are more opportunities in the adjacencies to security in the IT ops space. We just -- we've only had our first module in there, and I think that there's a bunch more that we can go after. And I think there's all of that. And I think that for us on the R&amp;D side, I think there's opportunity for us to continue to expand the TAMs with respect to some of the things that haven't been done well in the space to begin with.</p>
<p class="p p7">I mean the overall security space DLP, right? I don't -- I haven't seen something that really excites me in that space. That's something that we're looking at as well. I think, so there's a lot of still potential for us to really allow for further consolidation within the security space.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Got it. Question came in on the line just around the web submission around, specifically competitively with Palo Alto's XDR product. I mean that product hasn't been in the market that long. But what are you seeing relative to that product competitively?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. So Palo Alto, kudos to them for being able to be the firewall company, but that's how they're built, right? From their technology to their go-to-market, and they've done a great job in displacing their incumbents.</p>
<p class="p p8">XDR, I think this is new as you said. It's really hard to start combining different technologies network and endpoint. I'm unfamiliar with one that has done it successfully, right? It's a different go-to-market. It's a different technology.</p>
<p class="p p8">It's smashing things together, has never really worked in our space, Walter, as you know. No one's really done it successfully. And so, kudos for them to trying and take a stab at it. Time will tell if it's being -- if they're going to be successful. But, I'm thinking about that as that's a long and complicated road.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Got it. Got it. Yes. Okay, makes sense. And then, relative to your sales and marketing efficiency, I mean you've talked about this Magic Number, and it's trended actually I guess more favorably than you've talked about sort of managing it too. Can you help us understand maybe how you use that number? And given how strong sort of the efficiency is implied by that sort of how should we think about your sales and marketing spend over the next few quarters?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So, we're going to continue to aggressively spend. There's no doubt, right? The 1.3 in Magic Number is just one of those efficiency metrics we look at, and it's telling us you have room to spend and we are. So, our hiring plan is even greater than pre-COVID. And specifically in key areas, it's well above where we were pre-COVID.</p>
<p class="p p8">And certainly the over-performance in Q1 and Q2 has allowed for that. The efficiency that we're seeing we think that 1.3, it's the highest we've ever seen for a Magic Number. We think that can trend downwards, and we'd still be in a great place. And here's how it works.</p>
<p class="p p8">So basically the sales force goes out there, sales and marketing that come together with their capacity planning, what they're going to need to support that capacity. Then they come to my team and we work together on the unit economics and make sure that they're within a band. Clearly they've fallen within that band.</p>
<p class="p p8">And so now, what we can do is we can say, okay guys, let's figure out where we think there are some opportunities. Where do we want to double down? Is it a sector? Is it -- like for example, it could be healthcare. Is it somewhere else where we would do some overlay? How do we want to think about that cloud? Like, do we want to go after that in a different way? And we're able to deploy and come to a point where we think that we can meaningfully move our magic number and still be extremely efficient. So that's how we think about it today. We're going to continue to aggressively invest S&amp;M, R&amp;D.</p>
<p class="p p8">We're excited about our opportunities in terms of what has been given to us with respect to the competitive environment as well as being able to attract the best folks that are out there to come and work with us as well as to keep those that are here excited and in their seat.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">And can you talk about one of the sort of inputs into that number ultimately is the productivity of reps that you're hiring today that will impact that number as we look towards future quarters. Where are you getting your sales reps from? And especially given the environment we're in, what sort of ramp time do you see with sales reps versus what you've seen in the past getting them up to speed and so forth?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. No, that's a terrific question. So, traditionally, we've seen most of our hiring coming from the security folks that are already out there the incumbents a lot of those folks come in. But clearly it's been expanded to software. As we continue to grow and bring in more and more folks, we're looking for folks that have enterprise B2B experience. They're clearly coming from software folks that really are passionate about security. They want to do -- they want to be able to be in a spot where they're doing more than just coming to work and printing code. They want to know that that -- what they're doing is actually stopping the bad guys, doing something that is altruistic.</p>
<p class="p p9">So they're coming in from all areas of software and traditional security for sure. And I think that what we're seeing in terms of the folks that want to come join us, they all come with a skill set. What we're seeing which is important to us is our mission-critical nature of what we do. And if you don't have a sales hat on to be able to think about, hey, who am I going to be able to benefit from what we're offering? Then you're probably not going to be successful here.</p>
<p class="p p9">So everybody comes in with a particular skill set whatever it is, pick a line whether it's engineering, whether it's sales, obviously, sales. But if it's even in finance and my group we're always thinking about who we can connect the dots to be able to accelerate the sales, especially now with the work-from-home or work from anywhere where the sales team doesn't necessarily have that opportunity to go to dinners and to go to events and golfing and all that kind of stuff that has worked to really enhance relationships.</p>
<p class="p p9">They've got to go back to their inside sales rep days, where they're pounding the phones and they're leveraging our ever-increasing employee base. And so we pay folks SPIFFs if they are able to help a lead and they're not even in sales. So they obviously don't have quotas. But we do all the right things to bring in new deals into our pipeline and help the sales folks close them.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Got it. Got it. And as you think about the evolution of the sales organization, I mean, some companies go through verticalization, some go through sort of named accounts where they have half a dozen or 10 accounts that they just really try to drive revenue in. What are sort of the natural progressions of your sales organization structure? And how far along are you in putting in some of those evolutions?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. That actually is a great question near and dear to my heart, because I've worked closely with the sales team as you know. We're already at that point where we've got certain sales reps who have been here a while who are very efficient in what they do having named accounts. So we already have a named account structure.</p>
<p class="p p9">We obviously have a structure that's based on a territory. And then we've assigned quotas respectively. So not only territories within the United States, obviously, but internationally. So for us, as we think about our aggressive hiring plan that we have in front of us, it's about named accounts, it's about overlays, certain of our accounts in certain sectors, health care industry, they're in the limelight right now. They need to be protected to think about the overlay team that goes into specifically relationship-driven focused that's where we're going to spend money.</p>
<p class="p p9">And then the evolution of that obviously overlays the -- at some point the overlay goes away, right? And it becomes an actual sector by itself. And so that's kind of the next phase of our evolution is to kind of break out some of the overlay teams and be more focused in a specific sector or a specific group of companies.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Got it. Got it. I did want to remind folks I've gotten in a couple of questions here that I've incorporated into the discussion we're having. But if anybody has additional questions put those into the question submission there and we can use them. So, I guess, on an area that we haven't spent much time talking about you really haven't been that active is around acquiring anything and using that to, sort of, boost the breadth of the platform, and just curious how you're thinking about that topic generally. What sort of, profile of company small large would you look at? And how much does the team spend? How much time does the team spend thinking about moving the ball forward with inorganic moves?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes. So clearly we – obviously, we haven't done anything yet as a public company. We did do M&amp;A when we were a private company so we do have some of the muscle memory required to do that. And what we did pre public is we brought people in tech right and we put them on our platform. And I think that that would probably be the most likely higher -- the M&amp;A that we would look at in the near future I think as our first M&amp;A. And we're constantly talking to companies all the time about different techs that kind of could enhance what we have or can add a new TAM to us.</p>
<p class="p p10">We're constantly talking to them. But it's more likely than not as our first M&amp;A activity that we would do -- would probably be similar to that. We wouldn't be going out there and buying $1 billion company. That's more unlikely. I'm not saying it's not going to happen, but it's more unlikely just because we want to -- we've been successful at those smaller types of acquisitions as a private company we probably want to stick close to what we know.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes. Got it. Makes sense. And then another question on similar to that from a go-to-market perspective one of the I guess it appears as though you've been pretty successful leveraging breach response and sort of being the thought leader around what's driving breaches and so forth into product sales. We've seen companies some companies in the past try to do that. You know it FireEye comes to mind having bought Mandiant and we just saw Palo Alto buy a company with a very clearly articulated strategy around leveraging breach response into product sales. How -- I guess how much of a driver has that been for your business? And let's start there and then I have a couple of follow-ups.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Great. Yes. No. So that's actually been -- it's our strongest lead gen to-date. I think that when we started the company, we started it with always knowing we're going to be a product company, but we actually started with the -- on the services side of the house. And over time you've seen through the numbers that it's a small percent of our business with respect to the overall revenue. But it's our strongest lead gen. It's one of those that we've talked about in the past about how much a new ACV services deal how much that brings in -- in terms of net new ARR. And it was -- for every dollar we would bring in $3.73 and we've seen a steady increase in that ratio over the quarters. And that's never going to go away from us.</p>
<p class="p p10">But that's hard, right? I mean if it's not built from the beginning and you don't have a mentality from the services team thinking that we're here to be that lead gen to our tech it becomes really, really difficult. And so if you take our style versus Mandiant -- Mandiant they'll come in and they'll stay there. And they're going to stay there and be -- try to be a trusted adviser in there for a long time. Whereas for us we'll come in somebody else's tech failed, we'll come in we'll clean it up. And then our whole strategy is to leave our product behind which is very different, right? And we've been really successful with that.</p>
<p class="p p10">The Palo Alto acquisition, we're familiar with some of those folks. It just doesn't work right out of the gate and might not never work. It's kind of like smashing technologies together. Because the services team they need to leverage the tool, they need to build their own muscle memory about how your tool works. And it's just because you're going to buy a bunch of folks doesn't mean that that is immediately going to plug and play. And so we understand why they did it. They saw the success that we had. Again sometimes they look -- something looks similar, smells similar, but it tastes very different. And so you have to see how that plays out. But again it goes back to the hey, if you haven't started and built from scratch that -- whole motion together it's going to be hard to do.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Yes. Agreed. Agreed. One question actually, I think, maybe our final one here that came in on the submission is a follow-up to last quarter. You've been very consistent in disclosing ARR so I think we can see those numbers. The question was around billings. The billings growth trend was lower than you've seen in recent trend line. Can you help us understand what drove that billings performance this quarter versus what you've seen in the past?</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Yes, sure. So first, let's start with in fact -- you know it Walter but maybe some of your audience doesn't. We don't run our business based on billings, which has been what other companies do. I mean we've purposely decided to give out ARR or Annual Recurring Revenue because that really is the driver in terms of what is the health of the business. That's going to tell you, how we're doing.</p>
<p class="p p11">With respect to the billings giving a proxy for a proxy to get to revenue doesn't make sense to us. Billings in and of itself can be extremely misleading. For example, this quarter, billings, remember is just an aftereffect of what you've already sold, right? And there are many things that can drive how that can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, right? So it could be – there are things like timing of when the subscription starts or it could be how many multiyear deals you brought in house in a particular quarter.</p>
<p class="p p11">So there are a variety of things that could impact or whipsaw that number and it might not even be a true honest reflection of the business like this quarter. This was our most outstanding quarter-to-date in terms of net new ARR. And that's how we pay our sales force, that's how we compensate our sales force, that's how we run our business. But the fact that, our billings growth rate wasn't the same as others could be misleading. And so we don't ignore it, because it's bringing the cash in – but on the one hand.</p>
<p class="p p11">On the other hand, it's one of those things that we just don't want our business on. And that's how we look at other things besides ARR like RPO, which is the sum of our deferred and our backlog. That grew over – that almost doubled year-over-year. So you take those things into consideration in conjunction and you kind of recognize that billings for us isn't probably the best metric to look at. And because we're giving out ARR folks have gravitated towards that metric as the one to look at us as the cleanest metric to decide, how well the company is actually doing.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Got it. Okay. Okay. I think Burt with that, we're going to – we've reached time and it has been a good discussion. I just want to leave it to you anything else you want to make sure you get across that we didn't cover in the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Burt Podbere</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">I think we've done a – Walter I think your questions were spot on and your audience was spot on. I think the one thing I would leave everybody with is this. I think we've been underappreciated in terms of what we can do in the cloud. I think when we talked about on the earnings call what we did with Zoom and others. I think hopefully highlights our capabilities in that area and the huge opportunity that's in front of us.</p>
<p class="p p11">That goes along with what we talked about at the onset with the security transformation is that prerequisite to the digital transformation in this distributed environment that we're in. Those are the two themes that, I'd love to make sure, I leave with your audience.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Walter Pritchard</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Got it. Great. Well, Burt thanks a lot for joining. And thanks to the whole CrowdStrike team for enabling it and everybody else for joining on. We'll be continuing on these sessions and Burt we hope to see you soon.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Burt Podbere</strong></p>
