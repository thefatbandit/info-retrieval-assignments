<p class="p p1"><strong>Larry Biegelsen</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">All right. Good morning, everyone. I'm Larry Biegelsen, the medical device analyst at Wells Fargo. It's my pleasure to host this session with Johnson &amp; Johnson. With us we have Mathai Mammen, who is the Global Head of R&amp;D for the Pharmaceuticals business. In terms of format, it's going to be a fireside chat for 30 minutes. We're going to try to do a polling question here. Worked well this morning, so we're going to do another one. So Mathai, welcome and thanks so much for joining us virtually this morning. Can you hear me okay?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Mathai Mammen</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">I can, Larry. Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure. </p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Larry Biegelsen</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. Mathai, I thought we'd start with a big picture -- a couple of big picture questions on J&amp;J's Pharmaceutical business, which has been so successful in the recent few years. So, J&amp;J's diversified business model has helped you to weather the current pandemic and the Pharma business is [Technical Difficulty] as well. If we look at the first half of 2020, Pharma sales grew about 7% on underlying basis. How has the pandemic impacted the J&amp;J Pharma business? And what's the [Technical Difficulty] in your full year outlook in that business?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. It's a great question. Thanks, Larry. I do want to just start out by saying I have to acknowledge the many people, the 130,000 people in J&amp;J, its employees and the many, many people in the world that are on the suffering side of this global pandemic. So it's been a tremendous challenge. And it's needed us to dig deep and remember like why we're doing what we're doing to continue thriving in this era. And I understand that that's true for many, many people. So I just want to acknowledge that before I begin.</p>
<p class="p p1">Really excited to be here representing J&amp;J's pharmaceutical business. We know, as I just alluded to, that sickness doesn't stop because of COVID-19, other sickness. So people have cancer people face mental health challenges, have autoimmune diseases. And all these people, all these patients depend on our medicines every day. So it's in recognition of that that we have pulled out all the stops.</p>
<p class="p p1">I can speak confidently for the R&amp;D organization, the supply chain organization, commercial organization to say that's true. There's such a commitment here that we pulled out literally all the stops to keep things going and growing. And I'm happy to report that the growth that we have comes exclusively from growth in volume from the number of medicines that are prescribed, not by raising price. So any sales growth that we're seeing makes us happy, because it means that we're increasing the number of patients that we're reaching. And when that happens, it has a direct feedback on us to try even harder and keep going.</p>
<p class="p p1">So we have strong second quarter results. It's the ninth quarter in a row where we had sales exceeding $10 billion. In Q1, you'll remember that we did see a roughly 100 basis points net positive impact globally and we think this is due to longer scripts being written. So these are 90-day versus 30 or 60-day scripts. We're really happy to see that.</p>
<p class="p p1">In Q2, as we shared in our July 16 earnings call, we did see roughly a 300, 350 basis point negative impact due to COVID on six products: DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, INVEGA, SUSTENNA, TREMFYA, the pulmonary hypertension portfolio and STELARA. And this was the result of destocking from Q1 or delayed in certain new patient starts, just particularly in certain areas where they needed to go see a physician in a healthcare center and they had worries about doing that given the pandemic.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">So, as we shared, we've seen significant improvements now in office visits, since the peak of the pandemic. We're not quite back to where we were pre-COVID, but the recovery is going well, even though it's not expected to be quite linear. We should see some level of remaining impact I think on the second half of the year, but we're doing really well. And I feel very confident that our portfolio will continue to grow above market in 2020.</p>
<p class="p p2">So, in R&amp;D specifically, despite COVID-19, as I've said, we've tried many things that were in the hopper to try, but we -- to me it's a positive in that COVID-19 was a catalyst. It made something go from nice-to-have, very nice-to-have, to must-have. So, we changed our tactics on how to collect evidence remotely to deliver drugs that normally would need to be received with patients coming into a clinic. We've got them to the patient directly. We did iPad interviews instead of live interviews. So, lots of good stuff has happened, much of which we'll retain going forward.</p>
<p class="p p2">No regulatory bodies have indicated anything, but support and we have no known delays in the 2020 time frame. In fact, we had a number of approvals in the first half of the year. And several were ahead of the PDUFA dates that we've been communicating. So these include TREMFYA for psoriatic arthritis in the U.S.; DARZALEX subcutaneous, this is FASPRO. We're super excited about that and that's come through in the U.S. and Europe, IMBRUVICA, so frontline for CLL combo with rituximab both in the U.S. and Europe. Really happy about that.</p>
<p class="p p2">So following the Q2 earnings call, we also received approval in the U.S. for our second indication of SPRAVATO to treat depressive symptoms in adults with depression, major depressive disorder that have acute suicidal ideation. This is an extremely, extremely important medical need right now that has basically nothing. So, we're honored to provide that indication to the world.</p>
<p class="p p2">We also saw in -- since the earnings call, DARZALEX in combination with KYPROLIS carfilzomib and dexamethasone. This is DKD for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. So -- and finally, we expect to file our BCMA CAR-T in multiple myeloma in the U.S. We also expect to file our EGFR cMET product for non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. and the paliperidone palmitate six months formulation for schizophrenia in the U.S. and Europe before the end of the year. So, as you can see, we're very much on track. We've changed our tactics in order to remain on track and we're -- I'm really happy with how the business is doing overall.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">That's great to hear. Let's spend some time on the vaccine. Obviously, a lot of interest in that for obvious reasons I think. Mathai, maybe just --- could you remind us about the key development milestones and data releases? I think, we expect to see initial Phase I human data in September, October and maybe Phase II data in late 2020. What are the time lines here?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. No thank you for that. I speak as both a developer of this vaccine and as a citizen, right? We're all awaiting this vaccine. We're super motivated. And here too, we have a very proud vaccine team that's been working constantly for the last six months to make this happen.</p>
<p class="p p2">So just as a reminder, we took a very disciplined, very scientific approach to this vaccine. We've made a number of antigen constructs variants and we went through a series of studies including sophisticated animal models where we went down to one antigen and we took this forward through a very good rigorous, but fast time line to get into Phase I in July 21.</p>
<p class="p p2">And as you said, it's around now like, it's imminent that we should be looking very shortly at Phase I data. The main thing we look at in those data are immunogenicity. So both the antibody side of things looking at neutralization of naturally occurring coronavirus in an in vitro assay.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">So wild-type neutralizing titer so to speak. As well we look at aspects of the T cell response. So one important aspect is the Th1, the Th2 lean. We want it to be Th1. And second is that we have good levels of both CD4 and CD8-positive T cells. So all of this is what we're looking for today.</p>
<p class="p p3">And if we see all of that and we don't see too much influence over other subsets of the population like age and other demographics then we would go forward into Phase III. We've said September. I'm hoping it is September, but we'll take the time that we need to get this exactly right. But I'm still remaining hopeful that we'll start a Phase III study in September.</p>
<p class="p p3">This is a registrational program that's aimed at both potential for emergency use authorization if the data are very compelling, but full approval and a submission of a BLA for full approval. And we don't know -- to directly answer your question around time lines, we and other companies have far more uncertainty on the finish date of this trial in COVID-19.</p>
<p class="p p3">There probably any other trial I've ever been involved with professionally and that's because it's an event-driven trial. And the number of events are driven by the local incidence rate in the place we're doing the trial. And this pandemic is moving around like crazy like it pops up. It lasts like a couple of months, disappears, pops up again sometimes in the second wave, pops up somewhere else.</p>
<p class="p p3">So we are doing our very best using data and predictive analytics to try to predict where it will come. But there are so many human elements to this as well like behavior, policy changes that's really challenging. So we've done our very best by covering our bases and we're hopeful that hopefully early next year something like that we should have enough events to have confidence that we have a safe and effective vaccine.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">That's helpful. So it sounds like Phase I human data, we could see that in September. Is that a press release publication? What's the venue?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. So for me as a rigorous person I do want us to publish the bulk of our data through scientific channels. So this would be like a rapidly reviewed but nevertheless rigorously reviewed publication. Now we will say something about the top line that we're confident around the dimensions that I just named around cellular and humoral immunity and safety of course. But we probably won't release a lot of details through press releases, but we'll wait for a publication.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So we could get top line results in a -- from a press release. It's quickly followed by a period with publication?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. I think that's right.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And one other question on your program, I think you've said you're going to study 60,000 patients in the Phase III study. The competitors Pfizer and Moderna are doing 30,000 patients. Why are you doing 60,000?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. No, that's a fantastic question. We are a little bit behind AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna. They've been collecting events now. And as you -- both of us read in the news and see in the media, the event rates are pretty high right now. The incidence rates are pretty high right now.</p>
<p class="p p3">Our predictive analytics has a couple of different factors that are very important that make us need a larger number of subjects just to ensure that we have timely delivery of the right number of events to have confidence that the vaccine works.</p>
<p class="p p3">One is that the seroprevalence is going up. So, a larger number of subjects in the world have had COVID-19. And that's more true in late Q4 than it is true in Q3. The other is that people are finding ways right through policy and behavior of controlling this infection more protecting their vulnerable populations, like the elderly.</p>
<p class="p p3">The use of masks right now is no longer seen as like not useful, but useful. So, a lot of behaviors have improved. So, we just think the incidence rates, at least for moderate to severe consequences of the infection, which is what we're measuring, will drop a little bit in Q4 relative to Q3.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">So in order to finish in the same amount of time, given it's an event-based study we need more subjects. We never said that we'll do all 60,000, but up to 60,000 it gives us the latitude to go to the number we need in order to have a timely completion.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">That's helpful. And of course, I wanted to ask you about the AstraZeneca trial pause that was announced last night. Any comments on that, confidence in your safety profile?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. So, AstraZeneca, a great company. Mene Pangalos, a fantastic leader did exactly what we would do. If you see something in a trial, in any phase of trial with an abundance of caution, you always look make sure that there's nothing untoward going on, put new instructions, new precautions in the trial potentially if warranted and you continue.</p>
<p class="p p4">This in fact -- I don't think -- normally trials are not paid this close attention to. Pauses like this or self-folds, which is what I understand this is happens all the time with good companies, with cautious companies that are always looking and learning from their trials.</p>
<p class="p p4">We don't see anything like this in our own product right now. We're happy that our platform Ad26 has been in over 90,000 people in the world. And so far, it's a really good profile, really good safety profile.</p>
<p class="p p4">And so, -- but we will, like everyone else right now, move forward with great care and caution and look carefully at all the subjects that will begin to enroll in our own Phase 3 study. In our Phase 1 study, we haven't seen anything untoward like this.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">That's helpful. And Paul Stoffels, at J&amp;J, had said that the company is aiming for 70% efficacy with its vaccine. Where did that number come from? And what's your confidence in being able to produce, let's say, effective vaccine today?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So, I would characterize the 70% as more an assumption than an aspiration. We're not aiming for 70%. We're assuming a 70% efficacy, when thinking of how to power our study. So, if we assumed 50%, we would have to enroll a much larger number of subjects. If we enrolled -- if we assumed 100%, we would enroll a fewer number of subjects.</p>
<p class="p p4">So, we aimed for this, because that's a reasonable assumption based on everyone's data. So everyone's assumed something in and around that at the moment in order to power their study. Everyone including us, we're hoping for as good as we could possibly do. And there are clear -- very clear guidelines from FDA for what the efficacy and the variance and that efficacy estimate needs to be for an approval.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">And your confidence level today?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So based on all the non-human primate data which is what we're looking at right now, the optimization we've done, the great science we've applied it's really good. Now I will sleep better once we look at the full load of Phase I/IIa data that I alluded to a few minutes ago that's coming in now.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. Let's go to the first -- or the second polling question here, Josh which is on the COVID vaccine. Curious to get the audience's take on that. Josh?</p>
<p class="p p4">All right. So when do you expect a safe and effective -- and effective we mean greater than 50% efficacy because that's the bar that the FDA has set on COVID vaccine to be widely available in the U.S. And so you have some of the dates here. Curious to get the audience's response. We'll give people about 30 seconds, 20 seconds we'll see. Josh, let us know when things stop coming in.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Sounds good.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Mathai are you voting? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I voted. </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">You voted? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">All right. I think that's -- I got a couple of people still going in but you got a large portion of them. </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. What do we have? Early 2021 -- mid-2021. Okay, fairly optimistic. Zero Percent never. That's surprising to me. Mathai any reaction to what you see here?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">I think that's in line with my own expectation. Q1 2021, I think, is a reasonable estimate for vaccines to come forward and be available for people. And that is a result of both the clinical development time lines and the manufacturing time lines. I think it will be later in 2021 when it's available to a large mass of people in the world and earlier in 2021 when select populations get vaccinated.</p>
<p class="p p5">The never is interesting. I think that everyone is trying some version of a spike protein as far as I know right now. And so there is a degree of dependent risk. So something is non-immunogenic about spike protein, which I don't believe based on the data we've seen so far from even other companies then that would be a problem, but that's not the situation right now. So I'm in agreement with the never being very low probability.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. Well, that's encouraging. Let's move on to your -- to the other parts of your business starting with oncology. I wanted to ask about CAR-T cell therapy. J&amp;J licenses you're filing that I think in the U.S. later this year. J&amp;J licensed in JNJ-4528 from Legend Biotech for treating recurrent multiple myeloma. And my first question is how is 528 differentiated from other BCMA CAR-T therapies like Bluebirds?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. So why don't I go back to the original reason we did the deal with Legend. We were extremely excited by the data that was first presented at ASCO. Second is we did deep diligence with the Legend Company. We realized that this product is very special. It has -- instead of a typical binding element that targets the T cell the CAR-T to its tumor, it has a bidentate binding.</p>
<p class="p p5">So these are two binders that can bite or grab hold of BCMA very rapidly, very potently. And so, we think that that is a differentiator. And if you look at the clinical data, then you see that playing up. Like we have some really good data that, we continue to collect. The depth of the fact is really strong, in terms of complete remissions -- responses rather. And we see that the durability of that complete response is really long.</p>
<p class="p p5">So we're obviously not done, until we have all the clinical data collected and continue to look at, this durability measure. But we're incredibly excited by what we see. In fact I don't think I've seen as good clinical data in my professional career, given the state of the patients that were treated, as this. So I'm incredibly excited by what we see right now, with our product. And we'll continue again to evolve the data set. And the longer we go, hopefully the more excited we get, because the durability will continue to be there.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">That's helpful. My impression is that, a lot of the Street models don't -- are not giving J&amp;J a lot of credit for 4,528. Can you talk about the initial market opportunity? And how you see that evolving over time?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yeah. So I'll address that only in that we're doing our trials, in later-stage lines right now. And the way we see that is, we want that to be the preferred late-line therapy for treating multiple myeloma, once the initial slew of medicines have been used and unfortunately for a portion of those patients won't have managed to clear the cancer. And so these are for those patients. And that's where we will begin.</p>
<p class="p p5">We will see about broader populations and creeping up the lines, as we go, as we establish dose and safety, and efficacy, and durability. And we compare to alternatives that multiple myeloma patients will have, before becoming -- before being right at the end of the line. And then, -- so we see great opportunity for patients. We see great opportunity for the business, in continuing to evolve the product.</p>
<p class="p p5">That said, we're not -- this is not a one shot on goal. We have additional multiple myeloma therapies, that we're actively working on in the pipeline. These include other CAR-T therapies, but they also importantly include our own version of a CD3 redirector or bispecific sometimes called, where these are single proteins that have two binding elements. One binds to BCMA, like our CAR-T cell, but instead of the CAR-T being a T cell, this has a CD3 element that grabs hold of T cells -- hold T cells and bring those through that binding mechanism, to the tumor.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">And those have certain advantages and disadvantages. And our own BCMA CD3 bispecific it has an evolving and very nice data set coming along as well. We see these coexisting in the marketplace, by being used in slightly different places. It could be that, the simplicity of treatment, and effect makes the CD3 BCMA redirector, more appropriate in earlier lines less sick. And so that's one way we're thinking of it right now. And then the other, non-BCMA therapies for multiple myeloma, they are for patients where BCMA is not going to be the final solution.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. That's very helpful. Let's – we have about five minutes left. Let's talk about immunology, which is your largest franchise by revenue. And you just announced an acquisition of Momenta a few weeks ago. What was the strategic rationale for the deal? And what gets you most excited about their lead compound nipocalimab? Hopefully, I'm sure, I mispronounced that. But –</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Nipocalimab, it's a very exciting product. Momenta, first of all, fabulous group of people have done a first-class job developing as a company and a portfolio and this product or this molecule nipocalimab in particular just a first-grade job. And so what this is, is it's a treatment for autoantibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. So there's the world of autoimmune diseases, which is very large and we're trying our best as other companies are through mostly cytokine antagonists. So, anti-TNFs, anti IL-12/23 and STELARA TREMFYA and anti-IL-23, those all target the part of the pathology the sickness that is mediated by these cytokines.</p>
<p class="p p6">There's a whole separate part of the pathology in sometimes exclusively, sometimes a component of autoimmune diseases that might be mediated by autoantibodies. Autoantibodies are antibodies that are generated against your own self, against your own proteins. And these, if they come into existence start damaging the cells and tissues on which these proteins exist. And that's obviously really bad. As they go – undergo constant stimulation more and more of your antibody pool your IgG pool starts to be represented by autoantibodies and that's when you get really sick.</p>
<p class="p p6">And so for diseases like myasthenia gravis, certain autohemolytic anemias, other diseases that – there are actually a host of these, they're predominantly driven by these IgGs. FcRn, if you antagonize it cuts out a major system that retains those IgGs in the body and allows them to be cleared more quickly, if you antagonize FcRn. So by dropping that IgG load you take out a lot of pathology-causing autoantibodies.</p>
<p class="p p6">We see this as incredibly exciting, because there is no treatment for the autoantibody component of any autoimmune disease. So we will begin by looking at diseases that are exclusively driven by autoantibodies, where there's evidence of that today, move to diseases that maybe exclusively driven by our antibody diseases, and move from there to many autoimmune diseases, where I believe that autoantibodies play some role, an important role like a disease – I won't go into examples right now, but there are many diseases where autoantibodies probably play an important role in addition to non-autoantibodies.</p>
<p class="p p6">So that's part of the excitement of nipocalimab. And that drove the deal that we did to acquire or in the process of acquiring Momenta. They also happen to have given a lot of thought and effort to other ways of intervening with autoantibody-driven diseases. It's an entire pathway area stronghold to use our own nomenclature. The entire company works on that pathway. So they hadn't -- those products having yet risen to a point where we throw everything at it. They are pre-proof-of-concept in my mind. But there's a lot of potential there that could offer upside to the deal.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Great. We're almost out of time, but I want to sneak in one more question. And I'll just ask a big picture question. Other than the -- pretty standard question for someone responsible for R&amp;D. But what -- other than the COVID vaccine, what are the two to three products that you're most excited about? What are the products that maybe aren't getting a lot of attention from investors in J&amp;J's pipeline that you think we should be paying closer attention to, that you're excited about?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Mathai Mammen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yeah. So, it's difficult to pick and choose, just two and three honestly Larry. Like, we've done a lot of work on this pipeline in the last three years. We've exited products that we don't believe are, going to be strongly differentiated and offer patients something unique. We brought in and accelerated from our own internal work products that we think are really sharply differentiated.</p>
<p class="p p7">And we build on products that are near-term opportunities for patients. This includes, as I mentioned, DARZALEX FASPRO, the subcutaneous DARZALEX. It would include TREMFYA of course, which we're rapidly investing in, in both the ordinary like the big indications that everyone knows about, like that we have with STELARA.</p>
<p class="p p7">But also we're asking the question -- and this may be underappreciated, we're asking the question where else IL-23 plays a very strong role in disease, analogous to what I mentioned about FcRn and autoantibodies. And then we're coming up with a number of diseases, where we're going to try the use of TREMFYA. And this is really exciting for us as we plow forward.</p>
<p class="p p7">The third one that I think may be underappreciated as well is BALVERSA. This is our FGFR inhibitor. What we've done now is, we've expanded beyond the urothelial bladder cancer which is a very important, but small-ish market, important for those patients, but more broadly in two directions. One is go heavily deep into bladder cancer.</p>
<p class="p p7">We did an acquisition of a company called Taris, which gives us access to a slow delivery -- sustained delivery device that you can put right in the bladder. And we want to cure bladder cancer if we can through sustained activity that BALVERSA basically catalyzed.</p>
<p class="p p7">And the second direction is going to tumor tissue-agnostic mode where we look at everywhere in the body. And we're running a trial now where certain FGFR mutations are driving the cancer. So maybe those are three off the top of my head Larry.
