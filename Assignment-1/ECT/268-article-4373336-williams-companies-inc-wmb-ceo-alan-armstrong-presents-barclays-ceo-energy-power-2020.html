<p class="p p1"><strong>Christine Cho</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the second day of the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference. And thank you for joining my next chat with Alan Armstrong, President and CEO of The Williams Companies. Hi, Alan. How are you this morning?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Alan Armstrong</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Hey. Good morning. Great. Christine, how are you doing?</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Christine Cho</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good. Not bad. So, I thought we would go over a list of questions in this new virtual format. And so, maybe if we can start with something topical that's been in the news lately. The cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Williams is not a stranger to getting pipelines canceled due to permitting issues. But, the customers here on Atlantic Coast were actually -- are actually some of your existing customers who are looking to diversify their supply even if it came out of much higher cost? So with the regulatory backdrop only getting more difficult, what is the opportunity for you here? How well positioned are you to serve the load that ACP would have served?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Alan Armstrong</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Well, thank you, Christine. And certainly something we've been keeping our eye on for quite some time. We have been and remain very well positioned to serve those loads. If you look closely Transco map, you’ll notice that we have two laterals that go over into that area, one we call the Virginia South lateral, which of course is in the south, spread along the Virginia and North Carolina border, and the other is the Cardinal line, which runs into North Carolina. And so, both of those laterals already exist and they go into a lot of the areas that needed to be expanding to.</p>
<p class="p p1">And of course, previously, there really was kind of three motives there I think for ACP. One was to bring a diversity of supply and in other words, of pipeline of operations into that area. Two was of course the economic motives of the sponsors because they were investing in the pipeline capacity themselves rather than letting somebody else make that return. And then, of course, and I think wound up being the most difficult and important of the issues was environmental impact associated with the construction of the project. And so, those really were -- just like in any project, those were primary considerations. And as you know, they certainly pushed hard on the supply disruption -- I'm sorry, on the supply diversity issue in their filings with the state. But at the end of the day, the environmental opposition was just too strong and too difficult right away.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, we remain extremely well positioned to serve those loads via our existing system at a much lower cost than what was available previously, and because we have the ability to just expand right within our existing system to serve a lot of that load. So, we're excited about the opportunity and certainly, working closely with the potential shippers there and feel like we are well-positioned to help serve that load for the future.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Christine Cho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">And just kind of moving along the lines of the regulatory backdrop that's been very challenging. With all of this difficulty in building new pipe, do you think that increases the value of pipe in the ground, or does that essentially cap production growth of the U.S., because how else are we going to get it to market, and that -- all of the companies that -- do that like the risk premiums going up? How do you think about that?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Alan Armstrong</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Well, we certainly have been -- if you look at the projects that we've been developing, we've been stopped on two of our projects on the interstate gas systems, and that really was constitution and NESE are the two that -- and both of those were not related to really interstate or environmental issues, they really were just a policy perspective by the state of New York. And so, -- but beyond that, we've continued to build a lot of projects and expansions along the Transco system, both for LNG exports as well as a lot of continued coal-to-gas conversion, power generation backup in our markets as well as continuing to take fuel oil out of markets up in the Northeast, which, of course, were higher emissions.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">So, we have really been pretty fortunate with the number of projects that we've been able to develop. We've got Leidy South that is getting really close. We've received the Corps of Engineers 404 permit as well as the State of Pennsylvania's 401 on Leidy South. So, we're moving ahead very rapidly on that project. That's a little under 600 million a day of new expansion capacity that serves the northern part of the Marcellus, and particularly serves Susquehanna and Cabot as a customer. And so, we're excited about the way that project's gone. Regional Energy Access, we think is another good example of projects that will serve that area and using existing infrastructure to accomplish that. And of course, Southeastern Trail, you know I haven't heard much about it but that project has been going on really well. And we had a little bit of looping to do and quite a bit of compressor addition to do along the system, but that project is well-ahead of schedule and well under budget. So, it's kind of those things you don't hear about they're going very well, and you hear about the things that aren't going well. But, our expansions are going pretty well along our system. And we really don't see much reason as long as we're staying along our existing right of ways, we don't really see much reason that those projects will be stopped or be any more difficult.</p>
<p class="p p2">So, we were very careful about our permitting processes. We don't get ahead of ourselves. We know it's going to take time. And we make sure we're working with the regulators very closely as doing it in a way that we don't get ahead of ourselves in the permitting process. And we don't get expectations because of our customers or investors ahead of that schedule as well. And I think that's the prudent way to take on pipeline permitting and project development in this environment.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Christine Cho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Now, if I -- maybe if I can move over to existing pipe. That was a very helpful update on things that you are looking at. When I think about natural gas demand, the Eastern Seaboard has been a huge region for growth. And there's still a fairly sizable mix of coal-powered plants in Virginia and North Carolina. And in Florida, there are plans to close down nuclear facilities and coal plants. However, it seems like these states are -- at least Virginia and North Carolina are skipping over natural gas completely and going straight to clean energy plants that mostly mandate renewables, although it looks like gas is going to be part of this solution in Florida. So, how should we think about the longer term growth potential for Transco and Gulfstream with this as the backdrop?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Alan Armstrong</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. I think it's really important that we actually look at the facts as opposed to kind of the messaging that goes on within the space these days because it's obviously very popular to talk about renewables addition, and it's not as popular to talk about natural gas. And so -- but if you really look at the details, in fact, EIA just put out a report on August 25th that shows the amount of gas generation capacity additions, actually shows all of the generation capacity additions that have been filed for and in long-range plan process. And if you look at that closely, you'll see that Virginia and North Carolina together over 50% of the capacity that's being added is from natural gas. And if you then take that -- and that's just on a raw capacity capability position, in other words, solar at full generation capacity. If you take it and look at it on a utilization basis, in other words, how much of the capacity is capable of being generated by those facilities and expected via a planned utilization, it's 77% of the planned additions in Virginia and North Carolina. So almost 80% of the new capacity is on natural gas.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">So again, I think it's really important to look at the facts and the actual plans on this stuff as oppose to kind of what's popular and what gets talked about. But, I think pouring through the details, you'll see that natural gas is really critical. Kind of taking that a step further, if you take a look at Duke's recent planning that they've put out public as an IRP, you'll see that in 2Q of ‘20, they laid out, I think they had six different plants on how they would get to meet their emission reduction targets that they’d laid out, by 2050; and five of those six plants had significant natural gas capacity additions included in the plant. In fact, the only plant that didn't include that was called Plant F. So, I think, we feel pretty good, and we certainly understand how important natural gas is at being a complement to renewables. We think there's going to be a lot of renewables continue to be invested and installed. But, we also know that practically that people cannot be planning on particularly these large utilities who are committed and have to maintain a sense of reliability for their customers and their industries that they support.</p>
<p class="p p3">They know that today that a practical application and the way to reduce emissions right here right now, not dreaming about what technology might be available in the future, but right here and right now, the way to make that happen is to combine renewables with natural gas power generation. And so, we think it's -- gas is probably losing the popularity contest, but very functionally continuing to gain ground and market share in these areas.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Christine Cho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So speaking about renewables, you guys recently announced your climate commitment, also put out a 56% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 and targeting net zero by 2050. You also launched the solar initiative and some other renewable things. These are some pretty ambitious plans, and I think the first, if I'm not mistaken, in U.S. Midstream, to come up with these sorts of defined plans to get to net zero. Can you talk about how you got here and what drove you to lead the way?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Alan Armstrong</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. Well, first of all, I think it's really important to know that when we took this on, as a management team to take a look at this, we looked at what everybody else is saying and we looked at what details they had behind getting there. And then, we kind of stared at ourselves and said, do we really just want to be somebody else saying the same old thing, which none of us are going to be accountable for by 2050, or do we really want to put something out there that we can actually affect and we as a management team can really make the difference on in again, kind of in the here and now. And we chose to really lay out a plan that we were confident that we could deliver on, that we knew how we were going to get there, and we weren't relying on somebody else having that responsibility. We were taking that on our own shoulders. And so, I would say, a lot of it is based on our existing capabilities, things that we are already investing in like methane reduction projects -- methane emission reduction projects, for instance, in our gathering systems up in the Northeast. Typically, when you would blow down a compressor facility and your gathering systems, you would just blow that down to atmosphere.</p>
<p class="p p3">And we've installed FLIR system on there, which are not cheap, by the way, but we've installed FLIR systems there to be able to -- to combust that rather than just letting it go. We also -- on our transmission systems, we've installed a lot of facilities to be able to -- rather than when we've got to do work or maintenance on pipeline rather than exhausting that to atmosphere, we're bringing in temporary compressors and pulling all of that -- all the natural gas off of the system. We're going to take down, put it into the downstream pipelines.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">And so, we've been at this a while. And we're also in all of our systems, we're using FLIR cameras to detect leaks on our -- within our plant -- processing plants and along our transmission systems. And so, we've been at this a while. I would just tell you, we have a very firm game plan that we've laid out and we actually have a what we call an elements of a net zero approach that we've put out that shows all the various elements of how we're going to get there in terms of reducing emission. So, ours is a very detailed plan. I think we have six different elements of ways that we're reducing our emissions across the system. And we have great confidence in our ability to get to that 2030.</p>
<p class="p p4">Question is well, how do you get to 20 -- how do you get to net zero 2050? And there's a lot of different ways. We have been working with the renewable gas foundation, we're going to become a member there. And so, there's a lot of credits available with taking renewable gas, putting it into our systems, and that gas would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere and it now becomes a useful source of fuel for the country. And so, there's a lot of ways that we've got to go after those kind of credits. And I would tell you that that piece of it getting to 2050 is a much more difficult task, but we're committed to doing what we can to try to get there. The good news is, a 56% reduction is really out right there in front of us and we know exactly how we're going to get there by 2030.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Christine Cho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">That sounds great. If we could maybe now move over to natural gas in the Northeast. Pricing has seen some strength lately, primarily around what the concern around what inventories can look like next year when withdrawal season is over. And the debate has been whether or not these producers in the Northeast go above maintenance mode and may they hedge more sort of position themselves to produce more than maybe what was anticipated six months ago, or just given their debt maturity profile they take the extra cash and use it as an opportunity to pay down debt. How would you say your conversations are leaning today with your customers?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Alan Armstrong</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. I mean, it's pretty hard to ignore the fact that we've seen the calendar '21 strip from March to now -- from March 1 to September 1, we've seen it go up by 30% for the whole calendar strip, which is a pretty amazing move. And if you look at the -- in the same time period, if you look at the 12-month forward, we've seen that move up by 44%. So, to think that that kind of move in the future's price wouldn't change people's minds about what they're looking at, it's just not realistic. That's a really nice move up in price. And as well, we've also seen the basis differential, what's available to and in terms of being able to lock in the basis differential between in Henry Hub and Leidy or Henry Hub and TETCO M2 is pretty attractive as well.</p>
<p class="p p4">And so, we think those are going to drive changes. The question of what are your producers thinking. I would tell you it's a pretty big mix. Some of them are charging hard. Right now, we're seeing some really great success and activity by Encino in the Utica. We are seeing great success by Southwestern in the Marcellus -- in the Southwestern Marcellus area. And we're seeing a lot of planning going on and a lot of requests for studies on our part about expansions available from some of our customers up in the Susquehanna and Bradford County systems.</p>
<p class="p p4">And I would say too early to call exactly what they'll do there. But like any prudent operator would be doing, I think they're planning and they're trying to understand what the cost would be -- to be able to take advantage of that forward pricing. So, some great margin opportunity for the producers up there. But I would tell you, it's kind of a mixed bag in terms of how quickly people are responding to it. We also have seen -- we saw a Chesapeake bring the rig back into the Haynesville, and they're having great success with their development there in the Haynesville as well. And we've got other -- three other producers that we're working with on some development plans in the Haynesville as well. So really, any of the dry gas areas are responding either through a pretty aggressive drilling already or on our systems or planning for next year and making sure that they can take that on. So I don't think there's a one size fits all, to answer your question. But a lot of change in behavior, whether it's through planning or actual drilling activity.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Christine Cho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">You mentioned Chesapeake. So, actually, if we can move over to just what goes on in bankruptcy. Years ago, there was a lot of chatter around how some gathering contracts, if structured correctly, or covenants that ran with the land, which made it difficult to reject in bankruptcy. Can you just give us your views here on how your contracts across your different assets would hold up in bankruptcy court? And then, also specifically, if you could address MVCs that are part of a gathering contract, do these hold up, or are they separate from the gathering contract?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Alan Armstrong</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. Maybe to take that latter part first, I just -- if you were to actually be looking at that document in front of you, one of our gathering contracts, it would be almost impossible for somebody to say, well, I want this piece of the agreement, but I don't want this piece of the agreement. So, while there might be some process within -- whilst somebody is in the post-petition period, there might be some arguments to say, well, it's unfair to make them pay the MVC, pay that deficit in the period. But, at the end of the day, we haven't seen and I don't think there's any evidence anywhere of a bankruptcy judge saying, well, you can take this part of the contract but you can cherry-pick elements of the contract. So, it just has not been done. And we don't see any evidence in any of the processes that we're working on right now, we don't see any evidence that either side thinks that that's an achievable outcome to be able to divorce themselves of the MVC. They've either -- they've got a choice of either rejecting the contract, maybe. And in most cases, they don't even have that because of the way the contracts and the way the contracts run with the land. But, even if they were to win that argument, which we think is a very low profitability, that's really -- would be their option at the end of the day, is one or the other. And frankly, getting your gas out of the area without that gathering service in any of these situations would be extremely difficult.</p>
<p class="p p5">So, to answer the last part of your question around MVCs, there's no evidence of that. There's no reason if you're -- any of you're involved in commercial contracting, there's just not really -- it's not like we do a gathering agreement, and then we have a side letter that says, oh, and you have to pay us the MVC. It's one integrated contract. And I think that's the way the courts will continue to look at those.</p>
<p class="p p5">On the question of, kind of the process, I would say, first of all, we've had the benefit of perfecting these agreements over time. And if you think about the Chesapeake agreements, all of those contracts with the exception of Bradford, all have been amended in very modern times. Haynesville was renegotiated, Eagle Ford was renegotiated. And so, we have the very-modern language that we think will stand up to any challenge in court. We love the venue that we're in with -- on the Chesapeake case. And I think they really respect that as well, because as you know, they haven't asked to reject any of the gathering contracts, despite rejecting a lot of the downstream service contracts.</p>
<p class="p p5">And so, we feel really good about that. Just to remind you, that is in the Southern District of Texas, and it is with judge Jones, who was a really outspoken critic in the case of Sabine, was an outspoken critic against the New York Bankruptcy Judge, that ruled in Sabine case and was also the same venue for Alta Mesa, which held that court. So, I think, we're in really good shape with our cases. And, we think, the most relevant case to look at is the Alta Mesa case, if you were to think about how the outcome would be here. We think, Sabine is not even all that relevant and not even a very similar situation, either in contract language, in the physical services that are being provided, and certainly not in terms of the judges that it's in front of.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">So, we're feeling really good about where both, the Eagle Ford, the Haynesville and the Bradford all stand in. And frankly, in the Bradford County, that is the lowest rate of any Marcellus gathering system that we have because it was a cost-of-service model that really worked well. Their volumes have been extremely high. And therefore, they've had the benefit of a very-efficient capital deployment that's allowed for even lower rates up there. So, we feel really good about where we stand there. We're excited, really honestly, to see Chesapeake get this burden off their shoulders in terms of debt and really get back to doing what they extremely well, which is growing and developing reserves that are dedicated to it.</p>
<p class="p p6">So, I would tell you, from my vantage point, as much as I know, that's a serious headache and not what the management team wanted there. We're excited to see this kind of passing of that issue and then getting on with growing their volumes and us helping serve them in a very healthy relationship.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Christine Cho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So, speaking about strengthening balance sheets, you yourself, Williams has made some progress on the deleveraging front, despite all that's going on in the world, less CapEx opportunities, has definitely helped while EBITDA has been resilient. I know, it's early to talk about next year, but NESE was likely a good size of CapEx originally slated for 2021. And now, the removal of it probably has lightened up the CapEx load for next year. Should we think that deleveraging will continue into next year? And, do you still feel your current leverage target is the right threshold?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Alan Armstrong</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Again, maybe I'll answer that first. In terms of being the right target, what we've laid out is a 4.2. And that's just on a GAAP basis. When the rating agencies make their adjustment to that, it winds up being about 4.5, which is where Moody's has told us we need to be to get to the Baa2 and the BBB flat at S&amp;P, which we already are, BBB flat at S&amp;P. And so, that -- we still think that's the right spot for us. And we are making good progress on reducing that. We do expect to have some free cash flow again next year. And so, we think we're on the right path to getting there. And I think as well, the fact that how well our cash flows have held up during this very volatile time period, both with crude oil prices and with the impact of COVID on the broader economy, and looking how well our businesses held up, we think that gives the rating agencies even more confidence that the number or that that position they have for us perhaps is even maybe a little strong. But, we're still focused on the 4.2s as we sit here today. And once we get past that number, then we'll look to see what the best use of our capital is beyond that, and it could be further debt reduction. But we really don't have to make that call just yet in terms of what the best use of our capital is, until we reach that point. And so, we are making good progress.</p>
<p class="p p6">In terms of our capital budget for next year, it's -- NESE was expected to be a big part of our investment, our capital budget for next year, but we do have -- remember, we do have three things that will be drivers for next year and perhaps a fourth. One is starting the development of a well project that we would be building for Shell and Chevron in Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And that's an expansion of our existing system that serves in the Perdido. Two is Regional Energy Access project, and that permitting is going pretty well. And we could be, not saying definitely will, but we could be in a position to starting to spend capital on that next year. And then, third is gathering expansions in the Northeast. As I mentioned earlier, there is planning efforts going on for expanding our systems, gathering systems in the Northeast that could put upward pressure on our capital budget for next year as well. So, those are still TBD, but we're hopeful. I would say Regional Energy Access is probably at the later end of next year just given how we would expect permitting to go. But, we're still very hopeful and getting started on that next year.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Christine Cho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So, maybe actually on that theme, to wrap up this chat. Midstream has long been thought of a business where you have to spend money to make money. You talked about -- you just listed three of the near-term projects that you're looking to do. But, how do we think about the growth of the business more longer term against the current backdrop where spending is not what it used to be? And could you slice up the investment opportunities you see for Williams across your different type of assets?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Alan Armstrong</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. Well, I think, we'll continue to see -- we have so many -- we have so much work ongoing right now looking at expansions along our transmission systems that I would expect to see that capital continue to be around 50% of our capital budget. I would expect to see our gathering business would be somewhere in the 25% of that and our deepwater systems maybe being 15% of that. And then, beyond that, for instance, we got early room for solar investments that we talked about as well. And so,, that's kind of how I would see things rounding out here in the near future.</p>
<p class="p p7">The good news is, particularly in the Northeast, as we've said many times before, a lot of our big capital spending has been done in that area. So, the big systems are in place. At this time point, it's a matter of very high-return capital investments that we get, because we're just adding a small amount of capital, but we're still getting the full rate of the whole service. So, said another way, when you first go into an area, your returns are very, very low on an ROE basis because you're having to build out big systems that are expandable for the long term, and it makes a lot more sense to build that with big pipe and not have to be coming back every other year and adding capacity but putting into bigger trunk lines and then just adding compression. And that's clearly how we've invested up there. And so, you're seeing our returns on capital up there move up really rapidly because how efficient our expansions are in terms of serving our customers. So, lighter capital, much better returns for quite some time in the Northeast. Fairly similar picture in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We've listed four projects in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico that we believe in -- around 2024 would be generating about $300 million of new EBITDA in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And only one of those, it looks like, is going to require any capital on our part. And so, this is a really attractive time period for Williams because we have been investing thinking about the business in the long term, not trying to just turn it quick but are really thinking about how we have a competitive advantage long-term and how we can drive high returns over the long term.</p>
<p class="p p7">And so, those big investments that we've made over the last 5 to 10 years in growing those positions up there are really, really have us well positioned now for some high incremental returns on our next phase of expansion in the systems.</p>
<p class="p p7">The pipelines really aren't like that. The pipelines, we don't get any windfalls returns. We generally get a 6 times multiple on our expansion. So, it's a very attractive projects. But, in the pipeline business, we do have to spend capital to grow our EBITDA. There isn't any, because of the regulated systems and we're at max rate, we're already charging max rate on our pipelines, there's not anything that discloses to us easy, versus the big gathering systems, you can get very high incremental return opportunities because you've already got the presence and the big assets in place.</p>
<p class="p p7">So that's how we're positioned for the next three or four years, and we feel really good about not necessarily capital investment, because frankly, I'd be a lot happier to see our EBITDA grow with no capital investment. And we're going to see more leaning into that over the next several years for Williams.</p>
