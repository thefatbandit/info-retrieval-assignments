<p class="p p1"><strong>Andrew Lazar</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome Mondelez back to our Global Staples Conference today. With us this afternoon for our virtual fireside chat are CEO, Dirk Van de Put; and CFO, Luca Zaramella. Thanks very much to you both for spending some time with us here today. Sorry we are not doing this in person of course but good to be with you nonetheless. And hopefully year from now we can all reconvene in person. </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Dirk Put</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Thank you for having us. We are happy to be here. </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Andrew Lazar</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Sure. Thanks Dirk. Perhaps maybe we start off, Dirk, a bit more broadly with sort of the state of play in the industry at this point. For me having covered the package food industry for some 25 years now. I am not that old; I started when I was incredibly young. I have been truly impressed by the agility of the industry to pivot when needed to serve consumers while also keeping everybody safe. And I know none of this has been easy or perfect but the industries responded really quite effectively. So I am trying to get a sense from you what stuck out in terms of the Mondelez response so far. </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Dirk Put</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Well, first of all, Andrew, it's good to hear that we both started very early in this industry. But that's why are still so young. Must have been 14 years or 15 years old or something like that. So I'd say from our perspective what I think we did well and as you said I think many companies did in our industry did it really well is -- we are able to put our priorities quite clearly quite early and of course there was safety first and we did a number of things around the world that you probably are perfectly aware of that most companies have done. And then refocus very heavily on supply chain continuity. We knew that that was going to be the key thing and for us with decentralized company as it relates to our supply chain that means an advantage because we are closer to our market. It means a disadvantage in the sense that we are dealing with many plants around the world and so to keep all going that was a particular challenge. And I think we've done that quite well. </p>
<p class="p p1">The other thing we did right at the beginning is we decided that center was growing to be one that gathers insight tracks and share the experiences, broadcast the best practices and to facilitate fast decision making in the local markets. So we did have people in India and in the US and in Brazil all trying to figure out what was going to happen to COVID; we did that all at the center and then informed them what we thought their course of action should be. And then with that I think the decisions we've taken a few years ago to create our business units and give them a lot of autonomy on how to react, particularly in those days to the consumers and do what's best for the consumer really helped us also because we were able to really react faster; they were able to react very fast, listen to their local consumers, see what was going on and go with the market price specific dynamics. I'd say they executed really well. Our teams' demonstrated great accountability, great entrepreneurial spirit, everything that we wanted. Our facilities I'd say stayed open for most part here and there, sometime they are closed for day or two but nothing major. Everybody prioritize on core SKUs so that we limited changeover and we were able to increase output. So I'd say between keeping the supply chain going, I mean good brand building and we did a lot in adapting the messaging on our brands to the local situation and the specific situation.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">All that led to a very good customer service and great market share gains. I think those were two things out of all these work that came out where we are different I'd say. I think our customers services stayed at a higher level and we gained market share. We are of course now trying to prepare very strongly and we did -- we are also right at the start to say, okay, we've to go through this crisis. We don't how long it's going to take but we are going to come out of this stronger and very creatively we called the program Emerging Strong, but it's a very comprehensive in-depth program that builds on our previous strategy but that really reinforce certain areas of that strategies in the middle of all this. So that we feel that we will hit the ground running when this all starts to ease and that we will be ahead of the pack. I'd say I am sure that we will talk a little bit about what all that means but those would be the points that I'd say customer service better, great market share gains and probably in a great position to emerge really strong from this. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Andrew Lazar</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Right. Thank you for that. Okay, may packaged food companies are beginning to talk about maybe taking some learnings from the pandemic and really making some longer-term structural changes not just on the service sales side but really on the cost structure side. Some have clearly stated that they are not going to back to a pre-pandemic cost structure. And recently Mondelez too mentioned taking sort of a fresh look at its cost structure and maybe you can remind us what some of the big buckets are that Mondelez is now targeting. Maybe a sense, if you can for the potential magnitude some of these cost savings are -- or how investors can dimensionalize the opportunity and most -- maybe most importantly is how this is different from maybe the big sort of cost savings initiatives years ago. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Luca Zaramella</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. Thank you, Andrew and good morning, everyone. As you said as it became apparent that COVID was a global pandemic with a lot of ramifications that would affect our business and customers and our company; we started developing the series of actions that we call emerged stronger. And therefore sure about simplifying our operation and tightening cost control something that I think we've done very well over time. But importantly, they are also about doubling down and playing to our advantage positions with our consumers. </p>
<p class="p p2">As we've just said this is not a new strategy at all. It is an acceleration of our existing strategy with the special attention to growth. On the efficiency side, back to your specific question; the big buckets are around simplification of the portfolio and there are multi-pronged which is through SKU reduction, better and more incremental innovation so reducing the net numbers of initiative and simplifying our portfolio of brands and sub brands. </p>
<p class="p p2">All of these should lead to a more effective and efficient supply chain and we are seeing the benefits already. And as well as the R&amp;D function that these less tied up in a lot of initiatives that are less incremental. And all these simplifications should lead also to lower inventory levels. There is an element of promo efficiency given the current consumer context in developed markets specifically, it doesn't make much sense to promote or to over promote. And I think you know that level of promotion might be something that we see also going forward. We've been adjusting our capital expenses and accelerating restructuring programs in our plants. Or for that matter which is most likely what everyone is doing these days reconsidering cost packages like travel and consultancy costs.</p>
<p class="p p2">We've been reducing our work in media and so we saw the opening of this crisis as an opportunity for us to be able to implement quickly all these changes. But we like to stress again the fact that the vast majority of these actions were in our strategic plan. They just have been accelerated. Importantly, the way you have to see this benefit is that they are invested back in the business to drive growth. For me, the outcome of emerged stronger is about potentially three outcomes. How much share do we retain going forward? How much of these cost savings are stable? And how much more investments are we making in the business, driving that virtual cycle that we've been talking to you about. So work in media investment, pursuing marketing excellence and expanding into global and local brands, it is something that we want to do. This is not about another and the large CBB program or supply chain on steroid as maybe we've done in the past.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">On the magnitude of these, this is acceleration and so I think the way you have to see it is in the context of our long-term algorithm. Again, the ultimate goal for us is to get back for instance in emerging markets as soon as possible. For the second part of the year; you will see COVID cost subsiding and the more stronger initiatives offsetting incremental investments and what we made of COVID extra cost. So you might see profit growth stabilizing in the second part of the year as opposed to what you saw in Q2 specifically where we were, have been hit by a bunch of COVID extra cost and some of these initiatives were not in full swing yet. </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Andrew Lazar</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Right. Thank you for that. Dirk, I'd like to pivot a bit to recent consumer behavior and consumption patterns. First of all, many have described this crisis as the greatest CPG trial experiment of our lifetime. And Mondelez too has discussed on the last call a jump in household penetration, which we all know is generally a key precursor to brand development. I guess what can you tell us thus far about how this is playing out for Mondelez in terms of repeat purchase? What this might mean for how sticky some of this recent trial by new or lapsed users could be? And what if actions if any of the companies may be doing differently than in the past to accomplish this sort of repeat buying given that household penetration has improved so dramatically.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Luca Zaramella</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">I didn't hear, you are on mute I believe. </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Dirk Put</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Sorry about that. I was saying that was an interesting question, Andrew, because you're right; this is probably the biggest trial ever in the consumer goods industry and the big question is what is going to happen after the special circumstances the consumer is living in today is going to fade and go back to normal. We're certainly very happy what we have seen so far. We're a global company; so the situation is different from market to market I would say, but in general I would say in our two biggest markets North America and Europe; we are seeing big increases in penetration and in repeat buying of our products. The most notable is U.S biscuits, so maybe I'll give you a few numbers related to that so that you get an idea. So we have an in 2.5 points, full points increase in penetration across our U.S biscuit business versus last year.</p>
<p class="p p3">We already were the leaders in penetration and this has extended our leading position; our penetration increase is double that of the nearest competitor. And so we're in the situation now that since the end of February 80% of U.S households have bought at least once; most of them more Mondelez biscuits. So the other thing to observe in the middle of all that is how many of those buyers if the penetration is going up are new. So we have a 6% increase in new buyers during the last 52 weeks in biscuits in the U.S. And on top we have a big increase in repeat rate of 90% the people that have bought since the end of February about 2x plus. So that's very strong and it does confirm that original buy that we had is certainly being extended in this there's high percentages of 3x , 4x and so on. What's also interesting is that more than 50% or in our - how would I explain this in our less known brands like Honey Maid Graham, Crackers, Newtons, Nila, Telegrams, those brands we see that the current buyers since the end of February 50% of them are new buyers, which is very significant. So it's an increase in new buyers in our big brands, but it's also the local brands that are getting a big benefit from it; so certainly the effects are there, we're happy with the repeat; seems to be pretty strong and so the question is what are we doing, the second part of your question what are you doing to hold on to that. </p>
<p class="p p3">The first thing is part of that emerging stronger program that Luca was talking about. It's about making sure that in the second half of the year we pulled back a little bit in the second quarter in our media investment. And we're resifting that into the second half. So the second half compared to last year or to any year is going to show a very big increase in our working media. Also within our A&amp;C budget we're shifting more of the investment into working media. So you see for instance a few examples U.S biscuits would see a 60% increase of their A&amp;C in the second half versus last year; some of those local jewels only made and that I was talking about we'll see 4x the level of investment they had last year. We're spending 3x more in e-commerce than last year.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">In Europe, our working media are going up by 30% versus last year; so big increase and we believe that will create a big buzz around our brand. We're also boosting significantly our in-store visibility because we live also around big events, back-to-school of the Premier league promotion in the UK; Christmas and so we are making sure that those are big start early in the store and well executed. And that will happen then as there is a recession taking hold we will need to keep an eye on value. So in the US that takes the form of multi-buys where we are trying to link brands with each other so for instance buy OREO and Bridges together or more multi-packs and family packs as part of our assortment in Europe that means we're shifting our portfolio more to the in-home consumption because that's going to help the value drive. </p>
<p class="p p4">And then also pushing more as well as our global brands our local brand in Europe because they usually come at the lower price point for instance in Russia, we have milk and OREO but we also have Altonorte and Jubilee which are the lower value brands. And then we have a number of strategic launches which are new; the launch of LU in Germany, we did the middle of this crisis. LU organic launch in France is new the extension of milk spread across Europe is new. So we're accompanying that but big new. So we believe that these examples I was giving you those are additional and new versus previous years much stronger program. So as the original first entry into a brand we're trying to reinforce that with a heavier activity calendar in the second half. And we feel pretty good that that will work for us.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Andrew Lazar</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Thank you for that. I guess how does Mondelez view the long-term sustainability of the accelerated market share gains? With big brands seemingly being the largest beneficiaries I mean how much of that I guess do you believe is driven by consumer behavior, i.e. loyalties to the brands they know and trust versus let's say better execution or supply chain from more scaled or branded players? In other words availability. So at some point we would think some others will eventually get their supply chains in better order. And I know on the last call you mentioned how this process is not necessarily simple and could take time, but we want to get your sense on that if we could.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Dirk Put</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. Well, if we look first what was happening before we entered this; we already had momentum and we are now showing in the last earnings call 85% of our revenue base; our market share is the same or up. And it's, as well as our global and local brands and it's not only in our key markets but also in our smaller markets, but that was already going on. I think without COVID the percentage of our market, of our revenue that would already show that would probably have been about the same. And so it's more the magnitude that we're seeing of the market share gain at the moment that is bigger than it was before. So I would say it would be logical to assume that the momentum we had before has continued throughout the crisis. So if I then go to what are -- what is causing the market share gains; there is a supply chain in the route market as you indicated that has led to higher TDPs, better customer service level; better on shelf availability. We have DSDs in a number of markets which has been an advantage of course. And then we also have a mixed benefit for us where the consumer is shifted into the products that are better for in-home consumption.</p>
<p class="p p4">So in chocolate more tablets than bars; in biscuits more basic biscuits or sophisticated biscuits, and those are all areas of strength for us. So and then the last one of course is that consumers are shifting more into trusted brands. That's a clear phenomenon that has happened through this. So I believe that the supply chain of course everybody will get their act together and we clearly see that. Being in the right part of the market or in the segments within our categories that will continue for a while; as long as we have COVID around us and I don't know what the latest estimate is, but I think we can say it's probably going to last until the mid of next year at least and consumers going to these brands that they know and trust and make them feel good that will continue to my opinion. And then you had the momentum from before, so it's very difficult to put a number on it. But I would expect to at least half or more of what we've gained to stick based on this analogy that I was trying to go through here. The supply chain as you mentioned is not so easy because it's not over yet and still around the world you get these flare-ups and issues and local governments only make decisions. So it's not like the supply chain focus and attention is over and so to make-- to get back to the steady state at a high level of customer service that might take a while. And it depends which situation you're in if that is going to be easy for you yes or no. So I can't speak for my colleagues but in our case it means we have to still remain very focused in every single plant around the world constantly to not drop the ball. So it's quite intense the work we have to do.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Andrew Lazar</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Thank you. Luca on the second quarter earnings call, Mondelez discussed reducing its SKU assortment by about 25% on a net basis; though with these SKUs representing less than 2% of sales. Is there a particular region and/ or category that this rationalization skews to? And our retailer is looking for a more simplified shelf set beyond the pandemic as well. And I guess just finally with that home consumption elevated at the moment is it -- I'm assuming it's much easier to simplify the portfolio now but I guess how do you ensure the right balance of simplification with the proper assortment for desired choice by consumers?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Luca Zaramella</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">The SKU reduction is part as I said previously of a broader program that encompasses SKU count innovation and the number of brands, sub brands we have. COVID as clearly required and forced us to a certain extent to be focused in our factories and in our sales forces to few SKUs that are the blockbusters of the business. And it became very apparent very soon that with plant outputs pretty much unchanged versus the previous periods despite the severe absenteeism that we saw due to COVID that has made apparent that the level of productivity that can be achieved by having better portfolio is material and it is meaningful. We are clearly making structural progress, but there is more to be done and we obviously want to ensure that we pace ourselves and that we keep the shelf space, so that revenue will go up rather than down. </p>
<p class="p p5">Benefits are not only about simplifying and less cost; they are also about working capital, customer service and that's never before I think it is fair to say that retailers are up for it. In the end, it is better profit also for them and it is better return on shelf space that goes up for them and us. And around the world it simplifies where we don't have DSDs and we don't have DSDs everywhere; it simplify the operation of those retailers too. The effort quite frankly is evenly spread throughout all the regions and the business units. There are regions that are a little bit higher a little bit lower depending on the level of complexity we had, but I think overall it is fairly homogeneous. As far as consumer choices are concerned; we really believe that with 98% plus of the portfolio having better service and better value is better for consumers too. And so I don't think there is a real drawback quite frankly. The same goes for innovation; I don't think we don't like innovation. We like innovation but we right -- we like the right innovation; we want innovation to be meaningful for consumers. So that's really what is behind this.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Andrew Lazar</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Great. I know that Mondelez saw emerging markets I think overall return to growth in June. And I think that was expected to continue into July. Maybe Dirk, can you catch us up a bit on how this is progressing and what you've seen across the emerging market landscape more recently?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Dirk Put</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. I need to keep my eye on that. So as we said in Q2 and as you just said, Andrew, that's what we see happening; we see the emerging markets Q3 looks a lot better than Q2. There is a difference you need to sort of segment the emerging markets. As we talked in the second quarter earnings that's still valid; two thirds of emerging markets we feel pretty good about the return to normality. We think that's going to go relatively well and fast. So I'm talking about India, Russia, China, Southeast Asia and India is probably the one in there that you want to sort of think a little bit through because yes it's going better and we returned back to growth in June not the same percentage growth as last year but pretty good. </p>
<p class="p p5">But there's still a significant amount of the traditional trade that is closed. And so it remains to be seen at which level the consumption will settle. And then part of that is also the European emerging markets; Eastern Europe and Russia and they didn't even go into negative territory in Q2. They were low single digits and they're growing from there. So I would say that group maybe with a little bit caution for India is doing very well. The other group which is Middle East, Africa and Latin America are the markets where we think that the effect will be bigger and COVID is still-- they're not over their peak yet; so it's still quite active. And on top they will be hit by a stronger recession which will affect the consumer more and it's going to, as a consequence to our opinion it's going to take them longer to recover. And so also which is particular to us is that we didn't have that much momentum going the crisis.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">I don't know about our colleagues but probably most companies were not having great momentum in Latin America before all of this started. So that also will mean that it's going to go a little bit slower. Now Latin America and it's only 13% of our net revenue; Africa, Middle East is more that is the unknown. It's not that it's particularly negative at the moment, but it's unclear what -- how to exactly forecast what's going to happen. So it's a smaller part of our portfolio and certainly of the emerging markets. And so we believe that overall emerging markets will come back quite well for us.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Andrew Lazar</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Thank you, very helpful. We've got just a couple minutes left. I was hoping we could maybe get towards one question Luca which is with the first half organic sales up about 3.7% at home consumption remaining elevated; emerging markets improving from the 2Q lows. It's not unreasonable to think that Mondelez can ultimately deliver on the initial goal of call it 3% plus organic sales growth for the full year albeit a different composition than initially anticipated. It's very early particularly given the volatility of the current environment, but as we think towards calendar 2021 to the extent developed market demand remains a bit elevated versus pre-COVID levels and the company starts to lap the more challenging emerging market trends from this year. And as you mentioned COVID costs start to roll off while cost savings start to flow through or the accelerated activities start to flow through even with reinvestment. And some of the significant reinvestment levels spend this year planned in the second half. I guess what I'm getting at is there any reason to think that 2021 should be far off from your long-term algorithm because obviously so many center store food companies have these extraordinarily difficult comps. And you will have some in certain markets too, but perhaps a little bit less so and some other idiosyncratic things that are more helpful. So I'm trying to get just some general thoughts around that, if we could.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Luca Zaramella</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, for sure. It is certainly our hope and honestly I think it is more than hope at this point as well. And that is why our colleagues and all of us are working so hard around the world, but even these days despite us and need specifically sticking to what we told you in terms of Q3 and all the regions returning to growth; we have few puts and takes and the situation is not fully stable, but you have a point when you say that we have deliver good growth so far and the emerging markets have been heavily impacted. I think that proves the resilience of our business and importantly majority of that growth if you take away all travel, retail and other major channels, it has been driven by share gains. We see improving conditions in most of the developing markets. I think you will be pleased with the numbers we are going to see in Q3 including our EMEA region and in Latin America, Brazil is coming back a bit. </p>
<p class="p p6">It is still to be proven that it can steadily grow from here. Certainly elevated consumption in developed markets and especially in North America is a tailwind these days, and it might subside a bit next year. But through our investment we will hopefully continue to build momentum and protecting our shared positions. So while premature to give you a sense about 2021, I think there is a scenario there in line with your predictions. I think in the end, look, the safe harbor for me is we in the right category and we truly believe we are. Do we have the right geographical portfolio? I think we are. The strategically developing markets are important and now we can accelerate expansion into those markets. And the goal for us is to outpace our category growth that is potentially improving next year and gaining share on top. So I don't want to avoid your question but I can't give you specific guidance. Hopefully, this provides a bit of color based on your question.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Andrew Lazar</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Absolutely, very helpful. Well, we've reached our time limit. I want to thank you both Dirk and Luca for taking the time with us today. And again hopefully next year we do this in person. As my grandmother used to say this too shall pass; it just may take a little time and be well. Looking forward to tracking the progress through the second half. Thanks again.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Dirk Put</strong></p>
