<p class="p p1"><strong>Lauren Lieberman</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. So next up in our line of presentations, we have Constellation Brands. While nurturing a beer portfolio that is well-aligned with modern-day consumer preferences, Constellation continues to look for ways to build on its competitive advantages through innovation and marketing and, of course, investments in cannabis and their portfolio optimization for wine and spirits. We're happy to have CFO, Garth Hankinson, with us today; and Investor Relations Officer, Patty Yahn-Urlaub, of course, without the video showing, joining me for Q&amp;A session. So I'm going to jump right in through lots of interesting stuff to cover. </p>
<p class="p p1">So Garth, key topic for the past few weeks for Constellation, of course, has been beer supply and demand. So back in July, you had mentioned that selling day-adjusted beer depletions for the second quarter were running in line with the first quarter. The scanner data since then has shown a slowdown as well as some building share losses. So we know you're dealing with expected out-of-stocks given the production curtailment in Mexico in April and May. But if you could just catch us up on shipment and depletion trends since July, what you're seeing in tracked versus untracked, whether production has fully ramped back up and if the expectation is still to be back at normal inventory levels in your fiscal third quarter.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>A - Garth Hankinson</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Thanks, Lauren. Thanks for hosting us today. The good news for us really is that due to our strong portfolio of brands, consumer demand remains quite robust, particularly for our core Modelo and Corona SKUs. In the scanner data that you mentioned, we have seen a bit of a deceleration in trends over the last month or so, and that's true of the entire beer category, not just Constellation Brands. We have experienced some out-of-stocks, as expected. I think as you noted and as everyone is aware, we did have a slowdown in production out of our Mexican breweries for nearly 2/3 of our Q1, and that eked a little bit into Q2. </p>
<p class="p p1">But since June, we have been back up and operating at normal production levels, and we are starting to really dig our way out of where we were relative to supply. Inventories, as a result of the slowdown, at both our retailers and our distribution centers was tight, but again, we're playing catch-up right now, and we're in a position where we're getting product out of Mexico as quickly as we can and getting it into the hands of our wholesalers, who are in turn getting it into the hands of our retailers. And so any out-of-stocks that we are experiencing, we're replenishing pretty quickly, and the out-of-stocks really only last for a matter of a couple of days. </p>
<p class="p p1">That cycle of us continuing to produce at normal levels, getting product out of Mexico as quickly as we can and into distributors and distributors to retailer, that cycle is going to go on for a few more days or a few more weeks, I should say. But really, the worst of this is behind us. And as you indicated or asked, we still are expecting that, come November time frame, we'll be back at more normal levels of inventory across our channel or across our system, meeting with our distributors and with our distribution centers here in the U.S. </p>
<p class="p p1">So as that relates to our second quarter performance in beer, we're going to see depletions up in the range of low to mid-single digits, and we're going to see our shipment trends down probably low-single digits. Obviously, we're just closing the quarter now, so we'll have more on that to come during our quarterly earnings call here in a few weeks. And then in Q3, what you certainly will see a reversal in that shipment-to-depletion gap, meaning in Q3, we'll ship more than we've depleted, and that's kind of consistent with how we messaged this back in our last earnings call where we said we needed to kind of look at Q2 and Q3 in aggregate.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Lauren Lieberman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay. Great. That's super helpful. If I stick with kind of the near term, the fall resets, I suppose, are coming up. But I think many retailers are just completing spring resets and who even knows that we could call it a fall reset given the out-of-stock dynamics across the industry. But if you think about further uptake of Shopper-First Shelf sets and what you kind of discussed with your retailers as an ideal shelf, what are you seeing? Kind of how are retailers viewing the portfolio? Any visibility into what's coming? And if at all, the out-of-stock challenges have kind of played into the equation of that shopper for shelf development.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Garth Hankinson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. So Shopper-First Shelf, the strategy behind that doesn't change and that strategy is that if you build the shelf with the consumer in mind, then the category, the entire category benefits. And so going through this COVID environment, we don't think that, that sort of strategy has ever been more relevant. Shoppers, clearly at this point, are looking to go into the retail outlets. They're wanting to be able to quickly find the brands that they love and the items that they need and then to be able to get out of the store. </p>
<p class="p p2">And so we're able to work with our retail partners to develop those shelf sets that have the best assortment of products that reflect consumer demand, and we've been pretty successful. We're on track to deliver our full year Shopper-First Shelf goals. And we've been able to influence over 18,000 resets so far, and we're going to continue to influence that over time. Fortunately, we have a great stable of brands that consumers really seek out. And so for us, it's easier to influence the retailer that they should be carrying our brands because the consumers are calling for them.</p>
<p class="p p2">As it relates to the out-of-stock and the impact that, that's having, we're not seeing any loss of shelf space at this point. Again, as I mentioned in your earlier question, our cycle right now is such that any out-of-stocks we have are short in duration, and so we're not seeing any shelf-space lossage now, and we're not expecting to experience it going forward.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Lauren Lieberman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay. That's great. Also, just on the topic of the fall, the sporting events come back online. There was a raging football draft in my house last night that I wasn't a part of, but that's what I think was happening. Just curious what your latest thinking is on marketing plans, the sequential step-up in spend, choices or changes in channel, be it digital, TV, et cetera, a lot of people will be watching from home.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Garth Hankinson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Sure. And look, it's a challenging environment to be supporting the brands and clearly, our team here has been incredibly nimble and agile and performed really well. But we're committed to continuing to spend aggressively behind our brands. Clearly, in the first half of the year, we didn't spend as much as what was in our plan, but that was really due to some of the venues, some of the platforms not being available to spend behind, thinking about live sports. As we move into the fall and as sports come back online, we are committed to continue to spend. We're seeing that consumers really have a hunger or a thirst, even, so to speak, to consume live sports. </p>
<p class="p p2">And in your house, where you're doing a draft, in my house, it's the NBA finals or the NBA playoffs that is given everybody's attention. And so far, the viewership and the ratings for sports has been very, very positive. Baseball, opening day for baseball, had record viewership or set a record for the last several years. The NBA regular season playoffs is performing very well. And clearly, people are looking forward to the start of the NFL. </p>
<p class="p p2">So we're going to spend big behind the Corona brand family. The Gameday Beach is back with Tony Romo, Corona is the official cerveza of the Los Angeles Rams, and we've extended our presence with the NBA and the NFL. And then likewise, with Modelo, we got major sports presence there as well with the NBA playoffs and finals. And we're doing some things digital and social as well doing some interesting things with websites, Bleacher Report and DraftKings and The Players' Tribune, so we're gearing up to continue to spend aggressively behind our brands as live sports come back online.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Lauren Lieberman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Great. And I've caught all the -- the Kim Crawford ads make me very thirsty watching the U.S. Open too. Okay. So just taking a step back maybe a little bit bigger picture about the beer category as a whole, it's been remarkably resilient throughout this crisis, but we've certainly been debating what might happen as government stimulus fades or it doesn't come back, and in particular, if that has a greater impact for imports and other high-end beer brands. So are you seeing any signs of either slower takeaway or trade-down in the category? Kind of how are you thinking about the potential for that from here?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Garth Hankinson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, clearly, this is something that we watch really closely. We're monitoring all of the economic indicators to see if we can get any early indications that there's any reason for concern or any reason that we need to adjust on the fly. The good news there is that, so far, we're not seeing anything to suggest any slowdown in consumer uptake nor are we seeing any impact to the premiumization trend. In fact, if you look at the consumer takeaway trends, you'll see that premiumization has continued, and the premium brands continue to outpace their more popular-priced counterparts. </p>
<p class="p p3">That is consistent with what we've seen in prior recessions. In 2008, we saw a bit of a slowdown in premiumization, but we didn't see any reversals there. And again, premium brands outpaced their competitors. So we don't have any reason to be concerned, as we sit here today, that our premium portfolio is at risk. But again, we do watch it very, very closely. One of the other things that we're watching very closely as it relates to the economy is the impact on the Hispanic consumer. Hispanic consumer has been disproportionately impacted by higher unemployment versus the general population. And typically it takes the Hispanic consumer, the Hispanic demographic a little bit longer to rebound as the upturn starts, so that's something that we're watching very closely. The good news there is that the unemployment rate for Hispanic consumers has improved significantly since April where it hit its highs and it's fallen almost in half since that point. So again, something that we watch closely so we can be ready to respond if needed.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Lauren Lieberman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. That's great. And then we can't talk about beer without talking about seltzer. So part of Corona seltzer's appeal, right, has been the potential for it to tap into that Hispanic community. According to Numerator data that we've looked at, Hispanics under-index other demographics in the seltzer category with just 3% household penetration. I think the national average is closer to 20%, 22%. Of course, you've got other brands trying to tap into this opportunity, right, you recently had the announcing from Coke on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer. How is Corona seltzer launch -- how is it faring versus your expectations? I think it was in July, you commented it was close to 90% incrementals to the Corona franchise. I guess is that still the case? And how is that going on the uptake amongst Hispanic versus general market consumers?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Garth Hankinson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. So we're really pleased with the performance of Corona Hard Seltzer. We've launched that at the beginning of our fiscal year, so just corresponded with the onset of the corona or the COVID pandemic, so to speak. And in that tough environment, it's performed very well. We've got distribution around 70%, which is in line with where we thought it would be at this time of the year. I think that, that's a testament to our sales team as well as the commitment that our retail and distributor partners have for the brand. Velocity is very strong. We're now the number four seltzer in the category. </p>
<p class="p p3">As it relates to incrementality, yes, we said 90% incremental previously. That has held true through sort of the latest information we have. We don't expect that it will stay at 90% forever, but the fact that it's at 90% now and it stayed at 90%, I mean, is very, very encouraging. And so we continue to be very, very bullish on the total seltzer category. Its growth has continued to defy gravity, so to speak, and we're really bullish on what we can do with Corona Hard Seltzer. As it relates to the Hispanic consumer, for us, we're, right now, sourcing about 15% to 25% of our volume from Hispanic consumers. And for other brands, that's closer to 10%. So we do seem to be able to tap into that consumer, resonate with that consumer a bit better than our competitive set, and we think that adoption rates will improve over time and continue to benefit us.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Lauren Lieberman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Great. And the last thing I just wanted to -- yes, the last one on beer, was just to touch on longer-term production. Headlines continue to come out of Mexico, new ones in August again, about negotiations around other regions to replace the inability to build in Mexicali. So could you provide us with an update on how those conversations are going? Maybe to the degree you can share, how much the CapEx already invested you might still be able to leverage or recover. And then also related is, if Corona seltzer kind of takes off, does your current production capacity allow you to meet that demand? And are you completely going to producing that in Mexico?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Garth Hankinson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. So as it relates to Mexicali and conversations with the Mexican government, so those conversations, that dialogue is ongoing, and it remains to be very, very productive. Unfortunately, I think that all of us would have hoped that the discussions would have happened more quickly, we have clear resolution on where we were going. But obviously the Mexican government, like all governments, is having to deal with COVID-19, right, so that slowed things down just a touch. </p>
<p class="p p4">That being said, again, the conversation, the dialogue is very, very positive, and there's still a full array of options for us as it relates to what we do next in Mexico, as it relates to additional capacity. That includes what can we salvage at Mexicali? What is it that we can do at our existing breweries, and longer term, if need be, what does that mean in terms of a third site other than Mexicali or additional site other than Mexicali? So that full array is still available. Again, we'll have more to say on that as our conversations with the Mexican government unfold. But again, things are trending in a good direction there. </p>
<p class="p p4">It's important to note that by the end of this year, we will have completed our expansion of Obregon. Obregon 9.0 will be complete by the end of this year, so that gives us ample capacity to meet any of our near-term demand needs. And so we do have some time to get this resolved. And once Obregon comes on, that gives us incremental capacity to meet our seltzer demand. So on that question, yes, so as we started this year, we were pretty clear that the most we were going to be able to sell of hard seltzer was kind of in that 8 million to 10 million range. </p>
<p class="p p4">We're absolutely going to be able or we'll absolutely sell everything that we make and be closer to the high end of that range. And next year, with the addition of Obregon and some other things, we'll at least have 2x that capacity for seltzer at a minimum. And then beyond, we're doing some other things beyond that to sort of take the limitation off of our seltzer capacity restrictions. So very, very, very positive that we've got the right capacity, the right amount of capacity to meet near-term demand for both our Mexican import portfolio as well as for Corona Hard Seltzer.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Lauren Lieberman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Great. I wanted to actually sneak in one more question about beer just related to production. And I mentioned it earlier that -- at least we use Nielsen and in the Nielsen data, there have been market share losses to the beer portfolio. And I just wanted to get your perspective on the degree to which you think that's related to the out-of-stock dynamics. Is there something else going on? But I think that's a topic that's come up a bunch in my conversations, and I wanted to just get your perspective on that.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Garth Hankinson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Sure. So I think that if you look at the Nielsen data, the IRI data, there's no denying that the trends for ourselves as well as the bar category have abated a bit. And certainly, for us, that's been impacted by our out-of-stock situation. But in terms of lost share, so I would say that we really haven't experienced a share loss, particularly if you take out the impact that seltzers had on the category and really the hyper-growth that seltzers had in the beer category. So excluding seltzer, we're actually gaining share in our top 5 markets of California, Texas, New York, Illinois and Florida. And it's when you layer on when you layer on seltzer that it looks as though we're having some share declines.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">And as I just articulated, we're really bullish around Corona Hard Seltzer, and we think that we can address the share loss related to seltzer through what we do with Corona Hard Seltzer as well as some of the other things we have going on. We've got some really neat innovation around Corona Hard Seltzer that we'll be able to launch next year as well as the venture investment we have with a company called Press. So we're able to target that seltzer market through those opportunities.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Lauren Lieberman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. That's great and then as promised, moving beyond beer. So wine and spirits demand has also been exceptionally strong through the crisis. Some of your power brands like Meiomi and Kim Crawford have been growing strong double digits in the tracked channels. So first just level-set on wine. Could you provide us with an update on where you stand in closing the Gallo deal?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Garth Hankinson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. So both Constellation and Gallo remain committed to completing this transaction, and we're very encouraged by the progress that we've been making. We continue to receive positive feedback from the FTC in addressing all of the concerns that they raised related to the transaction. And we expect consent decrees to be submitted to the commission for review and approval in the coming weeks. Obviously, this marks the final steps in what has been a much-longer-than-anticipated process.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Lauren Lieberman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. Okay. And then just Constellation has made 2 investments in the last 2 months, I think, in direct-to-consumer brands with Empathy Wines and Booker Vineyard. So online penetration in the alcohol category is still low, but we know it's picked up quite a bit through the crisis. So I was curious how you guys are thinking about the role of e-commerce as a channel, I guess, for particularly wine and spirits, and then with DTC brands, in particular, going forward.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Garth Hankinson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. So e-commerce has gained more penetration in terms of total retail sales in the last couple of months than they had in the last 10 years for beverage alcohol, so we're really seeing that consumers migrated to this channel through the pandemic, and 2/3 of consumers plan to continue their e-commerce habits in a post-COVID environment. And so we think that this is very much a bit of an inflection point, if you will, for this space in terms of consumer behavior. </p>
<p class="p p5">The e-commerce market, in total, inclusive of 3-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer for beer and wine and spirits is growing sort of triple digits so far this year, kind of between 350% and 400%, depending on the segment, and this is sort of twice what the pre-COVID 52-week trends were. As it relates to e-commerce, 3-tier e-commerce players are continuing to realize and recognize that e-commerce is more than just shipping, it's making sure that you've got multiple methods of fulfillment, whether that's click-or-collect and rush delivery, making sure that you're on all the right sort of delivery apps and making sure that you've got the right digital shelf placement. And so those are all things in terms of three tier e-commerce that we did well moving into, prior to COVID, and it's something that we have to continue to do well and outperform as we migrate to a post-COVID world. So in that regard, it was just doing more of what we're already doing. </p>
<p class="p p5">As it relates to DTC specifically, and these couple of acquisitions, DTC has really taken off as well. And I think that, as you probably know, the retail selling price for a brand that goes to DTC is higher than what you see in retail and the margins are higher than what you see when you go through wholesale. So clearly, there's an attractive nature to this business. And we didn't really feel that our internal skill set in DTC was mature enough to really take advantage of the opportunity and to exploit the opportunity that was in front of us, and so that's why we acquired the Empathy brand. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">Great brand that was just launched within the last, call it, 18 to 24 months; in a short period of time, able to sell a material number of cases; but more importantly, has a real platform and a real skill set through its marketing activities as well as its fulfillment and its technological capabilities that not only can we use to drive the Empathy brand, but we can take that and we can use that as a bit of a platform across a bit of our broader line portfolio. </p>
<p class="p p6">So we think that great opportunity lays in front of us today, and the best way to take advantage of that was to layer on a couple of these acquisitions, both of which -- Empathy, again, was relatively modest in terms of dollar amount and gave us some real capability that we didn't have before, and then Booker, which was a minority investment we made through our venture arm, is a great DTC brand, covers a hole in our portfolio and already has a lot of traction, as I say, in DTC, so something we look to leverage going forward.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Lauren Lieberman</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. That's great. And then I wanted to also ask about sort of the marketing returns on some of the bigger brands on Meiomi and Kim. I mean obviously, the growth rates have been tremendous, as I mentioned earlier. But I have been curious, I think maybe now we're 1.5 years into -- I think it's only 1 year of TV advertising for Kim Crawford, and it was sort of unprecedented to take a more premium-priced brand, TV advertise it in wine. And so I was curious, anything you've seen in terms of consumer research or insights as to how that's going. Is it a positive for the brand? Is it kind of neutral? And for the positioning of Kim Crawford that -- the price points you're able to realize.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Garth Hankinson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. So I think that the wine divestiture that we're in the midst of the strategy behind that is really predicated on having a smaller portfolio of brands that have a lot of equity, that are really strong brands that we think that we can advertise behind, right, and we can really kind of treat those brands more similarly to how we treat our large beer brands. And so that's the strategic rationale. </p>
<p class="p p6">And I think what you're seeing is that the early indications, the early returns are actually quite positive for not just Kim Crawford, but for Meiomi and for Kim Crawford and for SVEDKA. You're seeing the spend that we've put behind these brands has really resulted in a bit of an acceleration in their sales trends. So I don't have the specific numbers with me. We could follow-up with you on that, but they really have changed the growth profile as a result of the spend we put behind them.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Lauren Lieberman</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. That's great. I think I've got less than a minute. So at the risk of not running over, I'm going to wrap it there. But Garth, thanks so much for being here, and this is really great and probably really helpful to a lot of people. Patty, invisible, but thank you too, and I look forward to catching up again soon.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Garth Hankinson</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Lauren, thank you. Appreciate it.</p></div>
