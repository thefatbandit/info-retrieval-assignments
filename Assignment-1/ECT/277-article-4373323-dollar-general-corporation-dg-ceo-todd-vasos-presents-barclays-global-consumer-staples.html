<p class="p p1"><strong>Karen Short </strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning, everyone. My name is Karen Short, and I’m the Staples and Hardline Retail Analyst at Barclays. Today we are very pleased to once again welcome Dollar General to the Barclays Staples Conference. </p>
<p class="p p1">With us today we have Todd Vasos, CEO; John Garratt, EVP, CFO; and Jeff Owen, COO. I’m not sure if Dollar General could move the camera fast enough. We also have Donny Lau, VP, Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy on the call [inaudible]. </p>
<p class="p p1">Also if you’re listening to this, you are probably familiar with John and Todd, so I did wanted to just give a little introduction for Jeff. Jeff first joined DG as a store manager in 1992. He remained in the company for 20 years and returned to DG as an Executive Vice President of Store Operations. He was promoted to COO in August of 2019. </p>
<p class="p p1">So I believe this is where I hand it over to Don to read what is supposed to be a slightly shorter Safe Harbor Statement and [inaudible]. </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Donny Lau </strong></p>

<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Karen Short </strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you very much. So the format for this will be fireside only with just me asking the questions. Unfortunately no Q&amp;A given the format, so with that I’ll just move on then. </p>
<p class="p p1">You know obviously with 17,000 stores you’re a dominant force, not only in the discount space, but in all retail. And so I wanted to start a little bit the fact that I think some investors have been questioning whether or not there really is anymore share for you to gain from a demography perspective. You know not new store geography perspective, but a demographic perspective, because you did gain so much share in the ’08, ’09 recession. So I wanted to get a little bit, maybe your thoughts on – and I think it’s even more remarkable, because what you are seeing on comps is not a function of price sensitivity with the consumer particularly there. It does not – they don’t appear to be particularity price sensitive. So any color on that would be great. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Todd Vasos</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yeah Karen, this is Todd, thanks for the question. Yeah, I would tell you that we are really pleased with our positioning right now and where we sit, as we move through COVID. But even prior to COVID, when you start to think about who our core consumer is, and then also those consumers that we've seen trade down into the brand, even before COVID. Our fastest growing segment by our percentage basis was really a higher income consumer. </p>
<p class="p p2">So we were already getting if you will a trade down, but it was really not a trade down before COVID. I would characterize it more in that move – it was trial, right. We've done so much work to the box over the last couple of years with our cooler initiatives, you know with our NCI our programs, with our digital programs.</p>
<p class="p p2">Our digital programs are reaching a whole new customer base that we knew was out there, but we quite frankly weren't tapping into them through the old analog way that we went to market through advertising and brand awareness. Now with digital, we're able to tap into that and we’re seeing her come into the store and we're seeing multiple purchases. </p>
<p class="p p2">If you look at COVID, now what we’re seeing is acceleration of that little higher income, more digitally savvy consumer, and what we're seeing there is not only did she come in looking for goods because she really needed it, what we're finding is that she continues to do and repeat business with us over the up – over the last few months, and that really is a testament to that box and she's finding what she needs, she loves the prices. </p>
<p class="p p2">To your point we're delivering a pretty strong topline in a pretty flat inflation type of an environment that we're living in. But again, you know I think when you think of ’08,’09 and you start to think about the back end of COVID and where the economy is moving, right now with a lot of people out of work, we are positioned well. We are a retail that does very well in good times and we do well in bad times. In bad times our consumers just need us more, and an even broader selection and cross section of consumers need us more. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Karen Short</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">And you mentioned in one of the group meetings that, obviously we know you're gaining share because of Fresh and the NCI and I think your execution is pretty widely – understood that your execution is extremely strong. But you also mentioned drug, so I was wondering if you could just kind of add a little bit, because I think there does seem to be – some already have a pretty meaningful price gap advantage. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Todd Vasos</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">I’m sorry I missed the… </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">John Garratt </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Gap, price gap. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Todd Vasos</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Oh! Price gap, yeah. You cut in and out, I’m sorry Karen. So the price gaps, you know if you take a look at it, you know we are well positioned. We’re as well positioned as we've been as an organization in the 12 years nearly that I've been here and we continue to be a parity with mass 20% or so cheaper than grocery every day and 40% to 44% cheaper than drug every day. </p>
<p class="p p2">And I would tell you that, you know many of our outside share gains that we've seen really over the last few years and continues in 2020 is really coming from the drug side of the business. That's really where we're seeing you know a pretty strong trade into the brand, and it’s for a lot of reasons, but the main reason being the work that we've done with that box to make relevant and then you couple that with our pricing, you know she is really starting to resonate with that and making those trips to Dollar General for her every day over the counter needs, as well as her everyday basics and non-consumable needs for that matter. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Karen Short</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">And then maybe actually in terms of the trade down that you did comment on, on the conference call. I think was picked up a lot of media outlets and I wanted to see if you could just elaborate a little bit on that, and then along those lines you know you talk about the survey that you do fairly frequently with the customer base. What is – how is she responding today with the survey, with the second survey? </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Todd Vasos</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yeah, so you know if you take a look at where the customer is today, let's start there and then we'll talk about that trade down and what we’re seeing. If you take a look at it, you know if you dial the clock back to March and April, you know we as many consumer retailers saw a surge in business and obviously that business was directly attributable to COVID-19. And it really was the consumer trying to find and fill her pantry with everyday household needs, whether it be paper cleaning, food products, whatever it may be. </p>
<p class="p p3">What we're starting to see now, over the last call it two months or so, has been this. While she's no longer doing the full pantry fill in our home, what she is doing is not letting her stock actually go down inside of her store, and she's replenishing if you will her stocks. So if she consumes it during the week, she's rebuying it to keep stock levels high. So we're seeing that phenomenon actually happened right. </p>
<p class="p p3">You couple that for Dollar General with the trade down we’re seeing, and here's what we're seeing through our credit card data, as well as our consumer work that you mentioned Karen, is that we're seeing a little higher income consumer come into the brand. We are seeing through our credit card data and what she's telling us, is that she's made multiple trips over the last few months into the brand to buy her needs, she likes what she sees and she's continuing to want to shop us. </p>
<p class="p p3">That gives us great confidence as we think post COVID whenever that will be, that we got a consumer that is engaged in the brand and it will be up to us hear at Dollar General to make sure that we continue to engage her and keep Dollar General top of mind to the consumer. That's really the work that we did in ’08 and ’09; we got the playbook for that. </p>
<p class="p p3">What we've actually done is we've digitized if you will that playbook. It was pretty analog back in those days and we're ready to pull the trigger on that when we believe the time is right. We just don't believe the time is quite right yet. She's still completely in a COVID phase right now. But as we get to the back end of this and hopefully sooner than later, we'll be able to start to put those pieces out there to keep Dollar General top of mind. </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Karen Short</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay, that's helpful. And then when you think about, I mean obviously you're very much in control of your destiny and you know you laid out all the various initiatives that will continue to drive sales for quarters to come. When you think of the various initiatives, maybe could you just rank order what you think will be the biggest drivers. And then I also wanted to kind of pivot on to gross margin with the same question in terms of what drivers were and the sustainability? </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Todd Vasos</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Sure, I'll start with the drivers and then turn it over to you John for the margin drivers. Karen to your point, we've done so much work in that box pre-COVID and we have not slowed down even during these few months we've been dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic that’s been out there, so proud of the team.</p>
<p class="p p3">And quite frankly when you start to look at the rankings, our cooler initiative by far continues to be the biggest sales driving initiative that we have and I would tell you, because of DG Fresh and because of all the expansion that we've done with higher capacity coolers, as well as cooler doors, we’ve actually turned the clock back. </p>
<p class="p p3">If you think about it, we said we were in the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> inning of a baseball game if you will, before we started to do a lot of the work and especially before DG Fresh. We are actually – we've turned the clock back and we're actually now only in the 4<sup>th</sup> inning. We see a tremendous runway ahead of us there. That's why we are confident that it is and will continue to be our number one sales driving initiative as we go forward. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">NCI or the Non-Consumable Initiative would be second. I would tell you that that is a great initiative. It's been working fabulous so far and the great thing is we've been able to take the learning’s from those thousands of stores that we've already done and apply them back into the mother-ship if you will or our nearly 17,000 stores. So many items, in many of the planograms and I believe that is one of the reasons why we’ve had nine consecutive quarters of non-consumable same-store sale growth. So we’ve been on the positive side of that even before COVID and now with COVID we are showing the consumer a lot there. </p>
<p class="p p4">We’ve got a tremendous amount of other initiatives, but both this should be in our digital initiatives. It should also drive sales into the future, as well as some of the Better for You Initiatives and our Over the Counter, OTC initiatives continue to gain momentum and strength. John?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">John Garratt </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">And on the gross margin, I'm very pleased with the performance there. You know up 167 basis points this quarter, coupled with five consecutive quarters of growth in our gross margin and you really can see the initiatives contributing; DG Fresh, NCI as Todd mentioned. </p>
<p class="p p4">When you look at the key drivers for this quarter, number one is initial markups and when you look at what's driving the initial markups, it is DG Fresh. DG Fresh is having a significant impact on taking the cost out. We expected it to and that benefit will only grow as we scale it and get the efficiencies of serving more stores from the existing DC's as well as the sales benefited drives. </p>
<p class="p p4">Number two was mix. When we look at mix, NCI as Todd mentioned is having a big impact there. Not only in the NCI stores, but as Todd mentioned, as we spread the best of the best across the chain, it's really making that piece of the box very relevant. </p>
<p class="p p4">So while we certainly benefited from stimulus checks, as well as just a shift of wallet as people were stuck in their homes looking to fix up the house, do something to the yard, buy toys for the kids, what we've done to that box with the rotation of goods, their just dramatic value in the more aspirational products really made that relevant to get a big share of that business as it came in. Can't expect that kind of shift every quarter, but I think what we've done with that box really makes it relevant and sustainable to continue to drive strong growth in the non-consumables as Todd mentioned, evidenced by nine consecutive quarters there. </p>
<p class="p p4">The other thing within mix is, you also have mix within the mix. So within consumables, you have higher margin goods like health and beauty that have margins more like non-consumables, higher margins that have been doing particularly well there, you know as we noted given not only the convenient, but the significant price advantage we offer in those categories. </p>
<p class="p p4">And then number three is lower promotional markdowns. You know that's something we've been talking about for a number of quarters and we continue to be very targeted on our promotional activity, really leveraging the tools we've put in place. You know we know what really drives the incremental traffic, the incremental sales, what drives profitable sales growth and so it’s gotten very refined on the playbook for different situations and what promotional activity do in this environment, as we are priced right where we want to be in terms of the indexes, haven't needed to be as promotional. </p>
<p class="p p4">And so that's been the key three drivers and as you look ahead, as these initiatives scale. That’s the gift that keeps on giving and we obviously have a lot of other levers we've talked about between private label expansion, foreign sourcing expansion, shrink with the completion of the EAS units and the 40% increased tagging and then all the work the team's doing to drive supply chain efficiencies. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">Feel very good about the impact of initiatives and the levers positioning us to continue over the long term, continue to put it as a position to expand gross margin while driving the top line too.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Karen Short</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">That’s helpful. And then thinking about the holiday, I guess I'm curious on your views. On one hand I could argue that you know it could be very promotional, just you know no real Black Friday and Prime Day probably hitting 4Q. On the other hand I can argue that the consumer will do anything and everything she can to make her home festive. So how are you thinking about that just from a merchandising perspective and I guess also I would ask the same thing from an inventory perspective, because your inventories were remarkably good, I guess this last quarter, compared to some of the other retailers that we’ve, you know we’ve seen report. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Todd Vasos</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">I’ll take the top line and Jeff I’ll kick it over to you for the inventory discussion. If you take a look at it, you know we are fairly bullish on holiday and here's why. If you think about the Dollar General consumer and even this trade-out consumer that we talked about, you know for us it is more about Christmas in your home, it always has been, rights. </p>
<p class="p p5">So when you think of our seasonal offering, it's about decorating your home, some small gifts for the kids or relatives, you know we're not the big gift giving type of a retailer that's out there, and those retailors we don't know yet, but I think it will be a different holiday. But for those that are really geared toward like Dollar General, for making sure that your home is festive, and you have something for the kids to look forward to, even in the middle of a pandemic, I think we'll do pretty well. That's why we are pretty bullish on our offering and we for sure didn't cut any inventory and I’ll turn it over to Jeff, but we’ve actually went out and actually bought additional inventory, especially in the close-out realm. </p>
<p class="p p5">Jeff, you may want to just talk inventory. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Owen </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yeah, thanks Todd. You know first of all, our team was out in front of this early on in the pandemic. So I think it's a testament to the relationships we have with our suppliers and the fact that well before COVID, Dollar General we've been growing significantly with our suppliers, and as we talk to our suppliers daily, sometimes more than once a day, we were able to work with them and be creative about solving problems. </p>
<p class="p p5">To give you a great example, during the pandemic we were able to stand up a skew that we don't even carry in our assortment and in a matter of weeks we're able to bring that product in and get it on the shelf for the customer into all of our stores. So I think that's a testament to the merchandising team's creativity and the supply chain and the operator's ability to get it on the shelf.</p>
<p class="p p5">You know as we look to the back half of this year, I mean we certainly are making progress and we're pleased with the improvements we’re making along the inventory front. Certainly we're facing many other constraints that other retailers are, but I think it's a testament to the creative problem solving that our teams are able to come up with. </p>
<p class="p p5">And then in terms of the holiday merchandise like Todd mentioned, same thing. Our teams overseas were out in front of this as well, and it's pretty much Business As Usual and we're excited. In fact we're able to accelerate some of the holiday merchandise into the stores well ahead of normal, because of the progress we've seen in some of the sell-throughs this summer. So a testament to the team collaboration and we feel like we're in a good spot and we're continuing to make progress on the inventory side. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Karen Short</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Great! Now, speaking about brokers, I guess maybe I'm more excited about this than you are, I don't know, but it just seems like it's such a big opportunity for you. So I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you know the initial test stores showed on demographics, and I know you’ve indicated it's not you know a meaningful to-get driver, but obviously there is probably some went into the ticket, whether it's within that actual order or the customer buys it when they get to the store. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">So can you may be describe it, and then also describe how it actually works; like the actual model. I think it's more like a [inaudible] red type of model, the way I understand it. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Todd Vasos</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yeah, Karen you're right. It is like a premier red type of model, where if the consumer wants to be completely contactless, everything is done on her mobile device. She just walks up into the store, walks up to the four and eight foot area that we have designated for these holding packages, the holding area, look up their number, grab the package and walk out of the store, it's that simple, without any contact. But let me dial the clock back. </p>
<p class="p p6">I'm proud to say that as of today we've got right around 16,000 stores already up and running. So almost the entire chain, which is a great thing to see even in the midst of COVID and a lot of other adversities that are out there, and I wouldn't say we are not as excited as you are, we're excited about it, but you know us pretty well. We're cautiously optimistic when it comes to new initiatives. We tested it and we feel very, very confident that our consumers are going to gravitate to it and this new consumer that I referenced earlier, because she's definitely more digitally savvy, will resonate to this type of an offering.</p>
<p class="p p6">But in the – and I want to caution everybody, this is very early. But in the early goings, you know what we're seeing is a little higher basket, not much, but a little higher basket. Still a couple of extra item, still five to eight, nine items at the most, for the most part right now on average. So this is a different type of a Buy Online, Pick Up In The Store offering than you would see at a mass retailer or even our grocery friends that are out there. These are very manageable baskets and the shop, for our employee to shop that for the consumer is very, very quick. I mean you’re talking five, six items with an average pick of you know a minute or so. That would be our goal to do that, so it doesn't take a lot of time.</p>
<p class="p p6">But what we've seen early on is a couple of dollar extra basket, a couple of extra items than our normal transaction. I would tell you that we're seeing a good mix of both consumables and non-consumables, which is really nice to see.</p>
<p class="p p6">Now the interesting thing that we're seeing, that we thought we would get, but we're getting even a little bit more than we thought, is as she comes in, even though we've got that quick in and out that I described earlier, many, many of our customers are actually buying additional items when they come in. </p>
<p class="p p6">And what they're telling us through our consumer work, is you know you're gathering together some of that drudgery if you will type items, you know that’s not fun to shop, but I need and that frees up a couple of minutes for me quite frankly to browse maybe some of your non-consumable type items. So what we're seeing is a nice tack on sale to those that come and pick it up, and by the way, heavily weighted to non-consumables is what we’ve seen early on. </p>
<p class="p p6">So great to see that. We obviously like that, that's where the margins at. But again I want to caution everybody, we're still early days here, so you know we're going to continue to ensure that the consumer has a great experience and that's really what our goal initially is. </p>
<p class="p p6">We’re running a lot of water through the pipes if you will to make sure that the experience is there. So far it's a green light and our customers really like it, but we’ll do it the Dollar General way and that's methodically, but do it right. And to your point Karen, we execute here at Dollar General at a real high level on everything that we do. This will be no different. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Q - Karen Short</strong><br></p>
<p class="p p6">That’s helpful. And then on private label, you know the better for you is obviously a significant opportunity from an expansion perspective, beyond you know where you land at year end. I guess what is the gating factor? I'm not actually being able to roll that out even faster?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong>A - Jeff Owen<br></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Karen, this is Jeff. Well, I'll step back and say, you mention private brands, we’re very excited about our entire private brand portfolio, we made a lot of progress. You've heard us talk a lot about the different rebranding, repositioning. You got Clover Valley, that's over $1 billion brand for us and continues to grow. </p>
<p class="p p7">But on the Better for Use side, our good and smart brand is our private brand in that offering and so we're excited. We're in 6,000 stores right now and we expect to be in 7,000 by the end of the year, and quite frankly right now it's space, and as we think about space and continuing as Todd mentioned, methodically refining the assortment and continuing to talk to that customer to hear and see what she wants us to put in the assortment, continue to try things, continue to massage and manage that category, leveraging the strengths of our merchant teams, that's what's happening right now. And so as you look forward, all of our prototype building, so when we open and build the store from the ground up, we put the Better for You offering in.</p>
<p class="p p7">As you know we're opportunistic on some of our real estate as well and sometimes those formats might be smaller, because we're allowed to get into a certain area. So right now it's mostly on a space basis, but rest assured, we continue to refine that. </p>
<p class="p p7">And one other thing I'll mention is on DG Fresh. You know DG Fresh unlocks the ability to expand better for you in the coolers, and you've heard us talk about how impactful the coolers are. Now that we have the supply chain, and also now that we have the good and smart brand and other private brands, we expect to increase our penetration on private brand and the coolers as well. So I think you'll see a lot more, The Better for You offering in Dollar General stores as you go forward, both cold and in the cooler and in the dry set as well.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Todd Vasos</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">We're really excited about you know taking that private brand penetration that now sits in that low 20’s, to even greater heights with what you have talked about, so we're really excited about that. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Q - Karen Short</strong><br></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay. Now switching gears to the P&amp;L, I guess retail wages across some retailers have obviously been announced at permanently higher levels, and I know this is a constant question that you're always getting and you know I know the answer, because you’ve given it all the time, but it does still come up as a concern that you’ll have at some point to raise wages across the board, so wondering if you could just give an update on that.</p>
<p class="p p7">And then freight has been a big topic of discussion at this conference in particular, so at least for the back half and into 2021. So how are you thinking about that, about growth? </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>A - Todd Vasos</strong><br></p>
<p class="p p7">Jeff, you want to start?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>A - Jeff Owen<br></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yeah, first of all on the wage front Karen, I think you've heard us talk many times. In 2017 we invested in our store manager compensation and training to the tune of about $70 million and as we like to say, that gift that keeps on giving, that was well ahead and a tremendous investment, and we all know the importance of a store manager. It's critical to the success of this model. </p>
<p class="p p7">And so as you've heard us talk, our turnover continues to improve, and in fact this year at the store manager level we’re beating our record turnover of last year and really seeing turnover right now at the lowest levels that we've ever seen, so we're very pleased.</p>
<p class="p p7">We've always paid competitive wages and I think one of the things that we're pleased to see is the number of applicants. Our pipeline for people that want to work at Dollar General is full, and so we're very pleased with that, because the thing that you have to keep in mind about this model, is that the ability to grow at Dollar General at a very rapid amount of time is the number one currency and the number one attraction for folks to come into this model. And so you can imagine, someone can come into a store and be a store manager within about a three year period of time, and with the fact that we're growing so rapidly, it just gives people tremendous opportunity.</p>

<p class="p p8">And I'd also say that the other metric we look at to really determine if in fact we need to do something different is what we call our critical staffing metric, and that basically says is, how many people come to work every single day, so that we can provide a consistent shopping experience for the customer and we're seeing that at record levels too.</p>
<p class="p p8">So certainly we do not take a peanut butter approach to the entire chain. We attract and retain folks in our communities, the way we need to. So right now we don't see that we need to do anything different, but of course as things shift, then we'll do the same and we'll continue to attract and retain top quality talent. </p>

<p class="p p8">And as it relates to the transportation question that you asked, I think that was a second piece of that. You know we're seeing some pressure there as well, but I got to say, you know we – just like we talked about last year, you know we were out in front of the transportation piece with the many initiatives that we have around transportation. The biggest for us obviously is standing up our own private fleet and I'm happy to say that we've more than doubled the amount of tractors that we have in the fleet right now for 2020, and we've accelerated for the back half of the year with more tractors to get more of our private fleet moving. That is the number one way to reduce that cost, that cost pressure that we're seeing out there in many instances.</p>
<p class="p p8">So the team has done a great job so far. Again, I want to say that we are seeing some of those same pressures, but we're doing all we can to mitigate them and I think you know we're a couple of steps ahead, especially for many of our competitors that are out there in our space. </p>

<p class="p p8">Well, I need to be respectful of everyone on this call’s time, because I think we have reached the half hour mark. So team, thank you very much for being at the Staples conference and we hope that its live next year, but thanks. I really appreciate your support and I’ll join you in a couple of meetings later in this afternoon. </p>
