<p class="p p1"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Okay. Great. I hope everybody can hear me. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever you are. I guess everybody is turning in from everywhere, now that these things are virtual. I am Chris Danley, your friendly neighborhood, semiconductor analyst here at Citigroup. It's our pleasure to have our latest and greatest keynote from one of my topics in the space, in fact the stock I have had a buy on since 2012, I believe, which probably outlasts half the people's careers out there that are listening these days, Texas Instruments.</p>
<p class="p p1">So why do we like Texas Instruments so much? Simply put, it gets down to the best margin and earnings and free cash flow growth of any name that we cover and I want to mention a very important note.</p>
<p class="p p1">[AUDIO GAP]</p>
<p class="p p1">Hi guys. Can you hear me okay?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">I can hear you now, Chris.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Dave Pahl</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">You are back, yes.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. So it's just a lovely --</p>
<p class="p p1">[AUDIO GAP]</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">He just got cut out again.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Dave Pahl</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">I agree.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">-- In semiconductors. So it's a pleasure to have the CEO, Rich Templeton, here. Rich, how are you doing down there?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">I am doing terrific, Chris.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. Thanks. So I will get right into it. The topic on everybody's mind is COVID. By the way, for those of you out there that don't see me or Rich, this is an audio-only presentation. So it's kind of a shame that this the first time I have worn a suit in months and you don't get to see me. But anyway, Rich, why don't you talk about the impacts from COVID to Texas Instruments? Maybe go through the increased costs that you are incurring? And do you feel that this is having a long-term change in your business and your end markets? And we will jump right in.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. You know, Chris, I would describe it in general when I joined the earnings call back in, I guess, April and Dave and Rafael gave some updates in July during it, but I remain pleased with the way our team is handling things around the world. The good news is that the team was exceptionally well-prepared in terms of we operate in a very virtual way even before with a lot of WebEx meetings and we have got strong relationships built with the people. So the productivity of what we were able to get done on a global basis is very high. We continue to be doing, you know, kind of business as usual because we have processes in place with how we were selling virtually and I continue to have customer meetings. We just do them over WebEx or Zoom or whatever the tool of choice is, so navigating that all well. Our global footprint of diversified manufacturing locations and having great business continuity or BCP plans have really rewarded us as I think you saw even through the second quarter results as we were able to keep things running even with a lot of the different restrictions that took place around the world. So pleased with how the team is navigating it. We have really kept our eye on the ball. And all of us and I am sure you have got the same feeling, we look forward to getting back to seeing people and working more closely together, but we also think there is things you can learn in terms of can you travel more efficiently, meaning less in areas like that. But we look forward to getting back to more usual business environment probably sometime in 2021. So, so far so good.</p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. We can hear you.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Dave Pahl</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Standby, please. I think it dropped. Give me a second before --</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Okay. All right.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Dave Pahl</strong></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Chris just sent me a note that he is dialing in. His Zoom has crashed. He will be in there in a second.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">As soon as he can, excellent.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Dave Pahl</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay. I am dialing out to him. He accepted. So he should be joining shortly. Hello Chris, can you hear us?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Hi guys. Can you hear me?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">I hear you.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Dave Pahl</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">I can.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay. Great. Sorry, Zoom doesn't like me and we are on my cell phone. So I am probably going to get logged off on this once or twice as well. Anyway, Rich, just to pick up with the last question, apologies that I logged out. Do you think that COVID is having any impact on your end markets and in particular the automotive or the industrial end markets? Do you think that the automotive end market might be a little bit slower growing or faster growing? And the same thing with the industrial end market longer term as a result of COVID?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. You know, Chris, I think in general and I think you have monitored and watch this. I think as you went through the July earnings calls, I think things were reasonably logical, meaning things that had worked from home or remote learning drivers, be it in personal electronics were stronger, server/cloud stronger to handle capacity, automotive because you had North American and European plants taken down in late March and really just starting to come back up in June. And then within the industrial market, you could see the logical areas where obviously, a medical end market is going to do well where anything in the energy field or factory automation where you can't get people into plants to install stuff is going to be slower. So I think that all made reasonable sense.</p>
<p class="p p2">My might general guess over a four or five year period is that you are actually going to see secular trends accelerate. And so I think of things like electrification of vehicles, it's going to continue to move very strong and pull forward on that. I think you will find companies actually going on an increasing basis to more semiconductors and electronics because they have got to make their equipment better and more differentiated and more unique and those newer products get higher priority in terms of their products and their launches. So in general, I think it's going to look pretty much like we expected three, four years from now when you think about COVID and impacts from COVID.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Great. And since you are one of the deans of the space and TI is so diversified, I am going to ask you a few of the sort of the big pressing issues in semis. The question I get asked the most is, we are in the middle of a pandemic and a recession and yet semis are hitting new highs or at least they were as of three or four business days ago. So what's your impression as to why has semis done so well despite all these economic headwinds this year?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. And I think time will have to sort a little bit of this out and you watch this as much as anybody and have as good instincts. Some of it is, you have to remember that we were coming off of a pretty modest 2019 because 2017 and 2018 were pretty strong and then things pulled back a little bit in 2019. So the industry was due to do better in 2020, even though you have the pandemic hit early in the year. Second, as I think you are just seeing, as I commented before on implications of COVID, the things that our industry does and what we put electronics into to make people more productive has, if anything, accelerated through the pandemic. And that will vary depending on end market, as I commented. So if you are looking for some of those reasons, that's there.</p>
<p class="p p2">I know you have written, David sent me some your comments even before, do you have customers being careful about not wanting to be exposed to supply chain limitations due to ease of the pandemic or even on a broader basis some of the trade implications. It would be na√Øve to say there is not some of that but being able to quantify that is always difficult. The great news and it's how I look at things is, in the near term we know how we are going to play this, which is make sure that we are operating the factories pretty strong. It's really, really served us well and I think it will continue to serve us well. And then in the "longer term" and longer term, think two, three, four years out, you can really count on trend line growth and make sure you have got the right capacity invested to be able to support that as well. And so that's what we keep our eyes focused on. And we don't have to make the same decisions that you are trying to navigate or help investors through.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. And so if we look at your business as a whole, clearly some end markets are better and some end markets are still recovering. Does it feel like it's exhibiting something close to a normal seasonal pattern? And then what are the big challenges these days as visibility is still fairly limited? How about like the broader business for TI?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. I think as long as you are careful about getting down and looking at the smaller size end markets, I think that you can make "seasonal sense". But automotive is not seasonal, as you can well relate to in terms of you know what it did slowing down and coming back up. So I think you have just got to be very careful putting high-level seasonal trends on numbers and you have got a look at them at a more granular level. And then yes, I think they are making sense. I laugh at the visibility comment because everybody talks in good markets about high visibility and in bad markets they have none. But it's the same damn market. And so I think we have got a reasonable sense of what our customers are trying to do.</p>
<p class="p p3">It doesn't mean we will ever be able to predict it. It's why you heard us and saw us take the strategy that we described in April of keep our optionality very high. And we have got the luxury because of our product mix and our product diversity that we can do that and we can do that at actually a very, very low cost and therefore it puts us in a position to be most flexible. So we don't have to get it, call it, precisely right. And that's a very nice thing. And as you know, 10, 15 years ago, we didn't have that luxury as we were much more dependent on high-volume, single, concentrated customers where you better get those mixes called pretty accurately. We are fortunately, by design, in a very different situation.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. One other change in your business has been that you have been able to take your inventory a little bit higher and move of a consignment model. Can you just address the high levels of inventory that TI has? How comfortable you feel with that? And is this is a sign of things to come? Do you think you can run the business with 150, 160 days of inventory going forward?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. I think, in general, that and the best comparison and again you have followed us for a long time. Look at where we were 10, 15 years ago. When you are doing essentially custom high volume parts, you better not be operating at those rates or you are going to be in trouble. And today we have the luxury of being able to do that. And it really puts us in a position where our customers gain great confidence because we tell them, don't worry about given us a great forecast. Just when you need something, we will have. And that ends up being, I think, a much better way to do business with customers. And they respond well to that.</p>
<p class="p p3">Now in terms of what's the exact amount of inventory that we are going to need, Rafael and I have talked, I think you know we do all investors an update. We have got this "inventory range", we are above it right now. And I think what you see us doing is making good decisions thinking like owners, not just being static and trying to adhere to some arbitrary metric. But we will probably get an update or updated thoughts on that maybe at the capital management call in February 2021, we will give some insight into how we are thinking over time on that front.</p>
<p class="p p3">The good news is that because of the confidence in what we are building, you have just got extraordinarily low cost and the carrying cost on it is small. The other thing that gets lost in that a little bit and you suggested it even with the question is, we continue to bring much, much more of the inventory that used to be downstream in the channel onto our balance sheet. So the days on TI's balance sheet are a lot higher. But we look through the whole channel and try to make sense of that as well. So I think we have done a pretty thoughtful job and we will provide some better help about how to think about the appropriate inventory range, as I said, early next year.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Great. And then talking to another unique topic and then one of the reasons why we like TI is your high margins and your free cash flow growth. I know you guys don't necessarily give out formal margin targets anymore. But maybe just touch on what would be the future drivers of free cash flow growth from here, given your margins are so high?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. To me, it really comes down to the same things that we have talked about over time. And much of it in some ways centers around the four competitive advantages that you hear from Dave and you hear from Rafael of the foundation, manufacturing and technology. most visible or most recognized is our 300 millimeter wafer size analog manufacturing and then the breadth of our products and the reach of our channel and then the benefits of diversity and longevity. And you know, inside of that you see this growing mix of automotive and industrial and products that just a live a long time which, as you know, correlates quite well to increasing returns.</p>
<p class="p p4">So what are the things that continue to drive either gross margins or free cash flow margin? It's more 300 millimeter. It's better execution. It's more efficiency, higher quality of product mix, higher quality of end market, a number of the things that we have been doing over the past 10 years. Obviously, the amount of improvement that we can still get because we are just starting from a higher point is less but I still think there are some things that we can do.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. We like increasing returns here at Citi Research. Shifting gears, talk about another issue in semis is the whole trade war with China and companies going on or off the preferred list and starting with you Huawei. Can you just discuss the impact to your business from Huawei being put on the list? And then do you think that there any other companies that could get banned as well?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. The simplest way to describe it is and I think you probably every company is going to do this or at least I expect or hope and that is, we are going to comply with all the laws and all the rules that come out and we will deal with them as they occur. And we will not try to predict what that's going to look like. Dave may have the Huawei numbers but they have been declining and a reducing customer for us, in general. But we will deal with it and navigate it accordingly.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">And so, Rich, you were one of the first, I think, at our conference a couple years ago to talk about this is going to be an increasing reality as far as the sort of Cold War or trade war between the U.S. and China. Is TI doing anything to prepare for this continued issue to pop up between the two? Can you do anything to better prepare the company for it? Or is it just kind of take it as it goes?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Well, you know, if I recall and I think I recall the discussion and I had it both at the conference because I had spent time talking about it internally, was to get everybody expecting that this is a way of life going forward, not will the next trade negotiation resolve things because I never expected it would. I just think it's going to be a growing reality. And now the companies that adapt and adjust the deal with it best are going to be the ones that cope with it accordingly. And so I think we have had good efforts by our team to understand, the customer are still the customers.</p>
<p class="p p4">In China, even with tensions and even with any inclination of nationalism and preferences of where to buy, our job is still to come to them with the most appealing offers and most competitive offers and help them and help their business. And that's where we keep our teams focused right now. So I think that's the right way to approach it. And is it going to be an issue that, I think, continues to grow? It probably will. But we just have to be, it's not just happening at TI, it's happening across the industry. And we have got to just handle it better than anybody else.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. And then another, maybe it's a related topic on that. We are starting to hear more and more about them, starting to get more and more questions about is the possibility of the potential for the U.S. government to begin to subsidize the semiconductor industry, either parts of it or companies? Has this ever come up with you? Do you think that this is possible? Is this is a good thing? Is that a bad thing? Is it just fake news out there? What do you think of that topic?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. I am I am careful because I think there is a lot of different stories that you hear. And obviously, there is some proposed legislation and activities that are taking place. I go back to the things that we support, the things that what I spent time with the folks in DC is really to make the U.S. headquartered semiconductor companies and semiconductor industry strong for the next 10, 20 and 30 years. And I think the things that can be best done on that are making sure you are investing in the long term research and making sure that we have access to great people and then finally, make sure you have got competitive tax structure so you can run manufacturing in the U.S.</p>
<p class="p p5">And we have made progress on some of that over the past four years. We have gone backwards on some of it. And I think there is a growing awareness of Washington that having hit significant percent of the global semiconductor market is a good thing. And so I think people are trying to figure out just what that means and what are the right ways to be able to do that. We have seen, go back to the '80s, we have seen the semi-techs invested in to make sure that we were doing well against the growth of the Japanese competition. And so I think we will just have to find what the right balance of things are for this current phase.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. One question I got on that note from an investor, as it relates to 300 millimeter. So you are doing your 300 millimeter manufacturing at home in Dallas. Your competitors outsource that to TSMC. Could you just talk about the puts and takes of doing it internally? Why you chose to do it internally versus using a foundry like your competitors?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. I think it's just really simple math. And that is that when you have got your manufacturing internal and you run your manufacturing at world-class competitive levels, you end up with a cost advantage and you end up with better control of your supply chain. And so, to me, that is the only way when you operate a $10 billion semiconductor company. We are doing, pick a number, 40 billion units a year. When you look at how you manufacture and to me, COVID-19 was a perfect example of what TI can do because of the way we are structured with it internally.</p>
<p class="p p5">Not only do you get cost advantage, but we performed, I think, better than the majority of our competitors that were highly outsourced around the world or they had very concentrated test facilities. So I think we are just going to get growing and growing advantages of that internal manufacturing and technology. 300 millimeter is just kind of the most visible example of the advantage we have and we are going to keep building that advantage, leveraging it and I think it's going to serve us quite well.</p>
<p class="p p5">Put aside, do you have supply chain risks of stuff built in Taiwan over a five or 10 year period that's even beyond that question.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. And then another competitive question is, two of your biggest competitors are merging. Do you expect any change from that? And two of your biggest competitors just merged, I believe, two years ago. Have you seen any change, good or bad or otherwise from that merger?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. Chris, somewhat the question is, I think a good way to frame it, because it's actually how people thought about it internally even when that news came out just a couple of months back. You know, we compete against those companies while they were standalone. And when they are put together, you are competing with them together, they just have one name above them. And so nothing magical occurred, nothing different happened. And the biggest thing and you and I have talked about this in the past, when companies are busy integrating and merging, they are not working on getting fundamentally or organically stronger.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">And what I love about what we have been doing over the past five years and even beyond just the acquisition you are mentioning, the other acquisitions that took place particularly in 2016 and 2017, we have been busy building the company stronger organically. So more capabilities with TI.com, a better product execution, more disciplined internally of how we are executing. And just look at the steady and continuous gains, particularly on the analog side that you see us continue to achieve.</p>
<p class="p p6">And I do believe that in the end, that organic strength or that building the company stronger is what really determines success in the long term, not have you combined things together to make a larger company. So we feel pretty good about where we are and we feel pretty good about where we are going.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And speaking as the old COO, you have pretty intimate knowledge of your product lines, they are pretty diversified. Are there any products out there you see that you don't have that you would like to have?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">There is really two answers to that. At the high level, if you think about the kind of major product categories, go down a level or two inside of analog or a level or two inside of embedded and you put eight or 10 boxes across the page representing the next level of granularity, we have got checkmarks in all of them. And so we are in solid position and there is just nothing we have to go get. As we have already discussed on, "scale and size", we can afford to do things that our other competitors can't do. Running manufacturing of wafer fabs internally, the size of our sales force, what we do in the transition and bring customers direct, those are all great benefits of our "size and scale"</p>
<p class="p p6">But to the last part, if you go down far enough in the granularity of products, are there products that we don't have that if there was ever the right match, we could possibly do something, sure. We don't have something covering every space. We are not arrogant enough to think that. But the areas that we have got well covered, we are to keep building them and keep building them stronger.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And then on the M&amp;A front. So you guys were fairly active from roughly 2000 and 2010 in terms of M&amp;A and you really built up the analog business. So you have been inactive since 2010 and you have seen some other companies being a little more active. Has the reason you haven't done much since 2010? Is it just pure evaluation? Or you just felt like you had enough and you didn't anymore? Is it a combination of those? Maybe talk about why you haven't been as active in the last decade as you were in the previous decade.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. I am careful on that characterization because I actually think the more accurate one that somebody had pointed out, go back and look at the Burr-Browns and the Unitrodes, those were really 2000, pre-2000. So it really wasn't a decade of the 2000s. It was the end of the '90s where we thought there was really some good capabilities that we wanted to bring in to help accelerate the growth of our analog business.</p>
<p class="p p6">If you look at what we did and think of it as really 2009, 2010 and 1011 and you remember it well, I remember meeting with the morning that we announced the National deal in April 2011, everybody on this call remember how depressed everybody was about the economy in 2009, 2010 and 2011. They thought the sun was never going to come up again. And so we just used that as a great time to be more aggressive, be it picking up used wafer fab equipment, used wafer fabs or eventually National. So valuations really made great sense.</p>
<p class="p p6">And now, we have got and I think you have said it, we have got scale and we have got the capabilities and, oh by the way, valuations are exceptionally high. It's just not a great time to be doing those things. You heard me for a number of years, when you are buying things where the purchase price or the free cash flow yield on purchase price is 3%, I know as an operator how to get four or five percentage points on top of that, but you are just not doing your owners over the long term any good when you are buying stuff at that level. So I just think discipline on allocating of where you spend your money really matters in the long term and we are going to continue to stay disciplined on that front.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. And you have been pretty forthright about, we are just going to take our free cash flow after debt payback and go without buyback versus a dividend split. What are your thoughts on how much to the buyback versus how much to the dividend these days? Maybe talk about how you have implemented that so far this year and going forward?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. I think it continues and I think Rafael and Dave do a really nice job each February talking through during the capital management presentation just how we are thinking about that. We continue to get a lot of positive feedback from investors that that presentation is really helpful for them. It's a good reminder and any updates that we provide. But basically the two things you will see under stock repurchase and dividends is, on stock repurchases we just really think like owners and make sure that when you are buying back the stock, you are doing it in very creative ways for the owners for the long term.</p>
<p class="p p7">And go back and look at what we have even done over the past six or eight quarters. And now the grade on that, you don't get for 10 years, but just tactically look at what we have done and you see large purchases and I guess it was fourth quarter of 2018 and then you saw us again pretty aggressive in first quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2020. And I just think that thoughtfulness of really bringing, being very disciplined about what levels you buy back at really add to the owners for the long term.</p>
<p class="p p7">And on dividend, I think dividends play a key role. I think they allow us to attract a broader set of investors. And we think it's important to provide that dividend but also the ability for that dividend to grow. And I forget the exact data, but I think our past five years and probably 10 years growth rate on the average on the dividend is probably sitting in the 20% growth rate, maybe a little north of that.</p>
<p class="p p7">And in the end though, what this all comes back to is the comment you made which is, we have got to be great growers of free cash flow and discipline of being focused on free cash flow per share. Because then you have got the ability to then make decisions like stock repurchases or dividend increases.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. I think for the last 10 years it's averaged 22% and for the last five it's 17%, but who's counting. One other topic I wanted to talk to you that's TI specific is the move to a single distributor. I believe we are about two-thirds of the way through that. Can you just take us through sort of why you consolidated the distribution system first? And then I have a couple other questions on that.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. It gets a lot of attention in the near term and I think you are close enough. We should have the transition mostly completed by the end of this year. But as you know, we have been on this journey for five and really 10 years. And we believe the reach of our channel is a real asset. We think we do that work better. We think we get better results. I think you can see what we have been able to do with market share over time on that front.</p>
<p class="p p7">And I just think this is the kind of final piece to get that chapter completed to build closer, direct relationships. And the goal is not to be direct. The goal was to grow your revenue faster by being direct. And I think we are going to be able to do that, but obviously the proof on that will lie with how we perform in 2021 and 2022. But I think we are lining up to be able to do that well.</p>
<p class="p p7">And as we touched on before, I think that's a very difficult thing for our competitors to do because they haven't built out the sales and applications team. They haven't built the systems and the processes in place. So that heavy lifting and that thoughtful work over the long term is really going to be a great asset to us.</p>

<p class="p p8"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">A lot of people say that this will result in higher margins but perhaps lower revenue growth. Do you think that that's true, not true, some, all of it, none?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Not true. I think the top goal of this of building closer, direct relationships with customers is to grow faster. And so I think we are going to end up with greater market share and greater growth in terms of where revenue comes out. And we heard that same nonsense when we took distributors off of these design win registration programs. Well, it was probably five, six years ago now and you just watched us continue to power through that. And the gain in this final act will be, I think, the same thing.</p>
<p class="p p8">Are there potential margin lift? Obviously, when you have got fewer people stacking things up, there less margin lift. It's not the reason we are going after it. But obviously if we gain margin through the process of doing that, we will certainly accept it. But revenue growth is what we will really benefit from in the long term.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. We only have a couple of minutes left. I have got two more topics that I really want to touch on. Number one is the embedded business. You talked about your focus on free cash flow growth and the embedded business continues to have lower growth and lower margins than your other businesses like analog for example. Any thoughts or why wouldn't you get rid of it like you did with sensor and control? Or spin it out or do something like that? Why keep it?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. We will always and I think the question is a great way to frame it. If we thought that the better thing for long term free cash flow per share for the owners was to do something different, I think you have seen in our past, we wouldn't be afraid to do that. But the fact is, I think embedded is going to be a great contributor to our free cash flow per share growth over the next 10 years. We clearly have outperformed for four or five years stretch. We gave back some of that performance in 2018 and 2019. But we have got work and effort underway. So I have got a lot of confidence. I am going to guess, we are not getting that question three or four years from now and I think we are going to be very pleased with what it can do.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Great. And then last question, I would be remiss if I didn't ask you about the succession plan or replacement search. I think you had the shortest retirement this side of Michael Jordan in his prime. So what's the latest on succession plan? And how much longer you plan on hanging out?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. I refer to it as a brief sabbatical where Michael got to play baseball for a few years.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Chris Danley</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">You play golf. Okay.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Rich Templeton</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">It's really very simple and that is that we are going to make sure that we have got a great answer for a 10 or 15 year shift and I will be here until we got a good answer for that. I love the candidates and people that we have got leading the company inside. I think you have got a chance over the years to see the people that we have and just I believe they just keep getting better in terms of who we have growing up. You watched recently that we promoted Haviv Ilan to the Chief Operating Officer role. He is just going to simply help us build the company stronger. When you get a chance to meet him, I think you will see that intensity and that --</p>
