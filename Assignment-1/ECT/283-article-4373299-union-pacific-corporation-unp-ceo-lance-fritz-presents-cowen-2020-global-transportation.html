<p class="p p1"><strong>Jason Seidl</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Hey everyone, welcome back. This is Jason Seidl from Cowen. We're continuing day one of our conference here with Union Pacific. We are thrilled to have Lance Fritz, our CEO and Jennifer Hamann, CFO with us today. We're going to do some Q&amp;A, but after a brief update by Lance and Jennifer, so I'll turn it over to you guys.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Lance Fritz</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Hey, Jason, it's a pleasure to be here this morning. And thank you for hosting us. I've got some prepared comments, as you mentioned, today, they have accompanying slides, you'll be able to just go along with us. And we also have an updated pitch book that you should have access to.</p>
<p class="p p1">Before I start, I want to remind everybody that there - I'll be making some forward-looking commentaries. Those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. So please take a look at the Union website and our SEC filings for additional information about our risk factors.</p>
<p class="p p1">So going to slide three. Although I don't plan to recap our second quarter performance, it is important to reiterate our view that our results are another proof statement of the company's transformation through Unified Plan 2020. The team did a fantastic job of reducing our cost structure, while maintaining a high level of service in the face of volume decline of historic proportions.</p>
<p class="p p1">So turning to the third quarter, the chart on the right really does an excellent job of demonstrating how severely our volumes fell off in April and how quickly they've been coming back beginning in June. Third quarter to date our volumes were down 6% versus last year, driving our volume recovery has been premium of 4% versus the third quarter of 2019.</p>
<p class="p p1">Our intermodal business has been very strong this quarter, up close to 8%, while international is improving, and has been bolstered by a recent business win, it still remains down versus last year. Parcel and truckload, however, have seen double-digit growth in the quarter, driven by e-commerce and inventory restocking. Demand is at or near peak season levels.</p>
<p class="p p1">Automotive volumes are down 11% versus last year, that's still a significant recovery from where they were at the bottom in the second quarter. And while inventory levels remain low, we continue to watch demand as the US light vehicle sales forecast for 2020 is projected to be around 13.6 million units, which is down about 20% from last year.</p>
<p class="p p1">Our bulk business is down 11%, as coal continues to be down more than 20%. However, we've seen sequential improvement across the other business lines, beer [ph] driven by imports from Mexico and grain driven by exports are both up versus last year. So the ex-coal, our bulk businesses recovered nicely.</p>
<p class="p p1">Finally, our industrial business is down about 18% as it continues to be challenged by economic impacts from the pandemic and energy prices. Sand and crude [ph] remained significantly depressed, while other commodities like industrial chemicals reflect the current economic slowdown.</p>
<p class="p p1">A bright spot has been lumber, which is paced last year and reflects the strong housing market. In addition, our industrial business was slightly impacted by Hurricane Laura. However, our team did an excellent job of restoring service to that area and recovered.</p>
<p class="p p1">Going to slide four, as I mentioned earlier, our operating team has been presented with some substantial challenges this year. Sharp changes in volumes can be very challenging for rail network. However, the operating team continues to produce results in both service and efficiency, helping them deliver business wins in the marketplace.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Over the past month or so our intermodal service products has been challenged with a sharp increase in demand on the West Coast, as well as across the entire supply chain. Over the past several weeks, we've seen that service improve and is trending in the right direction. We remain committed to providing our intermodal customers with a high level service product.</p>
<p class="p p2">We continue to make improvement in trade line. As we are currently just under 9000 feet as we update transportation plans in order to handle the increased volumes. Our operating team continues to strike the appropriate balance of right sizing assets with customer commitments.</p>
<p class="p p2">Improvements you see across the rest of our key performance metrics demonstrates that we're not just combining trains and cutting assets at the expense of our service product. Our optimism for the future has never been higher. With a reliable service product and reduced cost structure we're seeing new markets open up for us. And given that we've – what we've accomplished during some pretty difficult times, it only gives us more confidence for what we can achieve in the future.</p>
<p class="p p2">Going to slide five. Since March, much of our focus has been on responding to the challenges presented to our company from the pandemic. That said, we understand our railroad is a reflection of society, and it's imperative that we continue to push and drive change that makes all of our lives better. At Union Pacific, we recognize the importance of delivering value for all of our stakeholders.</p>
<p class="p p2">As you are all probably aware of the United Nations has adopted 17 sustainability development goals, with a target date of completion by 2030. We believe Union Pacific plays a role in all of them. We've placed a focus on seven of those goals. Today I'll quickly highlight three actions we've taken in this arena.</p>
<p class="p p2">At Union Pacific we believe education is an essential foundation for improving the quality of life. Recently, we announced an innovative partnership with the University of Nebraska in Omaha. It removes the financial and scheduling barriers that have traditionally discouraged employees from seeking higher education. In a nutshell, what we've done is bought credit hours and made them available for free to all of our employees for continuing education.</p>
<p class="p p2">The response so far has been outstanding as more than 800 employees already expressed interest, with many already in the application and enrollment process. We're excited to see how it enhances our workforce as we move forward.</p>
<p class="p p2">We're also taking aggressive steps to remove barriers for women in the predominantly male dominated rail industry. Women make up approximately 5.5% of our total workforce, which represents one of our biggest diversity opportunities. That's why at the end of May, we announced the goal to double that number to 11% by the end of 2030.</p>
<p class="p p2">Last year, our customers cut 25 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by choosing rail over truck transportation. In March, we announced our intention to set science-based targets to help us further reduce our emissions. We recently submitted our proposed target for verification, and we anticipate publishing that target in the near future. This is an important step towards a more sustainable future.</p>
<p class="p p2">Wrapping up on slide six. Our guidance remains unchanged from what we discussed during the second quarter earnings call. Volumes are playing out relatively consistent with our expectations, and we still expect volumes for the full year to be down about 10%.</p>
<p class="p p2">We expect to see $500 million in productivity for the full year, and our long-standing guidance around pricing has remained unchanged. Together, these expectations for volume, price and productivity should produce year-over-year operating ratio improvement on a full year basis in 2020.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">Longer term our guidance to capital expenditure is less than 15% of revenue and dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45%, and ultimately, a 55% operating ratio remain intact. As you've heard me say many times, Union Pacific is well positioned for a future of long term growth and excellent returns.</p>
<p class="p p3">So with that, Jason, I'll turn it back to you for questions and answers.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Jason Seidl</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Thank you, Lance. And thank you for updating us on where UP is at and also some of your longer term goals, I am going to commend UP on that, especially on the - on gender equality. I always thought that women were sorely underrepresented in the supply chain and the women I've worked with over the years within transportation have always been extremely impressive, and I think we could just all benefit from their inclusion even more.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p3"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Q - Jason Seidl</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">I want to jump a little bit to PSR, which obviously is on everybody's mind, can you give us an update on how the implementation is going at UNP?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So a lot of the significant lift in terms of fundamentally changing the transportation plan and then finding specific large scale asset redeployment, or usage opportunities is in place. At this point, we're looking for ways to continue to tweak the plan and find additional opportunity to improve the service product and improve the efficiency and reliability of the service product.</p>
<p class="p p3">So things like - I think you're going to be seeing us take some actions in the intermodal space. We've got investment going on up in Chicago in G2. We've got investment going on down in Houston between Englewood and Settegast, and we're looking for additional investment to take place in LA, all with an eye towards kind of tweaking if you will our intermodal service product and product claims.</p>
<p class="p p3">We continue to look for ways to more efficiently manage our carload business in North Platte, Nebraska, where we have side-by-side yards and it's our largest switching operation, we think it's the largest yard in the world. We used to use those side-by-side yards as omnidirection, westbound use one yard or one hump and eastbound used another hump.</p>
<p class="p p3">We've consolidated those humping operations into one. So east and westbound use the same humping operation. That's only available to us by an excellent work that the team at North Platte is done to take their car dwell down to typically below 20 hours of a car. And that opens up capacity for us to use in ways that we hadn't been able to use it before.</p>
<p class="p p3">So that's happening all around the network, it continues to happen. One of the one of the biggest things we're doing is making sure that decision levels are driven all the way down into the frontline, that our frontline leadership and teams have the ability to control their destiny and look for ways to improve the service product and take out decision making layers. We've done that. And we're really pushing hard to help the local teams realize both the power and the accountability that they have to make that service product safer, more reliable, more efficient.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Jennifer Hamann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to what Lance is saying is, you know, train-length obviously has been a big part of our story as well. You've seen us continue to make excellent improvements there, did a great job in the second quarter when volumes were shrinking dramatically. And now you've seen us capture the benefits of that as sequentially, those volumes are improving, and that's another area of investment. We're putting side any extensions in a number of corridors that help to further facilitate that growth.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Excellent. I'm going to stick a little bit on the intermodal side here. You know, when you look intermodal volumes have been sort of in this recovery mode. What's brought about the recent recovery? Is it been just pure demand? Has it been Trump pricing on the rise, you know, over the past, call, whole month and half? What's driving that if you can look deeper into it?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yeah. Let's parse that out a little bit. I'll start by bifurcating intermodal and talk about international and domestic separately. International is just really all about the origin supply chain and China getting to be normal again through the second quarter and demand showing up to varying degrees in the US. So that's improved the pace of imports hitting the West Coast.</p>
<p class="p p4">Now only a portion of that turned into containers that are - international containers being railed inland for distribution. A lot of times those core containers turn into a transload opportunity for more domestic containers moving out of the LA basin or wherever the port district is.</p>
<p class="p p4">So, you know, we've seen a recovery in the international intermodal product, I think the inbound volumes are going to be higher in terms of boxes landed at the port, than the volumes that we're going to see as international containers going in because of that transload impact.</p>
<p class="p p4">In terms of domestic, there's a couple of different things happening. The first thing that's really juiced up demand is e-commerce and the parcel side of the world. So our parcel customers and in your mind you think, you know that UPS, FedEx, perhaps Amazon can be lumped in there to an extent. Their business is booming, and we're seeing demand through those service products really, really strong, which is good.</p>
<p class="p p4">We've also seen to your point, Jason, the truck market tighten up and that's reflective of restocking after retailers having destock even in the environment where there were large scale lockdowns or self quarantines, or shelter in place. There was still some amount of retail going on, but the supply chain was almost completely disrupted.</p>
<p class="p p4">And so I think a fair amount of destocking occurred and we're starting to see a fair amount of restocking. It's been occurring over the last couple of months, handful of months. And it's interesting to us. I had a conversation with one of our very large customers yesterday in the, call it, the agricultural space, you know, proteins, feeds [ph] and they're a big truck user, and they see truck tightness almost in like a wack-a-mole way. There will be a particular lane, a particular area that its very tight. It gets remedied, but that just creates a tightness somewhere else.</p>
<p class="p p4">And this customer also referenced what we've also heard and that is, in today's world, it's pretty hard to get drivers through school, graduated and into a cab of a truck. I don't know how long that lasts, but for whatever reason the unemployment benefits and the adder or whatever it is, all the things that have made truck workers supply tight periodically, that looks like that's current now, too. So that's what we experienced as what we're saying.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Jennifer Hamann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">And of course, we've also won some new business, which, you know, is a testament to the work that the team has been doing, both from Kenny’s side in terms of going out and beating bushes and talking to our customers about the value that we’ve added and then offering excellence side in terms of really driving reliable products. So across all three sectors that Lance mentioned, international, domestic and parcel, we've had business wins and so you're seeing that volumes going up too.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yeah, I want to add one little anecdotal reference to that is Kenny, our Chief Commercial Officer is reminded me that our lower cost base is turning into commercial wins in markets that we historically weren't winning in and specifically in short-haul business. We're across the carload and to a lesser degree in the intermodal product. We're winning business in 400 mile range, which is - has been historically a difficult range for us to penetrate.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Well, that's going to be interesting as we go into the next question. You know, we had a ports call not too long ago where the executive director for the port of LA was on and he was worried about losing up to 15% of his business because of obviously issues in the West Coast. Some changes in global supply chain trade patterns. How do you view your long term intermodal growth with that versus maybe is international going to shrink a little bit and then will you pick up on the domestic side because your service product is much better and you have a lower price? You have a lower price point because you reduced your cost basis?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yeah, there's a lot going on, on the international side. I think it starts from sourcing, where China still is, of course, a monster source of product imported into the United States. But you’ve definitely through the pandemic, and even before, we could see that shifting over into Vietnam, Malaysia, and some other sourcing areas. And that has been an impact on what's the most efficient routing to get it into market in the United States.</p>
<p class="p p5">So there's a little bit of that going on. There is a little bit of an issue with port of LA, port of Long Beach, having to deal with community relationships and elected officials who don't necessarily view inbound intermodal as a competitive advantage for their communities. And instead are focused on other things that periodically are increasing the cost of doing business through some of those ports.</p>
<p class="p p5">Now, I know both the executive director at Long Beach and LA, I know them both personally and they're very much focused on trying to do everything they can to make their ports competitive and the most attractive competitive option on the West Coast, and to be able to compete effectively against alternatives on the east.</p>
<p class="p p5">To that end, we've been working with both to create more visibility in the extended supply chain from Asia, all the way to destination in the United States, and chunk out the responsible areas for each participant of the supply chain, create a little bit more visibility in performance data, and then hold each other accountable and help each other achieve best in class performance along that supply chain.</p>
<p class="p p5">That's under way. The tool is in place. The KPIs are largely developed and being implemented. And now it's all about the hard work of making sure that we're performing well enough to make the LA Long Beach area look like the best place to bring import product in the United States.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Lance, you mentioned a little bit about the shifts in the sourcing and the global supply chain. You mentioned Southeast Asia. We've seen some go to Mexico as well. Now you guys interchange with every single interchange point in Mexico. Is that going to be a longer term benefit for you?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yeah, sure. We love it when Mexico sees foreign direct investment and an increase in production. We're very pleased with our franchise and its access into Mexico. We enjoy about 70% of the rail cross-border traffic to and from Mexico and it's balanced between the two large carriers in Mexico, the FXE and the KCSM.</p>
<p class="p p5">But I still look at Mexico and think we're under-penetrated. There is markets where we should have a greater share of the outbound and inbound, like along the key borders [ph] And so we're working very, very diligently to secure that business.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And why do you think it is that you're under-penetrated in Mexico? What's the impediment there?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, to a degree, it can be some of the complexities that occur at the border, in terms of getting product in and out. And the fact that in the trucking world, you can have a trailer sit and dwell for a little while. It's not optimal, but I think they treat that a little bit more - they're not quite as aggressive at making sure their assets are moving as we are globally, as an institution.</p>
<p class="p p5">I think also part of it is some of the same stuff we see in the United States that transportation management systems frequently are oriented towards truck as the natural mode and that means rail has to really work to make sure that we're as easy as we can be to do business with and take impediments from using us off the table. We're winning. We're seeing some penetration as it starts with a more sophisticated larger manufacturers, but there's a huge opportunity there.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. That's great. I want to switch over a little bit to western rail competition. Many times in the past that you guys have said that there was increased competition, and it was a little bit more difficult. Where does that stand right now between you and the BNSF?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">BNSF has always been aggressive, very capable competitor. You know, they compete very capably in coal, in the grain world, really across the spectrum of their book of business. What I'm very pleased about is both what Unified Plan 2020 is done to our cost structure to enable us to compete and earn good margin in those markets. And then second, the fact that our franchise is shaped differently than the BNSF. And it gives us a little more opportunity to diversify our product portfolio than I think they have.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So as you look at the BNSF, and I'm not asking you to talk for them here, but like as you lower your cost structure because of your PSR initiatives, you know, they're the sort of loan holdout on PSR. Do you think that they'll announce that they're doing PSR? Would that surprise you, I guess, it was better way to put it?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yeah, Jason, I'm not sure. And I'm not sure that it's fair to say they're not adopting elements or maybe PSR in its entirety. One thing that's different about the BNSF is that they don't - they don't have the same opportunity to tell their story publicly that a publicly traded company like Union Pacific, right. We get to do that on our quarterly earnings calls. We get to do that in forums like what you're holding here today. And they typically are kind of out of that world.</p>
<p class="p p6">So I think there's a little more opacity in terms of what they're doing. Now, I don't know any more than you do, right? I don't pretend to understand exactly what's going on in their world. But I do see them taking more aggressive action on their cost side. I mean, we could see that in what they did file in the second quarter. And, you know, I welcome if they were to go down the road of pursuing a PSR model, that means they would look at the world through the similar lens that we do. And I think that probably would be helpful.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Jennifer Hamann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And Jason, just add to that, I mean, you've been around the industry long enough, you know that, as an industry, there's so much interchange that goes on between all the railroads, even our competitors BNSF and so the stronger we can be as an industry, the better overall service product that we can give to our customers. And then we're competitive we can be against trucks, which is, you know, all of our primary competitors competing against one another, that big opportunity for us is trucks. And so the BNSF PSR and the rest of the industry to be talking that same language, I think it's a benefit long term for all of us.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">I think I think everybody within the rail industry wants an improved rail supply chain for sure. I want to switch a little bit speaking of supply chain and the rail side. Recently, the STB sent letters out to all the class ones, including Union Pacific expressing their concern about service qualities, as the volumes are coming back.</p>
<p class="p p6">Now, what is UNP and others doing to respond to these things and how often now are you talking to the STB in response to this?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Well, we have an excellent working relationship with the STB, Jason I think you know that. I personally speak to one of the board members, maybe the Chairman probably once every month, once every couple of months. We have connectivity into the STB routinely.</p>
<p class="p p6">What I understand this letter was meant to do was just in two things. One is thanking the railroads for the work that they've done through the pandemic, to support the US economy and do it in a safe fashion, while keeping our employees healthy. That was clearly about half the letter. And then the other half the letter was to say, hey, peaks coming up, and the economy is recovering. And we just want to remind you, you play a critical role, please make sure you've got mechanisms in place to fulfill that role.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">Union Pacific always has, for the longest time, since going back to the very early 2000s, we learned a lesson that we never wanted to be caught flat footed when it came to our crew base or our asset base in order to support the US economy. And that doesn't mean we sit around on the same amount of assets we used to, we don't need to, we're much more efficient. And our network responds more quickly to demand changes.</p>
<p class="p p7">But it does mean we still have at-the-ready locomotives in the neighborhood of several hundred. I think that number might be as high as 700 right now.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Jennifer Hamann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yeah, as we become more efficient, we put more in service to handle on an intermodal surge.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yeah…</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Jennifer Hamann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And so we're a little bit higher right now.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So we got at-the-ready locomotives, which are different from stored. At-the-ready, literally, can come back into service in this afternoon, whereas our store locomotives take a little bit of work. We continue to use our AWTS [ph] boards, which are alternative work and training service boards that puts an employee very close to us for callback, as opposed to a furlough status. It might take 20 or 30 days and on status, it takes maybe two days. So we use that as a tool.</p>
<p class="p p7">And then we're better at things like hiring and training and graduating a conductor. If you go back three or four years ago, that process took us maybe up to 24 weeks, today that process takes us 12 weeks. And the conductor that's graduated has done more on the job training and has a better sense for the work that actually gets done than our classroom trained conductors did, you know, half a decade ago.</p>
<p class="p p7">So there's just a number of things we've done to make sure that our service products are ready to go and, and we're in the middle of demonstrating that we had a big spike in domestic intermodal, particularly in parcel that got us congested, it ramps because boxes were dwelling. We work with our customers to get boxes off ran. And we also worked on our own service product and we're back approaching the kind of historical run rate that we expect to see.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Perfect. I'm going to ask one more quick question here and then hopefully get to one or two questions there. What are you doing more to interface with your customers that you haven't done before. We just spoke to one of your Eastern counterparts earlier and they were talking about putting out trip plan compliance, sort of between their own interchange points and then going forward they're going to bring in some of their partners to give a complete look for a trip plan compliance for their customers. They said up to the minute on the intermodal side and up the hour on the merchandise side. So I'd love to know what UP is doing?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">You know, we do the same thing with a broader assortment of KPIs with our customers. So when we visit with our customers, we take them through what we call PQR, a process quality review, and that includes the critical data for their service product. So if you're a coal customer, we're talking to you about your cycle times, your equipment utilization, how long it takes us to depart a train once you've released it to us, both load and empty.</p>
<p class="p p7">So there's certain things that a coal customer wants to see that are different from what an intermodal customer wants to see. They want to see in our lingo [indiscernible] are we on time or early, what's our percentage if we're late, what's the distribution of that lateness? And what are we doing about it? And if you're in the manifest world, we’re talking in the context of car trip plan compliance. And in that world, we also talk about asset utilization. How frequently we're departing on time, how frequently we're arriving on time, and what global service looks like, we call that to and from industry.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">So we do that routinely with all of our customers, with their salesperson, meeting with them. The big ones typically, it's quarterly, smaller ones that might be every half a year.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Jennifer Hamann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Sorry. The only thing I was going to say is you maybe heard us talk about the API's that we're doing with our customers. So if you think about working with our customers differently, part of that is just the data exchange and, you know, everyone's got their smartphone and want to be able to access you know, we have the Amazon effect, so to speak in terms of wanting to be able to track a package from your iPhone. And so we can put forth the number of API's that a customer can, using their own systems, be able to order a car, release a car, dispute service or dispute a waybill, you know, handle service issues, check on just the transit time.</p>
<p class="p p8">So those are things that are making us much more easy to do business with. And that's even more important when you think about, again, kind of going back to our discussion around the truck competition. A lot of our customers or people we'd like to have to be our customers are oriented towards the rail side of the world. They're used to their systems. They're used to facing the trucking companies. Like putting out these API's, we're making ourselves easier to do business with and that's more attractive to folks.</p>

<p class="p p8">And Jason, we are by far the industry leader there, we probably have three dozen. And we'll do as many as a customer wants, usually its more sophisticated customers that know how to have their transportation management system interface with ours in a way that's productive for them.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Great. I'm going to jump through a couple questions here that we've gotten from the audience. Do you think the public marketplace is too much importance on operating ratio? Do you expect to shift to focus more on top line growth and capturing market share?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">That's a great question. And here's how I would answer that. I would say there is a danger periodically of short handing, running the railroad and all you're trying to accomplish for your shareholders as operating ratio. Operating ratio is important, right? It's a great measure. We use it in part of our compensation. And it measures how efficiently are you using your operating expenses to run your railroad and deliver your service product.</p>
<p class="p p8">As we as a railroad approach, you know, a 55 operating ratio, and we're going to do that. There will probably come a time where it's less productive to spend a conversation talking about how low your operating ratio can go, when you're trying to peel off tens of points and, you know, 50 basis points, 500 basis points won't be probably an option.</p>
<p class="p p8">And at that point, and even now, it's probably more productive to talk about the business holistically, which is what we really care about is generating more cash, which comes from more operating income, which comes from increasing volume, price and productivity.</p>
<p class="p p8">Operating ratios in there, and it's important, it's one of our key measures. But I wouldn't say it's the only key measure we care about.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Jennifer Hamann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yeah. I mean, I think we still need to challenge ourselves and obviously our plan said we are. We don't think we have gotten to that point, we still have things to do. And that's why you hear still talk about the 55 target and the productivity things that we're doing. But we see tremendous opportunities to grow the business on this road, we have the capacity, that we're providing a great service product and that can help drive great cash returns for our shareholders as well.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay. One more here. And this is about incorporating more females into Union Pacific. What's the largest impediment to adding females to transportation and why do you think it will take as long as your goals have stated?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">I'll get to the weeds [ph] with you. So we've got a clear opportunity in the agreement population for females. There's an opportunity in our non-agreement. Think about our office environment as being - I'm going to give you a ballpark number, 30% female and we've got opportunity to continue to grow that, which we will. Our agreement population is maybe more like 3%. And by far the agreement population is the largest part of our workforce, that's 85% of our workforce or 90%.</p>
<p class="p p9">So what we've got to do is, we've got to take - we've got to do two things to do multiple things. At the top end of the funnel, we've got to make sure that we're attracting the incumbency or the available pool of females into the job application process. So that means we've got to write job descriptions that don't have women self selecting away from the job immediately, right. So the part, you know, there's the granularity of that I get the job description right.</p>
<p class="p p9">Am I making us maximally attractive to female population right at the front end, and then through the process we just got to - we've got to change our habits and behavior. So that our females that enter the funnel make it through in the same percentage as males that enter the funnel, right now that doesn't happen. We've got a physical performance test that knocks out a fair amount of women at that level of the process. And our interview process looks like it's knocking out more than I'd like it to.</p>
<p class="p p9">So there's a number of things in that process that we need to fix. And I think the big work is over on the agreement side, although we've got an opportunity on the non-agreement side.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Jennifer Hamann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">And just going to get more women in the funnel, too. I mean, when you look at the number of women that apply the jobs, it's way down. So where do we need to advertise maybe differently, what are different areas that we need to be reaching out to even make – get the job in front of a woman, that she would even see it, look at and consider it as something to apply to. So there's a – as Lance said, there's a mix of activity that we're identifying that can go around that. I am pretty excited about it, I think there's going to be a lot of opportunities for women, rather they're just coming out of school, rather there maybe a single mother, maybe there's somebody who's wanting to rejoin the workforce after having raised a family to get them back into the workforce of Union Pacific.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Lance Fritz</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Jason, these are great jobs, you know that, right? We pay awesome. We have awesome benefits. Over the last two or three years we've expanded our benefits for working mothers. So we're a great place to work. And we're not doing it for fun. We are firm believers that a more diverse workforce is a better workforce. Plus, we open up the universe to the full talent pool, not the talent pool that we have as with companies.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Jason Seidl</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">We're going to have to leave it there. I again, I applaud your work in this space, Lance and Jennifer and the rest of the UP family. Please give my best to the men and women of Union Pacific for helping, keeping our economy going during this pandemic. Their efforts are greatly appreciated by me and my team here at Cowen. And then we're going to be on next year for the clients for Schneider National. So everyone be safe out there.</p>
