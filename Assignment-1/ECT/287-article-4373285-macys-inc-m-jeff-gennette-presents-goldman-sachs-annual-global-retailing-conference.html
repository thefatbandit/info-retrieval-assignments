<p class="p p1"><strong>Alex Walvis</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning. This is Alex Walvis. I cover the apparel and accessories retailers here at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our 27th Annual GS Global Retail Conference. We're very excited about a packed agenda today. Kicking us off shortly is Macy's. But before I introduce them, I do need to read out a few disclosures.</p>

And here with us to discuss the business and the opportunities ahead are Jeff Gennette, Chairman and CEO; and Felicia Williams, Interim CFO. Welcome both and thank you so much for joining us.</p>
<p class="p p1">And Jeff is going to kick off with a few comments and then we'll dive into the Q&amp;A. So, Jeff, please do share your comments.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Jeff Gennette</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">So, thanks, Alex. And it's great to be with you this morning. So I'm going to give you a high level update on Macy's Inc. status and then Felicia and I will take your questions. So last week we've released our second quarter 2020 results. And on the call, I also provided an update on our Polaris strategy that we launched in February of this year. So I'm not going to go into that detail again, but I do want to touch on a few highlights that give us confidence that the Macy's Inc. business is stabilizing.</p>
<p class="p p1">We have secured $4.5 billion in refinancing to give us the liquidity that we need moving forward. We have completed a major organizational restructuring, resetting our cost base and resources to support our smaller size and greater emphasis on digital. We have utilized our position as a department store to quickly pivot on our merchandise category mix to reflect in demand product across all channels.</p>
<p class="p p1">We delivered stronger than anticipated second quarter performance across all three brands, Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, driven largely by the sales recovery of our stores. As a reminder, we closed our stores on March 18th, began reopening in May and had almost every store reopened by the end of June. The initial stores recovery went better than we initially modeled. And I'd like to share a little color on what we're seeing in our stores today.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">In total, our stores business is down about 40% to last year. However, within the recovery, there have been some bright spots. While our flagships remain challenged at down 50% with the drop in international tourism, our growth stores are tracking ahead of the total fleet, benefiting from our investments over the past two years. The 12 States where we've seen COVID resurgence hotspots have improved since July and these States include Florida, Texas, Arizona and California. Off-price is performing well on a comp store basis.</p>
<p class="p p2">Both Macy's and Bloomingdale's traffic has outperformed the total retail traffic tracking for 12 of the past 13 weeks. Customer experience scores, or what we call NPS, are at all time highs with significant year-over-year increases across the board. We've seen particular strength in the question of I feel safe while shopping, which registered the highest of all scored questions. Beauty, jewelry, home store, and center core accessories are our top performing businesses across almost all stores and this bodes well for holiday gift giving when these businesses accelerate in their penetration and importance.</p>
<p class="p p2">Now, while our stores were closed, our digital business accelerated rapidly. Customers that migrated online at unprecedented rates by some estimates, retail has seen 10 years of digital growth in just three months. A growing digital business is a good thing and growing digital profitability is within our line of sight. The increased focus on digital was top of mind when we rewired the cost structure of the organization this summer. In 2019, digital accounted for 25% of our business, today it's over 40%, and we expect digital to remain as a higher penetration of sales moving forward. Traffic on both macys.com and bloomingdales.com is up significantly and conversion is healthy.</p>
<p class="p p2">In mobile, both traffic and sales are growing and becoming a more significant portion of our digital business. In Q2, mobile and the app together accounted for 57% of sales and 77% of traffic. We used our sites to quickly expand our assortment to more in-demand products and have had good success using flash sales to clear spring inventory. We quickly launched curbside pickup, so customers could order online and do contactless pickup at their local store. We have a steady flow of new customers coming into our brands through the digital business, nearly 4 million new customers to the Macy's brand alone in the second quarter. These customers are younger and more diverse than our core.</p>
<p class="p p2">And when we ask this - and when we asked them why they came to Macy's, they called out value and the great brands we carry. We are laser focused on strategies to retain and engage these new customers. Today, digital already contributes to our profitability. And we have many layers to pull in the future to continue to improve this level of profitability. Across both digital and stores in both Bloomingdale's and Macy's, luxury is also outpacing our expectations. From textiles to shoes to handbags to mattresses to diamonds to luxury beauty and fragrances, luxury has proved to be strong across almost every category of business. For instance, at Bloomingdale's, luxury represented 30% of the Q2 2020 business compared to 20% in Q2 of 2019 and is trending 23 points better than the total company trend. Now we still have a way to go. We're encouraged by our progress to date. We will continue to expect a gradual recovery. However, we've modeled both upside and downside scenarios depending on the path of COVID-19 and the trends in consumer spending.</p>
<p class="p p2">The challenges that retail - that we face in retail are clear, but we also see opportunity. And I want to flag three areas in particular where we see significant growth potential, and we are going to - that we are going after as part of the Polaris strategy. First, digital. When COVID-19 hit, we accelerated everything on our digital agenda. We focused on investing in the fundamentals of our digital platforms to improve customer end-to-end experience, including a better browsing experience, smooth checkout and confirmed delivery dates.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">Second, our customer franchise. As I mentioned, we had 4 million new customers coming into Macy's in the second quarter alone. We're using loyalty and personalized communications guided by advanced data analytics to drive engagement and ensure these new customers come back to Macy's and migrate up our lifetime value curve. And third, the competitive landscape. Retail today has been radically disrupted. And while that disruption creates challenges, it also holds opportunity. With many competitors closing or struggling, we have an aggressive, intentional plan to bring new customers into the brands and gain market share.</p>
<p class="p p3">So to sum it up, we've navigated well through the rapid channel shift and the tumultuous environment. Flexibility continues to be the name of the game as we know that there will be new challenges along the way. But our team has learned how to execute through uncertainty by listening to our customers, following the data, reading the signs and pivoting quickly. I'm confident that Macy's Inc. will emerge on the other side of this crisis as a strong competitor ready to serve another generation of American consumers.</p>
<p class="p p3">So Alex, I throw to you for questions.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p3"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Q - Alex Walvis</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Jeff, thank you so much for sharing those introductory remarks and all the strategies underway at Macy's. You mentioned that retail has seen 10 years of digital growth in three months and Macy's has certainly been a part of that. You also mentioned that you're working to improve the profitability of the digital business. So my question is, longer term, do you think that digital penetration for the business will remain above 40%? And if so, how should we think about the associated impact on profitability for the business?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Gennette</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So Alex, let me start and then I'm going to kick it to Felicia for some more detail. So yes, I certainly believe that digital will remain in that 40%-or-higher range, and we were fortunate to head into the pandemic and the store closures with a strong digital business already. And I think it goes without saying that a strong digital business is a good thing, but the growing digital profitability is imperative, and that is within our line of sight.</p>
<p class="p p3">So the increased focus on digital it was top of mind really, as we rewired our cost base of making sure that we could maximize getting SG&amp;A as low as it could be to ensure that we could be profitable as an overall company as we imagine digital growing as a penetration. So as mentioned, digital already contributes to our profitability, but we still have a lot more lot more levers to pull. And Felicia, why don't you go through some of those.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Felicia Williams</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Sure. Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, Alex. Thanks for having me today. Let me just start by saying that we certainly have line of sight on our historical gross margin levels and we are committed to improving our margins, but we're thinking about our margins as an overall omnichannel retailer. And what I mean by that is we're looking at the digital business and the stores business together. And so we do have opportunities and strategies for margin improvement in our brick and mortar business, which is roughly 60% of the business.</p>
<p class="p p3">On the digital side, we are committed to a digital business that, as Jeff has said has become far more important to our customers, and we are very mindful with this lean into the digital business of the increased shipping costs that comes with that as well as transparent pricing that the consumer will have and continue to have. So just to be clear, we will continue to lean heavily into the digital business going forward. And this will as you said, Alex require us to offset the impact of that lean in on our gross margin.</p>
<p class="p p3">So a couple of things, for sure we have to drive higher contributions from the digital business. We have to really begin to implement those Polaris initiatives that will help mitigate before impact of the margin profitability.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">A couple of those, first would be a location level pricing. We've talked about that and the ability to get real clear visibility of our pricing and our value to our customer. Second, optimizing our POS strategy. Third, centralized fulfillment, which we previously talked about as holding flow will be a huge component to ensuring that we have the right inventory in the right channel and really in the right location to meet the customer demand.</p>
<p class="p p4">And then fourth is around strategic sourcing particularly in our private brands business. We are working on a new sourcing model for private brands to grow our gross margins which you guys know private brands is a huge chunk of our inventory.</p>
<p class="p p4">And lastly, we integrated our planning function under supply chain. This allowed us to create one business team to partner with the merchandising organization. And this has allowed us to better consolidate responsibilities. It reduces handoffs. We’ve expedited decision-making, this is really about getting the product much closer to the customer demands. And I think we're seeing the early benefits of this integration through our second quarter results of where we ended the second quarter with much leaner inventories, we were down 29% to last year and higher sell-throughs, and those higher sell-throughs were not only on our clearance business, but we also began to see higher sell-throughs on our regular price of merchandise as well. So we believe that long-term, these actions should support improve margins of the overall omni business.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Alex Walvis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">It's clear that a number of your initiatives, omnichannel rather than specific digital focus, then you did indeed mentioned in the prepared remarks that the growth stores were performing well. I wanted to move from a moment to discuss those growth stores. You have paused additional investments in growth stores instead, refocused capital spend on digital and omni initiatives. Can you discuss how your thinking has changed on necessary in-store reinvestments or in-store customer experience, and is that area of spend something they'll be looking to restart quickly into 2021?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Felicia Williams</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Sure, Jeff. I’ll take that one Alex. If - you're right, while we are pausing our investment and our additional growth doors. Our prior investments over the past two years are paying off and we are going to be continuing to draw on them. And just as a reminder, our investments that we made in stores over the past few years particularly in our growth stores represented about 50% of our brick and mortar business for both Macy's and Bloomingdale's.</p>
<p class="p p4">So while we have shifted investments from physical building. We are leaning really heavily into technology particularly the technology that is required to ensure our omnichannel capabilities and to continue to satisfy the customer demand, which is really a priority for our customers. Much of our investment in digital growth will also drive sales fulfillment through the store network.</p>
<p class="p p4">So for example, we are investing in extra service and we are targeting investments to speak where target investments for specific products and service opportunities, particularly those opportunities to ensure our customers experience a more frictionless experience, a more frictionless shopping environment, and we're investing to simplify returns, and that returns around transactional returns, the speed of returns and how we communicate with the customers regarding the returns. And we're working to create an expanded service menu.</p>
<p class="p p4">Alex, over time, we will have a lower CapEx in the medium term, but our capital spending will really be targeted to those areas of the business that aligned with our strategic priorities. So first we can't say it enough digital, digital is driving our revenue growth. And so we'll continue to lean and focus that as a priority with respect to our capital dollars and resources.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">And next will be a supply chain where we're driving margins and EBIT growth through lower delivery costs and improved efficiency. And third, technology really focused on improving the customer's overall omnichannel experiences and handheld and self-checkout, and also cause big ticket where we're really looking to streamline our delivery communications and look at the end-to-end delivery experience for our big ticket customers and really working to simplify that whole process.</p>
<p class="p p5">And then finally, and as important, our capital investments will be in new avenues of growth like Backstage and freestanding smaller format stores. We talked a little bit about this on the call, but if you remember specifically by the end of 2021, we will open several smaller format off mall Macy's, and we will test the smaller format of mall Bloomingdale's in every off mall store will have full service for pickup and return. And so we are keenly focused on these four priorities, digital supply chain technology and growth in the freestanding smallest formats and Backstage.So it is a mix.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Alex Walvis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">That's really clear, thanks for all the color. I had one more question on the store fleet. One of the questions, in fact at this conference, we often have a mist of questions that we also all companies and one of them this year is the question of whether you expect to have more or fewer stores in calendar 2021 versus 2019. I wonder if we could talk around that question a little bit, you at Macy's is targeted at 125 store closure program over three year time horizon, and on the second quarter, you indicated that the timeline for neighborhood store closures was fluid. Can you discuss what you mean by that fluidity and how we should be thinking about that program?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Felicia Williams</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure. 100%. You're right. The number of stores we intend to close that has not changed, we are modeling different scenarios with respect to the timing as you said. Just to take a step back, I just want to remind that, we are still generating cash and our lease locations even with the early reopening trends.</p>
<p class="p p5">And so in general, there is a lot of uncertainty over the next 6 to 12 months. And so we were prioritizing how we think about store closures and the timing. So one of our priorities would clearly be to preserve cash with maintaining our market coverage in the areas where we could potentially close a store. We want to be able to offer our customers less crowded options, where they feel more comfortable and we are using our current footprint really could support our digital business, particularly with BOPS, Buy Online, Pick Up In Store and buy online ship to store.</p>
<p class="p p5">But we are also modeling to take advantage of our competitor closings, which is this happening at an unusually accelerated pace. And as important, we really need the real estate environment to stabilize. And so those are some of the factors we're looking at. So let me just give you some specific examples with respect to the store fleet. So our neighborhood doors are currently outperforming our magnet stores during this pandemic, mainly - probably because they are often smaller or in centers with less traffic, which may be making our customer feel more comfortable or shopping during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="p p5">Our flagships in our large urban magnet doors are under more pressure due to the decline in domestic and international tourism and just put up fewer people coming into those downtown urban areas to work and to come to the offices.</p>
<p class="p p5">So some doors will benefit some competitor closings in the short-term, but in some cases the departure of multiple competitors in the mall could reduce traffic and could have a long-term impact on the overall status of the mall.</p>
<p class="p p5">So our intention is to change the composition of our store base, every closed mall based stores over time and open smaller format off-mall stores, as I said, in both an off-price format and a mini-Macy's or mini-Bloomingdale's concept.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">So at the - and so while you said we did have and I agree, we did have to pause our plans on our stores are closed, but we are ramping up back to the strategies we talked about in Polaris. We are maintaining our store presence, market coverage particularly in markets that are needed to support the digital business. We don't want to fire the customer. We don't want to create a dead zone. So at the end of the day, we are a true omnichannel retailer, and the key here is flexibility particularly as the pandemic runs its course.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Alex Walvis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">That's very clear. I want to take a moment here to talk about your outlook for the holiday season, Jeff you said in your introductory remarks, much color on how the business is performing today. On a call recently, you called out and anticipated shift earlier in holiday demand. I was wondering if you could comment on the omnichannel for some initiatives you're implementing its holiday, how you're thinking about balancing sales and margins in an environment where store traffic maybe limited particularly around those critical shopping days?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Gennette</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay, Alex, so just to give some broader context on holiday, and then I'll cover your points specifically. So one thing we know is that holiday is when our brands are the most penetrated when you look at our overall calendar and the percent we do of our - of full TSR base, it's highest in the months of November and December. And America comes to Macy's and Bloomingdale's for gifting. So in Q4, we always see an influx of new and occasional customers in addition to our regular customers.</p>
<p class="p p6">And so in this year, we also expect that traffic mix will include customers from brands that have closed, or as Felicia talked about just the entire competitive landscape and the tumult of that those customers are up for grabs. And we've been clear as well, some of our competitors about what the amount of that business looks like, and so we're looking at that at a door level and building our assortments on our digital platforms to ensure that we have the products that customer is looking for.</p>
<p class="p p6">So a first comment is really that we're ready for holiday of 2020. We have a - because America comes to us for gifts, we have a strong gifting plan with about 50% of our content that will be brand new. And we really made sure that we expanded the value bands of this. So we included now gifts under $15, but based on what we're also seeing in luxury at both Macy's, and Bloomingdale's, we're now including luxury categories and price points. That said, you know, I think the dynamics of the shopping season this year are certainly not predictable. We done lots of preparation. We've looked at lots of contingency planning for both upside as well as downside challenges.</p>
<p class="p p6">And today what we know is that the customer does expect to spend about the same amount as last year. So may be an elongated season, but that's news. So as it relates to your question about channel shift and fulfillment, so we're prepared to serve our customers any place where they want to go. So we've reset our inventory planning, so that we really have adequate supply for both dot-com and our stores, as Felicia talked about.</p>
<p class="p p6">And we will continue to support this shift with store fulfillment, as well as expanded options. Now, we set on the call that about 30% of our digital demand is fulfilled through stores. And that's not just through BOPS, it's now through curbside shipped to store. We just - we're proud to say we now have a same day delivery, a new partnership that has been made with DoorDash, which gives us national same day coverage.</p>
<p class="p p6">And we certainly have, we know that important last week before Christmas that we have to have all fulfillment options on the table, knowing that our carriers there may be supply issues or there may be cutoff issues that we want to make sure that the Macy's customer and Bloomingdale's customers have their gifts before Christmas or Hanukkah. We also have improved our customer communications on delivery options and expectations of delivery.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">As it relates to your question on balancing sales and margin, we feel good about the assortment and the availability of content for the holiday season. We have in demand products that we know we're going to get strong sell-through at regular price. And we expect that to continue into holiday.</p>
<p class="p p7">With respect to promotionality, we expect about the same as last year, and we will be more effective with our promotion with targeted offers and values to specific customers through personalization, which as I mentioned in my comments will be driven through our data analytics and geo-targeting. But again the cadence of the season, we do expect an elongated season, but that really all depends on the customer and we are going to adjust our promotional strategies based on how we learn about how they shop.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Alex Walvis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">You mentioned within that making sure that you're providing value gifting to customers during the holiday period. We've also talked already in this call about your Backstage strategy and indeed broader value strategy. I wonder if we could talk about the value strategy a little bit more broadly and perhaps juxtapose that against the sharp growth you're seeing in your luxury businesses?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Gennette</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. So what again, I think value is more than just price. So it's quality, it's service, it's trust. And so I think the Macy's thing sweet spot is that we offer fashion from off price to luxury and taking full advantage of the four banner brands that we have between Backstage Bloomingdale's, the outlet, the Macy's brand and the Bloomingdale's brand. And so certainly off prices is growing for us and robustly. And so we're going to continue to actually since the pandemic, we have launched new store within stores. As Felicia mentioned, we are going to be opening new Backstage freestanding stores, as well as Bloomingdale's the outlet stores. We're also going to be testing Backstage online, and we'll start to do a test of that in October of this year, I'm looking for what we can potentially iterate and then scale and future years.</p>
<p class="p p7">But we're certainly seeing very strong indications from customers about Backstage, we are very focused on profitability with the size of the business increase and the logistics costs are coming down. We're clearly getting to be experts in the four-wall payroll pieces of this. I think we've already got the content in the margin piece. We've got a good formula for that.</p>
<p class="p p7">So customers are loving that. And when you look at how Backstage and the Bloomingdale's, the outlet are performing quite strongly. So that's certainly on that end of the value equation. We have a robust plan. When you look at the luxury side that has been in both the Macy's as well as the Bloomingdale's in businesses has just been really strong. And so there is a lot of theories for that. I think one of them is that you've got customers that are not traveling. So those budgets that used to be spent on experiences are now going to kind of treating themselves with products.</p>
<p class="p p7">So when you look at it across any of these higher price points, so Macy's, you know, when you look at the furniture business above $3000, the mattress business above $1800, all luxury fragrances, all luxury skincare, fine jewelry just is on fire in both the Bloomingdale's in the Macy's brands. And that is - so customers are looking for places where they can get great value, that they're seeing it in our brands. So looking at the full gamut, when you think about our competitive mode is really being a fashion retailer really from those opening price points all the way to more luxury.</p>
<p class="p p7">So you got Backstage going out the door at about 12 bucks, you've got the Bloomingdale's outlet going out at about 33 bucks, Macy's brand at 35 bucks, and Bloomingdale's brand at 90 bucks. So you've got a lot of trends and a lot of brands that we can satisfy customer demand with that architecture. And so, and we're very committed to getting at that in the best way.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">So that's how we're looking at the holidays. So when you look at our gifting strategy as mentioned, that's the gamut that we're going to run. We learned a lot from Black Friday in July, which is our kind of our trial run of content and values. And so we learned from that, we're going to build that into our products as we go into this holiday season, luxury is obviously emerged quickly. So we're jumping on that. And when you look at the competitive landscape that would suggest that we have opportunities, across the gamut from off price to luxury based on the competitor tumult.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Alex Walvis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">I have two other questions that we're asking of all companies at this conference, and I'll perhaps combine them into one. That the first one is, by what year would you expect sales to return to 2019 levels? And the second one is, do you expect margins to be higher or lower in calendar ‘21 versus 2019. I know it might be a little bit early to give formal guidance, but how should we be thinking about how the business recovers back to pre-pandemic levels and the timelines around that as we think a little bit more into the medium term?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Felicia Williams</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. So, Alex, it's Felicia. I'll just say that you're right, it is a little bit early. But let me tell you how we're thinking about it. So we're modeling out several different scenarios and those scenarios consider macroeconomic conditions. And so how quickly will we come out of recession and get into a more robust recovery? As well as will we continue to experience resurgence and at what level? And so there is a scenario where we're coming out of recession fairly quickly.</p>
<p class="p p8">We have a vaccine. Our consumer - the consumer behavior and spending is increasing as worries about the resurgence and the pandemic begin to subside. And so that is definitely a more optimistic scenario, where you get to a faster recovery and a faster implication for sales and margin in the full P&amp;L driven by those macroeconomic factors. But as you know, we are taking a more gradual recovery, more conservative modeling assumptions, particularly around the pace of resurgence and the pace of recession.</p>
<p class="p p8">And so with that - and the implications on the competitive landscape is - as I said, is changing as we speak, and the impact of tourism on our business has been really difficult to predict. So for all those factors, it's a little bit too soon to say exactly when those recovery levels back to 2019 will begin to flow through. But that is how we're thinking about it. Specifically on the margin side, we are modeling and analyzing. And overall, I'll call it an omni P&amp;L, and we're modeling that omni P&amp;L holistically.</p>
<p class="p p8">And so we're focusing on every line: gross margin based on the strategies we discussed, operating margin based on our continued discipline and intense focus on expense management. And we are committed to returning to an EBITDA margin that really reflects the strength of our total omni business. And so it will take some time. And hopefully, we can discuss this more after the holidays.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Alex Walvis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">That’s very helpful context. Thanks, Felicia. I wonder, while we're looking into our crystal balls here, if we could talk a little bit about the category trends in the market. I know you've talked about seeing better performance in casual apparel. How - you did also comment that some of the dressier or formalwear categories will likely eventually recover and come back. Can you talk a little bit about how you see the apparel category mix of the business over the longer-term? And can you also discuss the new focus for categories across Macy's and Bloomingdale's and how that fits with your destination businesses longer term?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Gennette</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay, Alex. So, clearly, an advantage of being a department store is that we can flex between categories, brands, value bands, and we can scale quickly. So we've certainly seen a big change in how the customer is responding to online content as well as what - how they're responding now that they're back in stores as well. So the home businesses are obviously having a moment right now. So that - for our brands, both textiles, housewares, big ticket, have been exceptionally strong, and we are expecting that to go all the way through the back half of the year and into 2021.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9">The beauty business has been a standout as well, particularly in luxury, skincare and fragrances. We certainly have seen in the apparel businesses, to your question, this move towards active and athleisure, loungewear really, across both men's and women's. And also, denim has been quite strong across kids as well as men's and women's. So when you look at the destination businesses for us - we had six of them - four of them continue as just high-growth opportunities for us.</p>
<p class="p p9">And when you look at dresses and men's clothing, which are the two that we're stepping back from right now, I do believe they will be - I think dresses is a - when you think about the pieces of dresses, so you think about career, you think about casual and you think about social, social is really challenged right now. The dress - or the career pieces of the dress business are more challenged. And casual is actually quite strong. But in balance, I do believe that will come back as the COVID pandemic plays out.</p>
<p class="p p9">I think really the same thing in men's clothing. I would argue that before the pandemic, we were - when you look at 2019, we just had our best year in men's clothing. It really is - and we had our youngest customer in there. Great fashion. And for the way the guy is showing up at work or in a social life, I do believe that's going to come back. I think the competitive landscape is - remains - gives us more opportunity in this category. I don't think it's going to come back in 2020 but it will come back, and we'll be ready for it then.</p>
<p class="p p9">And I just think off-price, when you think about the focus four across both Bloomingdale's and Macy's, one of the four is really what we're doing in off-price, which I took you through. I think luxury in those price points is - that's part of the focus four for Bloomingdale's. Bloomingdale's also has textiles. So textiles is strong both at Macy's and Bloomingdale's. And that really is on the strength of our private brands at Macy's and our market brands at Bloomingdale's. And then the whole contemporary focus at Bloomingdale's continues.</p>
<p class="p p9">So look, I think we've got - we know the gamut that we play in. We have the opportunity to shift between categories. We can go after customer-wanted categories with Vendor Direct online. We've done lots of expansion of new categories based on the pandemic that we brought online first that we're now bringing into our stores. We've got lease options, both at Macy's and Bloomingdale's, to go after opportunities with less economic risk. So we're focused on all that.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Alex Walvis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">That’s really clear. Before we get to the end of our time here, and it's rapidly approaching, I do want to spend a moment on the cost efficiencies. SG&amp;A savings are a critical component of your Polaris strategy. You've outlined $1.5 billion of targeted savings across towards supply chain, marketing, corporate. You've also introduced a $600 million gross margin savings target associated with Polaris. Can you talk about the largest contributor of that - to that savings plan in the near term and whether that will be invested at all in the business? Any comment on how much of that savings will drop to the bottom line and how those will layer in through second half of 2020 and into 2021?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Felicia Williams</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Sure, Alex. Let me just start by saying we will continue our disciplined expense management to allow as much of that $2.1 billion as possible to flow to the bottom line. We're recognizing that some of these savings, as you said, will help mitigate higher costs from our aggressive lean into our digital business over the next few years. And so as we work to implement our Polaris strategy, we are closely managing our spend to really invest in those strategies that will drive both top line and bottom line growth.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10">And we're taking our historical rigor and analysis to that investment thesis and really thinking about every dollar. So just really quickly, as we're thinking about managing our cost base, we took a zero-based organization approach to restructuring our colleague team both in February and in July, and that's what really drove the rightsizing of the organizational structure given that we were - we are a smaller company. We are deconstructing our non payroll costs, which means that we're deep-diving on fixed and variable spend with really an eye towards driving efficiency around how we run our business.</p>
<p class="p p10">This realignment of our cost base, it was not easy by any stretch of the imagination. And I really want to just take two seconds to thank the entire team for all the work that have been accomplished. And so where we are today is that we have a culture that is really focused on maintaining a cost base that is fit for purpose. This means that we are opening up pockets of investments with things that the customer cares about while we will be allowing as much of that $2.1 billion to improve the bottom line by 2022 if possible.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Alex Walvis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">That’s great. And maybe I can just squeeze one final one in here and any closing remark is also welcome. We have one final company for all the companies at the conference this year, and there's some talk of potential increases in corporate taxes next year. If that were to happen, would you pull back on all investments or change your strategy in any other way? Any comments on that would be interesting.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Felicia Williams</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Sure. And I will try to be brief here because it is an interesting question. We have been modeling different federal effective tax rate scenarios, anywhere from the 21% where we are today to 28% to 35%. Two big pieces impact on the P&amp;L would be that immediate tax expense impact by just changing the basis points between 21% to plus whatever it goes up to.</p>
<p class="p p10">The other P&amp;L impact would be noncash, which would be the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities, which would impact our GAAP P&amp;L results. But then - and the third piece that we're modeling, which is really to the heart of your question, is around the implications on liquidity and financial flexibility. And all of our modeling of higher effective tax rate scenarios, all of our modeling concludes that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our needs and would have sufficient liquidity to manage through any changes in the effective tax rate.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Alex Walvis</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Fantastic. Thank you so much for sharing those thoughts. And with that we are at the end of our time here, so I will say thank you to Jeff, thank you to Felicia. We really appreciate you joining us today and kicking off our conference. And we are hoping everyone that's joined us on the line can join us for the next session starting here at 8:20 a.m. Thank you all and have a great day.</p>
