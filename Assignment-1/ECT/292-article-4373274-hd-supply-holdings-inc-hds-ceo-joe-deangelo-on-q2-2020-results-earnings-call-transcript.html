<p class="p p1"><strong>Joe DeAngelo</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Well thank you, Charlotte. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2020 earnings call. As always it is my privilege to share our company’s results with you on behalf of the over 11,000 HD Supply associates who work hard every day as one team driving customer success and value creation.</p>
<p class="p p1">Turning to Page 3. I’ll begin this morning by offering our sympathies and support to everyone affected by Hurricane Laura in Louisiana and Texas and those continue to be affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. </p>
<p class="p p1">HD Supply will continue to lead by living our unwavering commitment of protection and safety of our Associates and their families. And I want to thank the entire team especially our frontline drivers, and branch, and distribution center teams who have risen to the daily challenges, and safely operate in this time of adversity to continue to help our customers, and local communities thrive. I'm always amazed and proud of their dedication and sprit.</p>
<p class="p p1">Our second quarter performance has dramatically improved from the end of the first quarter. Our Facilities Maintenance team has done an incredible job by anticipating the needs of our customers, as they move to safely restart operations. </p>
<p class="p p1">Our merchandising sales and marketing teams have led the way in training and communication of how to reopen with confidence. We have provided the critical products we believe are needed to operate safe living and working environments including disinfectants, sanitizers, personal protective equipment, and touchless products.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Our teams continue to deliver on our customer promise despite the difficulty as far as the COVID 19 related products, durable goods shortages, and transformation, and shipping delays.</p>
<p class="p p2">Our performance improved throughout the second quarter building on the momentum that we reported back in June. Sales while down 4.4% year over year for the quarter improved sequentially each month of the quarter for both businesses.</p>
<p class="p p2">We’re encouraged by our second quarter and August performance and we are confident that we’re earning market share, performing better than our underlying markets across all of our sales verticals.</p>
<p class="p p2">We continue to generate strong free cash flow of $190 million during the quarter. We paid down our revolving credit facility in its entirety and we ended the quarter with a combined liquidity of nearly $1 billion, an increase $198 million from the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Brad and Evan will provide more color around our second quarter performance later in the call.</p>
<p class="p p2">I would now like to turn to the second half of the year. Within our Facilities Maintenance business, our multifamily, healthcare, and institutional verticals all delivered positive sales growth during the month of August, the first month of our fiscal third quarter, and our hospitality business was down approximately 14% compared with hospitality industry trends down close to 50%.</p>
<p class="p p2">We are confident we awarded earning shares across our sales verticals as our customers search for the most reliable vendor partner that can help them keep business running, and keep their associates and our customers safe. </p>
<p class="p p2">We have every expectation to maintain and expand our market share gains and realized thus far in 2020 and we expect that our end markets will continue to improve throughout the remainder of the year. However we recognize that there may be additional volatility as COVID 19 continues to be a threat. Due to the uncertainty we'll continue to withhold guidance for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2020. </p>
<p class="p p2">In June we spoke about being on track with the planned separation of our businesses into two separately traded public companies. In fact we’re targeting third quarter 2020 expand our Construction &amp; Industrial business when were approached by Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice regarding their interest in acquiring the business.</p>
<p class="p p2">After negotiation and discussion with our Board of Directors, we determined that the sales of the company will be in the best interest of our shareholders and associates. The sales process progressed rapidly, and on August 11th we announced the sale of our Construction &amp; Industrial business for a purchase price of $2.9 billion.</p>
<p class="p p2">We expect net proceeds from the transaction after taxes and transactions cost to approximate $2.5 billion. Proceeds will be used to repurchase share in HD Supply, paid down existing debt, procure our M&amp;A strategy within the Emerald living space market, and continue to invest organically in our business with near term capital expenditures estimated at 2% of annual revenues. We are incredibly excited about the sale.</p>
<p class="p p2">The speed with which we were able to act allows us to focus all of our attention on accelerating the growth of our Facilities Maintenance business and further differentiating the customer experience we provide. With the Construction &amp; Industrial sale expected to close in October I want to thank John Stegeman and his entire team for the leadership and service, HD Supply shareholders associates and customers.</p>
<p class="p p2">Over the past 10 years our Construction &amp; Industrial business sales have nearly tripled and adjusted EBITDA has grown nearly 30 fold. We believe this transaction will allow the Construction &amp; Industrial team to continue to profitably grow their business and we wish them best of luck.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">I will conclude by highlighting our teams continued commitment to our communities. During the third quarter we donated an additional $6 million of inventory to those in need including organizations providing shelter for victims of domestic violence and those in need of transitional or affordable housing. We’re proud of our HD Supply Associates dedication giving back during uncertain times.</p>
<p class="p p3">I will now turn the call over to Brad Paulsen who will provide an update on our Facilities Maintenance business.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Brad Paulsen</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Thank you, Joe and good morning. I’d like to start by thanking our team of nearly 6000 associates for their hard work and commitment to delivering incredible service to our customers across the United States and Canada. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our Associates and to date had no meaningful disruptions to any of our distribution centers, call centers, or leadership development center. This has allowed our teams to be there for our customers and provide the level of support they require to confidently reopen and safely operate their living space properties.</p>
<p class="p p3">Turning to Page 4. We saw a steady improvement in our performance throughout the second quarter despite continued pressure in our end markets. Our sales recovery showed a significant step forward in August, the 1st month of our fiscal third quarter by delivering year over year preliminary sales growth.</p>
<p class="p p3">The focus for our customers during the second quarter was the safe reopenening and operations on their living space properties. This focus led to continued increases in demand for safety and infection control product along with essential MRO items like appliances, HVAC, and water heaters. Our broad product assortment, competitive pricing, and excellent sales, and service execution were key drivers to each of these categories from factors in the company’s average.</p>
<p class="p p3">We continue to be encouraged by the initiation of deferred maintenance by our customers. The demand for less critical MRO items such as hardware, electrical, and lighting recovered slower than the previously mentioned categories as properties are executing their highest maintenance needs first. We do believe this is a short term trend and expect all of our MRO categories will return to normal demand levels as properties execute lower of their deferred maintenance backlog.</p>
<p class="p p3">Our property improvement team made solid gains throughout the quarter despite operating in an environment where unit turn demand was down significantly year over year. We believe the property improvement market will remain below prior year levels for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021 as they continued this moderate recovery.</p>
<p class="p p3">I was especially proud of the responsiveness and execution speed our team demonstrated to provide the support our customers required during the quarter. Our category management and supply chain teams partnered closely with our supplier partners across the globe to ensure product availability under key products needed to reopen living space facilities.</p>
<p class="p p3">Our marketing and customer trend groups responded quickly to the challenges facing our customers and developed helpful online tools and virtual training to provide critical know how to help with the safe operations of their facilities and finally our sales team and drivers provided incredible on site support to ensure each property needed to provide a clean and safe living environment to its residents. These efforts along with many others across our organization resulted in our team recording one of the highest ever voice over customers scores during any quarter. </p>
<p class="p p3">Moving on to Page 5. I will now discuss our performance across our four sales verticals. Our multifamily business saw a significant performance improvement throughout the second quarter with July and August delivering positive year over year sales growth despite safety and headwinds associated with lower summer unit turn demand. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">This vertical recovery was driven by consistent year over year order growth and strong sales execution that accelerated our average order value improvement as deferred maintenance was gradually initiated. We continue to be encouraged with the rate at which properties welcome our sales team back in site and residence becomes more comfortable with maintenance professionals entering their living space.</p>
<p class="p p4">The hospitality industry continues to show signs of improvement with the latest year over year growth in revenue per available room numbers reading better than minus 50% for the first time since March. Our hospitality team has done an outstanding job providing best in class sales support and service to our customers which has resulted in clear market share gains. We have every intention of retaining this customer share and are fully committed to supporting our hospitality customers recovery which we think will extend well into 2021.</p>
<p class="p p4">We are also excited to announce our newest supply partnership with Ecolab, the global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services. This partnership will position our team to better provide the products and solutions our hospitality and healthcare customers require to clean and sanitize their properties.</p>
<p class="p p4">Our healthcare team delivered a solid quarter despite seeing some of the lowest all time resident occupancy rates in senior care living facility. I applaud our team for pivoting quickly in the COVID environment and providing the service ad solutions needed by their customers.</p>
<p class="p p4">This quarter we have also shared results of our institutional verticals which announced similar sites to healthcare in terms of sales. Our institutional verticals primarily serves military housing, housing authority, and student housing customers with similar MRO needs as our multifamily vertical. This team has performed incredibly well throughout the COVID crisis delivering approximately 2% growth during in the second quarter and 14% in August. It is clear that our value proposition make a good fit for this customer segment and we look forward to expanding our presence in this sales vertical. I’m very encouraged by our improved results through August.</p>
<p class="p p4">Our team has made tremendous progress and remains fully committed to supporting our customers and our communities during this recovery.</p>
<p class="p p4">With that I will now hand the call over to Evan.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Evan Levitt</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Thank you, Brad and good morning, everyone. I’d like to start by addressing our announcement made on August 11th in regards to the sale of our Construction &amp; Industrial business. We currently expect the sales to close by the end of October subject to regulatory approval. The results of our Construction &amp; Industrial business will be reflected at a discontinued operation beginning in the third quarter of 2020 including the month of August.</p>
<p class="p p4">We are excited about the ability to completely focus on our Facilities Maintenance business, which has always been our most profitable and highest return business. We expect to use the estimated to $.25 billion net after tax and transaction cost proceeds from the sale of our Construction &amp; Industrial business to pay down debt, fund M&amp;A opportunities within the MRO living space market, and to repurchase the stock of HD Supply which we continue to believe is attractively priced.</p>
<p class="p p4">Turning to our second quarter results on Page 6, net sales decreased $72 million or 4.4% to $1.552 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $1.624 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Gross profit decreased $37 million or 5.8% to $596 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $633 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.</p>
<p class="p p4">Gross profit was 38.4% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, a decrease of approximately 60 basis points from 39% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. I will discuss the change in gross margin during the business unit discussion. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $6 million or 2.5% to $238 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to the $244 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was 15.3% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of approximately 30 basis points from 15% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">On Page 7, I will discuss the specific performance of our individual business units in more detail. Net sales for our Facilities Maintenance business were $761 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $830 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The sales decline was 8.3% as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.</p>
<p class="p p5">Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $17 million or 11.4% to $132 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $149 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was 70.3% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, down approximately 70 basis points from an 18% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.</p>
<p class="p p5">Facilities Maintenance gross margin declined by 120 basis points for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decline in gross margin rate was primarily result of shift in product mix with an unfavorable impact of approximately 90 basis points and to a lesser extent the highly competitive environment with customers carefully monitoring maintenance budgets.</p>
<p class="p p5">Our improving sales performance is being led by appliances HVAC, janitorial, and safety categories currently generating strong double-digit growth. These product categories are in high demand and we are working tirelessly to ensure adequate supply to support our customers to reopening activities. However, all four of these product categories have margins lower than the company average.</p>
<p class="p p5">The more traditional bricks fixed MRO categories of electrical, lighting, hardware, faucets, and window coverings continues to see a decline in year-over-year demand. The maintenance involved in these items has been less critical in the current environment and is being deferred as customers tighten their budgets and limit tenant interactions. We continue to believe that these categories will recover albeit at a slower pace, as deferred maintenance works and as unit turns improve.</p>
<p class="p p5">Moving to the Construction &amp; Industrial business, net sales for our Construction &amp; Industrial business was $793 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $795 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The sales decline in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was 0.3% as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.</p>
<p class="p p5">Adjusted EBITDA increased $11 million or 11.6% to $106 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $95 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 reflecting both enhancement of gross margin rate and disciplined cost control. Adjusted EBITDA was 13.4% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 of approximately 150 basis points from 11.9% to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.</p>
<p class="p p5">During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, Construction &amp; Industrial gross margins improved approximately 30 basis points, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Gross margin was benefited by favorable year-over-year rebar margins and a mix of product categories including the sale of safety products, which are a high margin category for our Construction &amp; Industrial business.</p>
<p class="p p5">Turning to page 8, in the last 12 months we generated $645 million of free cash flow, an increase of 15% year-over-year. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we generated $190 million of free cash flow. We invested $12 million in capital expenditures in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and we continue to estimate our ongoing annual capital expenditure requirements to be approximately 2% of annual sales, although our expectation for fiscal 2020 is to spend less in light of the COVID environment.</p>
<p class="p p5">In the second quarter, we paid cash income taxes of around $36 million. This included payments made in July for the first and second quarters of 2020, as the CARES Act provided for the deferral of estimated first quarter income tax payment until July. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter is approximately 25%. We expect that our ongoing effective tax rate will be approximately 26%. As of August 2, 2020 HD Supply's combined liquidity of $995 million was comprised of $71 million in cash and cash equivalents and $924 million of additional available borrowings.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">During the second quarter we repaid all borrowings on our revolving line of credit. We have increased our liquidity by $367 million from the start of the year entirely through operations, demonstrating our ability to generate strong cash flow even in a challenging economic environment. We have not entered into any new or expanded any existing credit facilities during fiscal 2020.</p>
<p class="p p6">Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage is 2.1 times. We did not purchase any shares in the second quarter under our most recently authorized $500 million share repurchase program. The full $500 million authorization remains available for us to execute. As I stated, we intend to use a significant portion of cash proceeds from the sales of our Construction &amp; Industrial business for the share repurchase activity. Our strong liquidity of nearly $1 billion and current repurchase authorization enables us to begin repurchasing shares prior to the close of the Construction &amp; Industrial sales.</p>
<p class="p p6">On Page 9, we provide second quarter 2020 monthly net sales performance as well as 2019 comparable. In May of 2020 we delivered sales of $431 million, a decrease in average daily sales of approximately 7.3% versus May of 2019. In June of 2020, we delivered sales of $495 million, a decrease in average daily sales of approximately 4.8% versus June of 2019.</p>
<p class="p p6">In July of 2020, we delivered sales of $626 million a decrease in average daily sales of approximately 2% versus July of 2019. They were 19 selling days in May, 20 selling days in June, and 24 selling days in July of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. August 2020, which ended August 30th was the first month of our fiscal third quarter 2020 and we have provided our preliminary sales results. We will not provide information on August results beyond sales.</p>
<p class="p p6">Combined preliminary net sales in August of 2020 were approximately $518 million, which represents year-over-year average daily sales decline of approximately 0.7%. Preliminary August year-over-year average daily net sales by business segments was an approximately 1.1% growth in Facilities Maintenance and an approximately 2.5% decline in Construction &amp; Industrial. There were 20 selling days in both August 2020 and August 2019.</p>
<p class="p p6">We have seen a steady improvement in our end markets, however as Brad pointed out we expect a relatively slow improvement in the hospitality and property improvement markets throughout the remainder of the year and into 2021. We will continue to strive for outgrowth in all of our end markets and we intend to retain for the long-term market share gains turns during the pandemic. However, at this time we will not be providing formal guidance.</p>
<p class="p p6">We believe there are still too many uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 environment. We will continue to share what we see in our business and in our markets, but we will not provide specific guidance until we see more stability. Looking ahead as a simple one line of business company, we are committed to enhancing our industry leading return on invested capital and free cash flow generation as well as demonstrating consistent sales in earnings growth.</p>
<p class="p p6">Our number one priority continues to be the health and safety of our associates and their families as well as our customers. We will continue to support our customers and communities by providing the critical products and services needed to maintain their facilities, care for their residence, and operate and maintain safe job sites and work environments.</p>
<p class="p p6">I would like to thank you for your continued interest in HD Supply and I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p6"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thanks, good morning. Recognizing that from you see have no guidance but these improvements in FM sales in July, August growth is very encouraging. Is there anything kind of unsustainable within those results might--kind of shift sales back into main territory in the back half of the year and taken maybe hospitality would pull back from where it was in August and perhaps safety servers are kind of help both of them to get prepared, is there anything that needs you to believe that maybe that puts growth might not be sustained through the back half of the year?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Brad Paulsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Nigel, good morning, this is Brad when we look back in the quarter our kind of success equations was pretty straightforward and the fact that we’re really focus on providing the service to our customers required, it was probably the most challenging times as seen in last decade at least. We never pulled back on our service or sales support and we got relatively very, very strong product availability and incredibly consistent next day execution and positioned ourselves and right safe most dependable option in our space and because of that we were able to generate positive result through the quarter.</p>
<p class="p p7">I would say that we’re picking up customers shares and then we also saw end markets starting to improve, they did not get all the way back but they starting to enter--our customers started--some of that deferred maintenance. So, between the order growth that we saw and I really strong sales execution and help accelerate that average order value recovery, it was easier to see why we saw that improvement through the course of the quarter now.</p>
<p class="p p7">When we look at the rest of the year, we’re certainly moving forward in a very cautious manner--some of the things we’re watching from a macro perspective and trying to couple them occupancy and hospitality and healthcare especially hospitality, I think everybody has seen that there is been a nice improvement with summer and now the kids are back in school.</p>
<p class="p p7">We will see how that plays out and then healthcare, the healthcare continues to have a serious headwinds as far as people living in senior care living facilities, we feel really good overall though I would tell you about our ability to drive growth in our business and about 80% of our sales in the team and all of our non hospitality vertical really does an exceptional job, again in a really, really tough environment.</p>
<p class="p p7">The last headwind that I would call out is property improvement and I shared my prepared remarks and definitely feel like that is going to continue to be down year-over-year, in our last call I said we lost a lot of that track windows of getting on-site, getting out of job and now we're at a point that were just less people moving, so less opportunity to unit turns and over 10% of our business that is going to be another headwind that we're going to deal with. Overall, I couldn’t be more proud of the team's execution in support of our customers during the past quarter.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Great. Well thanks, Brad. That's very helpful information. My follow up question is really around the FM on a go forward basis. I’m thinking about the leverage. Right now you're at 2.1 times, you're range of 2.2 to 2.3 times. FM is a higher margin business expanding than capital. How you’re thinking about the leverage ratio for FM on a go forward basis?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Evan Levitt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yeah so Nigel the two to three times as you know is a net debt to EBITDA ratio. Obviously with the sale of Construction &amp; Industrial, we will receive quite a bit of cash over the coming months, and so on a net debt to EBITDA basis, we will be well below that two to three times until we can deploy that cash. We outlined on the call that we expect to deploy that cash. We will pay down some debt, some gross debt, and then we’ll also look to fund our M&amp;A opportunities, and repurchase stock.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">A good portion of cash proceeds will be used to repurchase stocks and that will be over time, so we’ll be below, or at that bottom end of that two to three times net debt to EBITDA for a period of time here. Looking longer term we still think that two to three times is about the right range where we want to be.</p>
<p class="p p8">And certainly we are comfortable at the higher end of two to three times with the predictable cash flow of our Facilities Maintenance business as evidenced by the cash flow we were able to generate in the first half of this year. But we also are not afraid to keep some dry powder to remain opportunistic for opportunities that present themselves or that we want to pursue</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay thanks, Evan.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thank you. And our next question comes from with your line Keith Hughes from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Keith Hughes</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thank you. There has been a lot of on again, off again talk on stimulus for consumers. It really impacts lower end consumers, which will be more in your multifamily occupancy. Are you hearing anymore commentary from your multifamily customers about rising delinquency on payments, that impact on spending? Any sort of big picture view on that market you could give would be helpful?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So Keith we’ve certainly seen a slight uptick in the timeliness of rent payments that’s been well published throughout the second quarter and then in August in particular the most recent data that we’ve got available. Rent recollections were down about 200 basis points year over year, so we continue to monitor this. You’re correct that much of the stimulus that was put in place by the Federal government in the first half has run its course. There is some additional unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="p p8">It varies state-by-state at this point and there is on again off again talks with Washington, so we don't know whether anything will come out of that. We do monitor it very closely. And this is likely a headwind that we’re seeing in the property improvement business that Brad previously mentioned. Certainly our customers will tighten their maintenance budgets and look at discretionary spend which property improvement is a discretionary spend in that type of environment.</p>
<p class="p p8">That being said, we’ve been relatively pleased thus far with the reaction of our customers, as well the quality of our own our receivable portfolio. As you know in the first quarter we took a charge to increase the conservativeness of our reserve [indiscernible]. We think that was still appropriate and we still hold on to that additional reserve. But to this point we’ve been very pleased with the quality of that portfolio, but we’re monitoring it just like you are as you indicated that we could see some additional headwinds in the back half of the year with less government stimulus.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Brad Paulsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">And I would add then. This has been a day to day, week to week, month to month conversation with our customers really since the onset of COVID and we’re at a point now where maintenance needs to be done. I think Evan’s right. People are going to be very cautious to see what’s around the corner, but this work needs to be done and we talk Brexit versus unit turns.</p>
<p class="p p8">We're very optimistic about what Brexit will look like going forward and I think the next few months given there is going to be a week-to-week review, but in all the customer conversations I have been having, having quite a few. The way that they have been framed, yes, it's a point of caution, but the Brexit turned out much better than thought it would three to four months ago, so it’s still full steam ahead. We’ll watch it closely and continue to provide that service to the customers, as they execute that for maintenance.</p>

<p class="p p8">Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is now open.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Hamzah Mazari</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Hey good morning. Thank you. You had referenced using some of the proceeds from C&amp;I for M&amp;A in the FM business. Are there any verticals outside of the ones that you’re in today that are attractive, that may have synergies with your existing end markets? And maybe touch on also how valuations look like for assets as well? </p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Evan and I we’ll take this question. I’ll say in our core markets that we’re in today operate in very fragmented markets. We view that as a great opportunity for us to be active in M&amp;A going forward. We feel like we’re the natural acquirer, given the skill that we have, and the customer relationships that were in place. And I would say that description applies to all of the verticals that we operate in today. We feel like there is a number of different fantastic opportunities in front of us. As far as new channels I would answer it that way. Evan you can discuss that.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Evan Levitt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes certainly, Hamzah, we’re looking at acquisition opportunities within our existing channels, but we do look for opportunities to enhance our position not certainly in new channels, but with new products, or new service offerings to our existing customers to better serve them. We also look for opportunities where we can become more integrated with our customers at workflow, so that we can be more relevant to them.</p>
<p class="p p9">So it is a wide variety of the type of acquisitions that we may be looking for and in all cases we look for value, so you asked about value. In general we would look to do an acquisition for a multiple lower than that which we trade at, and then look to pay down that multiple further through synergies, so we’re going to buy a company that we think we can add value to, and improve either through acceleration in growth, reduction in cost, or acceleration and enhancement of margin.</p>
<p class="p p9">Then we also look for reverse synergies, where is there an acquisition target that does something particularly well that either we don't do today or don't do this as well as we would like that we can learn from and expand that know how across the balance of our business. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color around the type of acquisitions that we’re looking for.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Hamzah Mazari</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">That is very helpful and just my follow up question just on FM. Could you maybe comment on how much maybe urban exposure you have within that segment. I know you generally stay away from high rise buildings, but I would have thought that the Brexit type work would have picked up a lot more with reopening trends, because it doesn't seem like a massive ticket item. I realized you touched on hospitality as being depressed and that's sort of apparent, but just any color you can give. Would you have thought this would have picked up a bit earlier? And then just any thoughts on your urban exposure within FM? Thank you. </p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes, Hamzah we don't specifically break out urban versus suburban, or rural exposure, however as you implied, our sweet spot is really in – is outside of the city centers in the suburban parts of the country, so we do have some customers that we support in New York City, or Chicago in the high rise, and mid-rise areas, but that's not our sweet spot. Our sweet spot is the garden style apartment complexes two to four stories multiple buildings in a complex.</p>
<p class="p p9">As far as your question on maintenance picking up, we are starting to see it pickup, and improve. Much of the demand that we’re seeing in appliances and water heaters that has become a great fix item. With people staying at home, kids at home, those appliances are getting used more than ever, and so they are requiring repairs and replacement as a break fix item. Items that may have historically been required in next day repair, broken blinds in the living room, dripping faucets.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10">Some of those repairs are waiting more than a day as our customers prioritize what needs to be done first. And as tenants becomes more comfortable allowing a maintenance professional, a professional into their living space. And so that is improving. Folks are becoming more willing to allow somebody into their living space, but it’s not that normal.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Thank you. Our next question comes from Julianne Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Hey good morning, everyone. This is Jack for Julian. Maybe digging deeper into some of the gross margin dynamics you talked to with some Facilities Maintenance. You mentioned a competitive environment is kind of serving as a headwind right now. How much of that is sort of attributed just to the broader environment now versus some of the market share gaining efforts that you guys have talked to on the call? And sort of how are you balancing trying to capture more share with kind of maintaining these margins and then sort of pricing and all that’s kind of digging into that?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yeah so to unpack it a little bit for you as we shared. The category, the unfavorable category mix is a headwind of about 90 basis points of the 120 basis points total. We’re also seeing about 20 basis points of like tariff headwind where we haven't completely anniversaried the tariffs from last year as of the end of the second quarter.</p>
<p class="p p10">Favorably impacting the margin rate is the mix of hospitality, so hospitality is a lower margin verticals for us. It is still down even in the month of August about 14% and that's about 40 to 50 basis points of benefit in the margin, the margin walk, or the margin change. And the difference is primarily that the competitive environment and ensuring that we’re price right everyday and offering compelling value to our customers.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Perfect. And then is there any update on kind of e commerce. I know you mentioned sort of last quarter that 75% of sales are kind of on digital platforms and so on. Any kind of additional puts, and takes there, or any sort of headwinds, or tailwinds that that might generate?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">No that continues to be a real strength for our business. We continue to invest in both our web platforms. I have received really fantastic feedback from our customers as far as saving them time and money and giving m maintenance back to the maintenance professional, so no headwinds. And like I said its definitely something that we’re viewing as a competitive advantage. </p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Brad Paulsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">I also think the digital integration you’ve done with customer to help them reopen, so the webinar have been sold out and the ability for you to provide these value via the knowledge on how to do this right I think has been highly integrated highly digitalized.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Deane Dray</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to circle back on hospitality again and just to make sure I have the numbers right. They’re down 14% for FM versus down 55.0% for the industry, so you made it sound like this was all share gains which would be terrific, but if you could provide us some more context there on the dynamics.</p>
<p class="p p10">Have competitors shut down? Are you to have an edge in providing more services? And then is there any benefit from and this first part of Nigel's question, some one time like replenishment that came through in the quarter that would have skewed that number favorably. So can we start there please?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Sure, so you hit the nail on my head, as I said in my first answer we haven't pulled back in our service or support to our customers especially the hospitality customers and I would say that is not the case with other competitors across the business and I think when you pair that with strong in stock position and the availability to deliver consistent next day service really across the country, it attracted a lot of new customers that we are working business with.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p11">So, while we saw a relatively good performance from orders, order increases--average order value did not increase all that much through the course of the quarter which is now there are suddenly popped through the quarter as people prepared for different some holidays and things of that nature, but we really view this as our team is providing level of service that wasn't being matched our competition and because of that we picked up on market share.</p>
<p class="p p11">Now as far as do we see any initial surge in orders--we're still kind of dissecting that as you can imagine the last three months and last four months in hospitality have been unlike any other that we have seen and last five to six years, but what we are seeing is customers that we didn't do business with that grade level are now coming to and asking to actually provide services and product which is handed down in the past.</p>
<p class="p p11">And that with existing customers I would say slow but steady improvement nothing that would tell us that the recovery is going to be shorter than what we expected but what we really watching is what happens and like I said earlier host Labor Day, I think that’s going to be really interesting to see both from select service and full service and see how that customer returns back and that we are still certainly in the camp of it is going to be made to late 2021 before we see hospitality return to normal levels. And I hopefully that answers your questions. </p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Deane Dray</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">It did that was really helpful color and some of the competitive dynamics I appreciate that and then the second question is on the C&amp;I divestitures. So, first of all congratulations it looks like a favorable outcome for everybody and you're putting it in strong hands with--the business in strong hands with Clayton, Dubilier but just the and maybe you can take us through expectations regarding taking out stranded cost, what the timing of that would be, and especially for the third quarter modeling purposes I know you're not giving guidance but how much residual expense might still be in the reported results, operating results and what's the plan there? Thanks.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Yeah, thanks Deane. So our expectation is still that the incremental are stranded cost is about 30 to 60 basis points of revenue. We do expect to recover that over time as we grow as we leverage fixed cost and as we become more efficient. So, over the next 12 to 24 months I hope that we will recover that 30 to 60 basis points of incremental cost or stranded cost but that 30 to 60 basis points is real and we will see it in the third quarter, as a reminder to everybody that third quarter is the first quarter where we will show Construction &amp; Industrial business as a discontinued operation.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Deane Dray</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Great and just last comment, look this has been unprecedented times here and Joe and her team I just think your organization response has been really impressive, you guys are really on the frontlines, and how you have adapted and responded and I specially appreciate how you supported the community with donating the VPN and so just wanted to add my congrats. Thanks.</p>

<p class="p p11">Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">David Manthey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Thanks, good morning. Along the same lines standalone FM may be give any thoughts and if you can give us any guidance in terms of the split of depreciation and amortization and what that might be on for the standalone FM business?</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Sure, I can give a little bit of color on that Dave. So, facility with on standalone post split we will see depreciation amortization--one moment here about $70 million to $80 million a year.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">David Manthey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Okay, thank you and second could you describe the status of the information systems, infrastructure at FM when you think CRM, finance, HR, WMS are all of the systems 100% consistent and stable at the FM business today or do you have some projects that you need to work on?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Well, our core system within the Facilities Maintenance and will be FAP that is a stable platform that we have operated for many years and we will continue to operate. The work that we do right now relative to the separation is more on the back-office functions, our HR apparel system currently on and we do need is a share platform right now with Facilities Maintenance and Construction &amp; Industrial and so we are working on separating this.</p>
<p class="p p12">But by large our systems are stable and we have on them for a number of years. We're always making enhancements and improvements to them, but we will be doing so in bite-size chunks so that we are able to add and test and have fallback position should we have any issues with any changes or improvements there.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">David Manthey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Great, thanks Evan.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Ryan Merkel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Hey, thanks for fitting me in. I guess first off thinking about FM longer term because of the pandemic are you planning to make any changes in the business model in terms of how you go-to-market, product assortment, or technology?</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">I would say those are one big change that we have made is really building out our safety in infection prevention product assortment, in pre-COVID we really didn't have a business but would address that what capital management team has just done a miraculous job, adding a number of new suppliers, hundreds of new SKUs, and all that really positions us to be the one-stop shop for all those products and that is important because I don't think that demand is going to go away, I think it may well over time but I think you're going to be a big part of our business going forward.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Ryan Merkel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Yeah, I agree. Okay.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">I would also say that certainly customers today would prefer less interactions and so one truck that has everything on it is a big deal and we're going to really make sure as we remarket relaunch FM we can do everything for you and it is best for you if we do everything for you.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Ryan Merkel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Yeah, also a good point. Okay same question I know you're not giving guidance and this is frankly hard to answer, but how should we think about FM market growth potential until the economy fully reopens. Is it flat or reasonable outlook for the next couple of quarters or with pent-up demand hit the market return to low single-digit growth?</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Yeah, so Ryan we’re always striving to outgrowth in market and we think we are doing that significantly right now, it is difficult to estimate where the market is today, and where it's headed particularly with the hospitality market as Brad discussed. We saw some nice improvement in hospitality over the course of the second quarter, as we saw leisure travel pickup, so we saw folks taking their summer vacations driving rather than flying but still traveling close to home and staying away from home.</p>
<p class="p p12">Our business travel has not picked up like leisure travel has so post Labor Day that's the nature of Brad's discussion around potential headwinds in the back half. Difficult to say when that we'll come back, I think the market will still be down in the second half, again we will make every attempts to outgrow the market. We are able to deliver a positive comp in August, it is our intention to continue to improve over the course of the year but it may not be every month we have a setback here and there, as we are still in very uncertain environment and the virus is still unpredictable.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Ryan Merkel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Yes, understood, very helpful. Thank you.</p>

<p class="p p12">Thank you our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Chris Dankert</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Hey good morning guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess one year on year obviously the Atlanta DC operating very well but just we speak to customer recovery in the region is that where we wanted to be year on what’s the opportunity to kind of still kind of recapture some of that lost share in that specific region just any thoughts on that dynamic.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">We are definitely pleased with the recovery that we are seeing in that market absolutely applaud the leadership with that DC that really turned it around and in a really short period of time and providing what I consider is best in class service for the customers in that region. Our efforts to recover and also take share or earn share in that market is never over and we are going to have that mindset every day, every month going forward. </p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Chris Dankert</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Yes fair, fair. And then I guess switching back to Ryan's question of that as you move into your hopeful growth mode herein are there any additional initiatives to highlight beyond that safety build-out are we talking about headcount expansion, is it geographic build-out I mean I understand there is competitive intelligence issues here, but just any additional growth initiatives that you would be able to call out here?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Well it's a great question and we certainly have that planned out and share it in full detail on today's call, but I think the first thing that we can do and I mentioned it earlier in the call is really establish ourselves as the safest most dependable option in our space. And if you talk to our customers dependability, is their number one need and nothing really comes close to that.</p>
<p class="p p13">So, our ability to do that on consistent level there’s a lot that goes into that, it’s easier to say hard to do and if we can do that on a consistent basis, we’ll absolutely pick up share of the property level and have also been really open saying that we’re going to aggressively pursue new national accounts customers, we think we’ve got a value propositions are very unique for them and we have seen great success really over the last I would say 9 to 10 months in that activity and we’re going to continue to invest in business and we haven't called out the both 2% of our revenue would go into investing into the core business to continue to improve our value proposition, so, I'm really excited to see the business of all certainly in the second half and as we move into 2021.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Brad Paulsen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Yeah I think you are seeing a very nice just natural extensions of our replay for that consistent investment right sized accounts to be able to make a difference and I think you are seeing that really through the VOC that you posted through the pandemic so I think clearly being the safest and most reliable option out there is, is core and there’s a ton of share to gain by doing that.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Chris Dankert</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Understood thanks so much guys and best of luck into the fall here.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Just a question on FM, I just as part of the HVAC I think was that lot of people are not paying rents and so I understand how it was for them certain verticals but just in your core multifamily vertical office buildings how is this dynamics sort of impacting your customers longer term CapEx clients, what kind of discussions are you having with them?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">So, it's a conversation we had quite a bit. With our unit turn business being down, property improvement being down and we’re trying to get a pulse for how our customers are feeling about it and again as I just shared kind a lot of conversations with customer right now their expectations that worse going to get done their mindset is rent delinquent is actually lower than they anticipated and we’ll see how it plays out as there is a lack of a stimulus that would impact the second half but right now our all communications that we’re receiving is capital investments will happen at the very latest in 2021 some might even sneak into the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Oh well, that's good news and then of course I know you guys are [indiscernible] C&amp;I and congratulations on the deal. Can you just give us I think you did it last time just go over to markets California, Texas, Florida, North-East, what are you guys seeing in terms of such big market trends?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Specific to the construction business?</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="question">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Yes, certainly happy to see for the entire company, but also specifically for C&amp;I as well, yes.</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">So, okay well I’ll discuss the construction business first. So, certainly we are seeing very localized trends within the construction business, it is a very local market, certain markets continue to perform well like the Southeast part of the United States.</p>
<p class="p p14">We’re seeing continued strong demand in our infrastructure tech project, road and bridge airports, a number of soccer stadiums being built around the country and so these are in some of the markets like in Atlanta like in Nashville, Chicago, Boston remain strong, other markets remain a little weaker folks that don't have that infrastructure spend and maybe a little slower either slower to reopen or have additional constraints around a job site activity.</p>
<p class="p p14">Well a lot of jobsites have resumed work many locations limit the amount of folks that work on a jobsite at a time, so we’re seeing one or two trades on a job at a time and so that’s showing progress on those jobs and so really is very regional, regional impact market by market on the construction business. </p>
<p class="p p14">As far as facilities and maintenance we are seeing nice improvement sequentially month-over-month, as we shared through August I’d say right now that the Easter half of the United States is a little ahead of the Western half of the United States, in terms of recovery in our markets.</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="question">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">That sounds amazing. Thank you very much congratulations on a great quarter.</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Thank you and our next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="question">Michael McGinn</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Hi thank you everyone. Just going back to the average order size, I think in the second quarter you mentioned this in your prepared remarks, in there any way to frame this from a year-over-year perspective and that may be how that leads into your freight and routes enter the equation and the way you're looking at maybe gross profit for invoice any commentary there would be great.</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Yes, so certainly it does put pressure on cost per delivery and even handling costs within our distribution centers. When you’ve got the same number of orders but there are smaller orders there’s still an apparent level of cost that’s incurred to pick-pack close out the orders, load it on a truck, deliver it and then bill and collect it. So, you are spot on that that does put pressure on the financial profile the average order size has improved as we’ve moved through the year. It was down double digits earlier at the end of the first quarter and early second quarter. It’s now back down to single digit so it is improving, but it is still below last year.</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="question">Michael McGinn</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Okay and then just on the margins, I think incremental’s you mentioned last quarter you were targeting 25% to 30% decremental range I mean with the co-cost now on the table, is that a different target out there any updates that you can provide?</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Yeah it’s hard to provide that type of update given that August was up slightly up 1% so we’re we worked around that flat mark. Incrementals or decrementals become less relevant, we do expect to see some continued pressure on gross margin so we saw that 100 basis points plus gross margin pressure within Facilities Maintenance primarily because of mix.</p>
<p class="p p14">That will likely continue at least into the third quarter as we continue to see the high demand categories being the categories whose margin is below the company average and so there will continue to be some pressure on operating margins as we work hard to offset that margin pressure and the margin pressure related to mix we believe is short term that will recover, the competitive nature of the marketplace will continue.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p15"><strong><span class="question">Michael McGinn</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p15">Okay and if I could sneak one more in regarding the multifamily market. You guys do a superb job meeting the needs of the class A professionally managed multifamily markets on the other hand, do you see just a synergistic benefit of operating within a larger organization and able to meet that class B or class C multifamily profit or those spend characteristics too dissimilar from each other where it is a non factor? </p>
<p class="p p15"><strong><span class="answer">Joe DeAngelo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p15">I’d say we have covered all properties all the way through and we think that we are in a very focused business model is the best way to do that cause we understand the needs and we understand the different varying needs based on their property economics. So, I think we can cover the full waterfront and we can cover it really, really well by being absolutely focused on just that living space market.</p>
