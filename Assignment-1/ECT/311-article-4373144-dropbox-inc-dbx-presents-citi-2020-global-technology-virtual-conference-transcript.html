<p class="p p1"><strong>Walter Pritchard</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">All right. Hi, it's Walter Pritchard. I'm Software Analyst here at Citi. Happy to have Tim Regan with us. He is the Chief Accounting Officer and the incoming CFO of Dropbox. And I was going to go -- we also have Rob Bradley [ph], who's the Head of IR on the line as well, if needed.</p>
<p class="p p1">And I was going to go through some questions I had prepared. And there is a window off to the left in your conference panel there, that gives anybody connected on an opportunity to send us questions. So, I can take those when you send them. And you can also email me if that works better.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, again, Tim, thanks. Thanks a lot for joining.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Tim Regan</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">You bet. Nice to be here.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Walter Pritchard</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. So, I guess where I wanted to start is where we started with most companies here, just reviewing and sort of looking forward at what's happened in this COVID work-from-home environment? What sort of puts and takes to be seen in the business? And how do you expect it to play out as we look into the rest of the year and beyond?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes, great question. I think we've been really fortunate, honestly. Our CEO, Drew, talked about this as being a dramatic change, similar to the shift to the cloud or mobile. So this move to work-from-home is definitely a moment. And we think that our product is well-suited to the remote distributed work environment. Certainly, something we've been working on for a long time, keeping files and teams in sync anywhere, anytime. And so, it's really lucky for us to have a product that fits this moment.</p>
<p class="p p1">And I think we're seeing that, as far as trials, where individuals and team trials were up 20% relative to pre-COVID levels, and conversion rates of those trials has remained steady. And churn has been stable throughout this time. And another space is HelloSign, this is the e-signature and document workflow company that we acquired last year. We're really the alternative of pen and paper which is still how most people execute on us on signing. The alternative of pen and paper is not only not feasible, it's just not healthy right now.</p>
<p class="p p1">And so that gives us a large opportunity to pursue where usage of HelloSign is up 25% relative to pre-COVID levels. So seeing strong activity on the trial side of both core Dropbox and HelloSign. And then the new Dropbox, which is our smart workspace that we've introduced in this last year. Engagement on that is up 100,000 users, sequentially.</p>
<p class="p p1">So now 450,000 out of our 500,000 business teams are using the new Dropbox, as they are figuring out how to engage with their employees and colleagues in this work-from-home environment. So strong top of the funnel momentum.</p>
<p class="p p1">And then it's also honestly been helpful on the profitability front. And we had a quarter, last quarter where we did operating margins of 20.5%, and that was about double what we did last year. And some of that is due to savings on things like travel, events and other areas.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, for the most part I think we've been fortunate, as far as having a product that's resonating well in the market, and a team that's been able to produce at high levels, leading to additional efficiencies on the bottom line.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Got it. And maybe, I wanted to come back and talk about the new smart workspace offering which is sort of independent of COVID. But curious what you talked about HelloSign interactions, for example up a lot with COVID. What other sort of beyond just trial usage and so forth? What other changes in behavior or new behaviors have you seen relative to your installed base, in terms of how they interact with Dropbox in these conditions we're seeing right now where everybody's working from home?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Sure, good question. Well, I think to your point on HelloSign, I think that that is definitely one area that that's doing very well. And one of the points of interaction, we introduced a new capabilities here in this last quarter, where now it's a very native and deep integration, where just now you can send for a signature one of your documents. And you have three free and then you hit a pay wall.</p>
<p class="p p2">And so, we're seeing strong traction in that e-signature space, hardly due to this more native integration. And we've also gone live in international locations where in the past it had been only available domestically. But now we're live in 21 additional languages to take advantage of this international opportunity. So, I think to your point on HelloSign, I think that is a space that we're seeing a strong traction.</p>
<p class="p p2">And then one other, maybe interesting point to note is just the fact that people use Dropbox not just for their work lives, but for their home lives. And so I think about my own experience where I could go from talking to an investor or talking to a member of our management team in one moment, and then the next moment, I'm chasing the kids to go clean up something that they've spilled in the kitchen, right? So, I'm constantly toggling back and forth between work and home.</p>
<p class="p p2">And so this is where we've introduced some new features and functionality. And I think of things like passwords, which stores and syncs your passwords across devices. We launched that in the second quarter. And Vault, which secures and organizes your most important personal documents and things like your wills or your trust, where you can now give a pin to your family member to help with that information. Computer backup which automatically backs up your Mac or your PC. And the family plan, we introduced that in this last quarter.</p>
<p class="p p2">So, one pattern we're seeing is this blend of work in home. And so this is where we're introducing features and functionality to capture that experience and capture that moment. And this is part of our strategy to move people from basic users, move them into this individual space, where we're solving their personal problems, and then we can continue to migrate them towards our team solutions. So just a few examples, as far as blend of work at home and the HelloSign opportunity that you mentioned.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">And one question already came in here that's relevant to the discussion we're having right here is, the free user base, the 600 million users has been a big driver of your paid business. What -- are you seeing any changes in behavior in that base around usage or churn? And how do you look at the potential propensity for those uses to upgrade now versus pre-COVID? Has there been any anything notable there or any strategy you have Dropbox has to try to monetize those customers more so than in the past?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes, great question. And to the questions point, we do have over 600 million of basic users, right? So 600 million people familiar with our product and using our product. And so it's up to us to keep introducing these new features and functionality to move them along into our paid usage state and then from individuals and into teams. And so we continue to see a mix of teams and individuals come into the top of the funnel. And we continue to see strong top of the funnel attraction that I mentioned that the trials that we're seeing and a lot of the other metrics that we're seeing are consistent with pre-COVID levels, particularly as far as our conversion rates and churn rates.</p>
<p class="p p2">And so certainly, we are closely monitoring these trends to figure out how are customers using us. How can we continue to introduce features and functionality that solve their challenges, and both retain them and then continue to drive them up to our premium SKUs?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Got it. One market that you've talked more about recently, including on the last conference call, a couple large transactions, was the education market. And I think that's been a market for the company for a long time. Is there something now that's driving more monetization there? And how do you look at the sort of goal of those types of customers? They sort of cross the professional personal boundary that you've already referred to?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, good question. We've certainly seen strong success in the EDU vertical. A few quarters ago, we closed a deal with Kuene [ph]. We've also closed deals with Oregon, Arizona and the University of Michigan, the deal we closed last quarter.</p>
<p class="p p3">And so if you think about it again, this COVID experience that that we're all dealing with, students and faculty need a place to share content back and forth. Certainly not as easy as the old days of just handing in your paper. And so this is another solution, this is another vertical that that we've seen accelerate in this COVID moment. And we think it's a great strategy for us because it seeds are our future users.</p>
<p class="p p3">And I think about my own way of using products, if I'm already using a product and storing my content in it and getting more acquainted with the ecosystem and figuring out the features and functionality that I enjoy within a product, I'm more likely to stay. And so as we're procuring these users in this COVID student state, as they exit, we have that advantage to convert them into paid users on our individual plans and ultimately our team plans as they exit the university life.</p>
<p class="p p3">And then there's the virility angle, right? As they become more familiar with our products and are using it more, they'll share their content with family and friends and introduce Dropbox to their own personal ecosystem, if you will. So we think this is ultimately very accretive to ARR and something we will continue to pursue.</p>
<p class="p p3">And some ways that we're working on enhancing that experience is through partnerships with learning tools such as, blackboard and canvas. So we're figuring out, hey, what are the tools that the faculty and students use to interact with each other. And then engaging with partnerships just to make that experience stronger, to really help solve their challenges.</p>
<p class="p p3">And then one other angle to it, of course, is oversight controls, where university officials and others just want to make sure that the content is secure and safe. And so this is where we've enabled security and administrative controls to manage users and monitor activity.</p>
<p class="p p3">So, doing everything we can to solve for the challenges of our users, both whether it's the students or it's the faculty or whether it's the administrators. And this is something that is a strategy we think is going to help us in the long-term.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And how do you think about from the free user base? There are some users who will, probably never pay you anything. And then there's some who are pretty quick maybe to pay and start a trial for a period of time. How important is it to improve the yield of those free users for the company versus how much of a tolerances are over the long-term to have a very, very large base of free users that, maybe you never monetize and monetize in the foreseeable future?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, that's great for us to have this large user base, that gives us a great opportunity to understand how are people using the tool, how are people using their content, and that helps us educate where to take our product going forward. And so that's helped us figure out how to launch some of these new features and functionality passwords involved. And this is sort of feedback we're getting from customers to say this is what would be useful for us. And that gives a signal as to what to release and then what potentially can drive conversion down the road.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">And so I think that that's one massive advantage. And so one other I'd say is, if you look at our acquisitions, right, having this 600 million users with HelloSign, now we can leverage that user base and we have this built-in distribution network. And this is where we can introduce some of these new features and capabilities that, again, can resonate.</p>
<p class="p p4">And maybe one other angle that I can mention is, this focus on content and the strength in content, we have these AI-capabilities as well, that, as I'm going to a meeting, for example, I can say I have a meeting with Drew. Our system can see, hey, these are some documents that you've been collaborating on with your CEO, and whether it's a board deck et cetera, and surface the right content for me at the right time, as it sees what's on my calendar, and what content is perhaps most relevant to that situation.</p>
<p class="p p4">So having this user base really helps us cultivate our future roadmap. It helps us cultivate potential M&amp;A opportunities. It helps give us this opportunity to expand down the line within paid users. And I can talk about if you'd like on the infrastructure side, just how we try to manage our costs as well.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I guess that would be I guess, that would be helpful, especially, I think one thing that's happened there is couple years ago, you moved on to your own infrastructure. I think costs were a part of that. Maybe you could help us understand where we are in that benefit cycle of having made the move and be in a couple -- maybe 18 months out from that move?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. So to your point, a few years ago we did shift away from AWS onto our own infrastructure. And that gives us the opportunity to innovate and optimize our gross margin profile. And so, a few things we've done there, we've introduced this SMR technology, shingled magnetic recording, which is the layering of disk drives that store data. And one way I think about it is, is almost shingles on a roof. </p>
<p class="p p4">So they're layered on top of each other, which reduces the space required and increases storage density per disk by 75%. And so half of our storage is leveraging SMR as of the second quarter. And so that's one point of innovation that is helping to drive our efficiency there.</p>
<p class="p p4">Another is this cold storage, where we've analyzed the usage patterns of how people are accessing their content. And certain content that they access at low frequency rates, we can store at lower cost levels.</p>
<p class="p p4">So, these points of innovation that we've been able to drive is due in part due to owning our own infrastructure. And that's where we're delivering 79% margins this year, and a long-term target 78% to 80%. So we are doing quite well, as far as driving efficiencies along that space.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">And from that perspective, when you highlight that half of your storage is on the SMR technology, is the conclusion there then that the other half to go there and that there's further potential for improvement? Or how should we think about sort of where you are on that curve of benefiting from having made this decision?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. Good question, Walter. Yes, we're on the path. It does require some level of exploration or call it the existing equipment, and then you shift into the new equipment. So, there's a bit of a cycle to it. But we're definitely on the path. And it will continue to grow from the 50% that is today, to much higher percentages over time, just as we go through our refresh cycles, if you will.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So that as we think about, you're already at 79% margin, you're sort of already within that band, and you've highlighted as a long-term goal. What are the -- it sounds like over time, there are additional investments that you would be making to offset some of those savings. Or how should we think about maybe as the rest of that storage doesn't move through this new technology? Wouldn't that drive you in excess of the range that you've talked about?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, good question. We will need to continue to invest in this space. And so we'll -- whether it's -- we just did a new infrastructure up in Portland, a new data center up in Portland. So that's one way we've invested. And then we're also thinking about whether it's international investment, there's new regulations, whether it's GDPR or rather that that might warrant us building out new infrastructure in areas more and more regionalized. And so there's more investment to come here.</p>
<p class="p p5">And so we're not lifting those long-term targets from 70% to 80%. We're not lifting those just yet, something that I will certainly be looking at with my team, as we think about call it our guidance for next year. But no immediate plans to lift that target right now.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Got it. And then on, you brought it up earlier and I was going to return to it on the smart work. The smart workspace or the new desktop experience. I think the majority of your users have moved there.</p>
<p class="p p5"> How many of them have actually sort of changed the behavior that they have with the application? I mean, some of this was just a move that that was made on the back end. Could you help us understand sort of what's changed from the users’ perspective? And how are you seeing that change, how they interact with Dropbox?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure. So their engagement, so not only have call it 90% of our teams adopted it. Engagement is up 60% from pre-COVID levels, and so they are using it. And maybe to take a step back as far as what is the new Dropbox?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure, it'll be good.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So it's aimed at solving the problem of fragmentation in your workday. So right now, our content is scattered. We don't know where to find our various documents and whether it's a cloud doc or a Microsoft doc or Adobe, Google, content is everywhere. And we are constantly toggling between tools, whether it's our Slack or Zoom or Atlassian or Dropbox, constantly bouncing around between tools.</p>
<p class="p p5">And particularly in this time, we don't necessarily know what our teams are up to. We don't know what they're working on. We don't know what they're focused on. We don't know what documents they're engaged with. And so the idea from the new Dropbox is to help solve for that fragmentation of your work experience and bring focus to your day. And so we bring together your content, right, so your cloud docs and Microsoft and Google, everything is in Dropbox.</p>
<p class="p p5">Your tools, you can go to Dropbox, and natively launch Slack, you can launch Zoom, you can launch Atlassian. So you can use all your tools, all within Dropbox. And you can see what your teams are up to, whether it's the documents they're operating in, or what they're commenting on, et cetera.</p>
<p class="p p5">So this is what we launched in the back-half of last year and to what we talked about its 90% adopted across our teams. And that was our main goal this year is to drive adoption. So we are definitely continuing to monitor how customers are using it to figure out okay, now how do we evolve the product to make it even more useful. And our Head of product Timothy talks about trying to make this a toothbrush experience, where you wake up and you use it then you go to bed and you use it, and you've been using it throughout your day.</p>
<p class="p p5">And this is where we are looking to launch another update and iteration to the product in the back-half of the year. So stay tuned for that. And one of my main focuses is okay, now what does this mean for monetization.</p>
<p class="p p5">And so, we -- one angle to it is better conversion and better retention, right, as more people are using your product, more likely to stay and more likely to convert. But then there's also this concept of the foreground canvas, where with the new Dropbox, if I'm playing in it every day, and this is what I see as a user of it, is that now I can easily see what are the features and functionality that might be pertinent to me, and it might be useful to me.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">So, I can natively click on this HelloSign as an example. I can see okay, I'm in this doc, I want to get it signed. So I send it for signature and I go through this free and then hit a pay wall. So, we have this foreground experience where now people can actively see what </p>
<p class="p p6">Dropbox can do for them. And they can see do I want to transfer a document, do I want to send it for signature, do I want to scan a document, all these sorts of tools that people didn't necessarily know existed, we can bring to them, and market to them more efficiently.</p>
<p class="p p6">So there's opportunities there to drive up sell, to drive additional adoption. And so that's what we are focused on as far as how do we get people using it as much as possible, engage with it as much as possible, and then how do we monetize from that experience.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And how do you think about it just from your capacity perspective that fine pulling all those documents from these other stores into Dropbox? Does that count against my capacity and that doesn't add on its own, sort of just drive and users to hit their free tiers and in an up sell?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. So the more people are bringing documents in, the more people more they're storing with us. That's actually a good thing from a monetization perspective, because then they will cap out on storage capacity and shift over to paid plans. And again, we're being smart on the cost angle to that, right? And so that's where we already touched on our gross margins and our ability to navigate this increased engagement that we've seen and flex to what people are using. So all this increased usage that we've seen in recent times has been factored into our guidance.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Got it. Relative to the mobile world and so mobile I think hasn’t changed materially, the new Dropbox has been mostly focused on the desktop. What sort of opportunities are there on the mobile side to help to drive increased users? And how important is that from the top of the funnel perspective now versus where it was a couple of years ago?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">I think it is very important and something we're very focused on is, I think we all realize how much that we're on our phones and the opportunities that mobile presents. And so we are focused on bringing an experience that whether it's the new Dropbox that fits across your desktop, across the web, across the mobile device. And so that's something that we are highly focused on, capitalizing on these mobile channels is definitely something we've seen a lot of traction in and focus on. And, you see that in things like trials and how those have lifted and how conversion has gone there.</p>
<p class="p p6">And then just making the experience as easy as possible. And maybe one example I'll give that I use all the time, is when I'm asked to send a document to somebody. The scan functionality that Dropbox has, is something I use all the time. And I do that just from my phone. And if I had to sign something or if I want to send something to somebody, just take a quick picture of it with our scan functionality and send it off. And it's extremely easy.</p>
<p class="p p6">And I think these are opportunities that we're seeing as far as how are people engaging with our product and what channel are they engaging through, and then what does that mean as far as that we iterate on our product roadmap.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Got it. I want to turn back to the numbers, an area that I think Dropbox has been messaging is around shifting to ARR as opposed to trying to do kind of units in pricing. Can you help us understand? I think it is a pretty simple model in terms of seats and price. And so, the sort of drawbacks around that, why are you focusing people away from that? And are there any sort of significant changes that are precipitating that in terms of how maybe folks have looked at it in the past with using its in ARPU?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Sure. Yes, very good question. I definitely see ARPU or ARR as our key metric, that's how we drive our business. And we do not optimize for a given lever between paying users and ARPU, as because overly focusing on one or the other can be distortive. And maybe to give you a few examples, one of which and we've seen this in the past, is deal timing.</p>
<p class="p p7">So if we close a large outbound deal at the very end of a quarter, that can depress ARPU in that short-term moment. And so this is actually obviously a great thing for the company to close these larger deals. And so this is accretive to ARR, but it does put pressure on ARPU. And so this is where we are focusing on ARR.</p>
<p class="p p7">And again, EDU is another example, where over time it's something that is accretive to ARR and helpful to our long-term strategy, but in the short-term can depress ARPU. And maybe one last example is a family plan. So we just introduced this last quarter, so you could have a family signing up for six users at a given price.</p>
<p class="p p7">So that's going to have an interesting dynamic across paying users versus the actual price they're paying. And so this is we're only focusing on one of those levers versus just total ARR. You can lose track of what's really driving the business forward, and that's why I primarily focus on ARR.</p>
<p class="p p7">Now that all said, paying user growth has been the leading contributor to revenue growth and we expect that trend to continue. And ARPU is certainly an important lever, as we bring users to our team products and premium SKUs. So we do find value in both paying users and ARPU and we'll continue to disclose both metrics.</p>
<p class="p p7">But I primarily focus on ARR, I think our management team and our board does as well. And then, of course, we dig in and try to understand the levers underneath it. But this is why we don't primarily focus on, call it the subset levers.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And how do you think about with HelloSign, you brought in something that was kind of a standalone functionality into the platform? How do you think about sort of consolidating and Dropbox's role as a consolidator, bringing in other sort of productivity collaboration technologies into the platform? And what was it that enabled HelloSign to be looked at as something that made sense to be put on the platform?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. It's challenging to predict on the consolidation is a dynamic space with high valuations. But M&amp;A is certainly part of our strategy. And certainly seen COVID accelerate these team collaboration trends that were underway. And so big opportunity to solve customer challenges on productivity and collaboration.</p>
<p class="p p7">So, as we think about M&amp;A, we will assess our strengths. And so this is where HelloSign fit very well. They're focused on SMB, they're focused on self-serve, the ability to leverage and engage with our 600 million users.</p>
<p class="p p7">And I also think about what made a lot of sense on the HelloSign acquisition is the lifecycle of a signature where, if you think about the steps to get a signature you have to find your document, you have to send it out for signature, and then you store your document.</p>
<p class="p p7">And so, Dropbox can help with all of those steps. You find your document in Dropbox, send it for signature now through Dropbox, and you can store it through Dropbox. So that's something that makes complete sense from a synergy perspective, from a user experience perspective, and so we'll continue to look at opportunities that fit with that sort of construct.</p>
<p class="p p7">And so it's certainly potential for consolidation in this space, but also room for multiple players.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Got it. Yes. And as it relates to COVID, I'm curious what behavior you're seeing around customers who -- I mean, you have the new Dropbox, which enables you to consolidate content from other stores, differentiation versus what Google's outselling, and what Microsoft is outselling in this space? Have you seen any change in how COVID has shifted that landscape? And what sort of customers are utilizing Dropbox potentially more than some of those other offerings?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">I don't think we've seen dramatic changes from that standpoint. Most of our incoming users continue to be a mix of teams and individuals. Most of our users still use us for work. And I think COVID what has potentially changed from it, this blend of work in home, and just how people are truly having this integrated experience and how we can shift our strategy to focus on that. I've touched on the EDU vertical, so that's another one we've seen have some momentum behind it.</p>
<p class="p p8">But overall, I'd say again the top of the funnel has remained strong, trials are up, conversion has been steady and churn has been stable. So I wouldn't say dramatic changes other than the engagement and the utility of our product, just as we're dealing with this asynchronous work experience. And then certain opportunities that are just no longer available as far as again pen and paper is just not easy to do from an e-signature perspective right now.</p>
<p class="p p8">So a lot of the trends I've touched on already I think is what we've been seeing.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Got it. And around productivity or I guess return from this sort of direct sales type of sales motion. I know you've had -- it's not your primary vehicle for driving new paid customers and so forth. But could you contrast the sort of return that you get from the direct sales type activities versus the online customer acquisition, the free to paid and so forth? And is this an area that we should expect you to invest more over the coming quarters?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, great question. I think on the outbound side, that's where we have seen travel introduce some friction to the process. And this is part of the macro-economic uncertainty that we're all facing these days. Just not as easy to jump on a plane and go talk to a customer and close a potential deal.</p>
<p class="p p8">To your point, though, this is a small percentage of our revenue. 90% of our revenue is still self-serve and 10% thereby being outbound. So no plans to change that mix, it's a strategy that's worked very well for us is proven to be highly efficient. And I will say we're fortunate to have a product that's needed right now. And so that's where we can engage with those we know we can help EDU again a great example.</p>
<p class="p p8">And so we'll still continue to leverage our self-serve motion, just where we see pockets of Dropbox usage in a given company that gives us a signal on where we can target our outbound teams. And so we'll continue to leverage that. It's proven to be very effective, and we will stick with what's working there.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Got it. Actually I'm getting quite a few last couple of those have come in from the email questions here. And I'm getting a couple more. One, I think just kind of almost summarizing and asking a follow-up to what I've already asked to you. You've mentioned engagements up a decent amount, you've mentioned trials are up a decent amount, and the conversions are holding as they had in historical rates.</p>
<p class="p p8">I think the question is what is the disconnect between revenue not accelerating more? Is there something in the business where there's an offset to some of these factors that you've identified that are clearly positive factors?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. No, that's a fair and great question. Part of the revenue guidance deceleration is just the lapping of our Plus repricing. So we increased prices in the last year or so on the Plus program. And that expired at the end of last quarter, so that's putting pressure on the back-half of our year.</p>
<p class="p p8">But as far as what else we may be seeing, when I'd say is the -- we were seeing a higher portion of our call it COVID cohort, join as monthly subscribers, right? So more of them are coming in a -- still the majority of our subscribers are on an annual plan, but a greater portion of these new subscribers are coming in as monthly subscribers. And so that's where we're monitoring, okay, what does that mean for churn just given that they have more opportunities to churn throughout the year.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9">So, we're doing of course, everything we can to keep them and introduce them to everything we can solve for them. But it's just harder for us to predict what does it mean that they came in on a monthly plan, was that just a temporary. Then thinking COVID was only going to be a few weeks and months, or now that this has continued to extend, is that give us this greater window to retain them. So that's one angle with monitoring.</p>
<p class="p p9">Also, I will say that this initial surge in demand was largely constrained to the second quarter. So in March and April, we saw a large uptick as we were all told to go work-from-home. We'll see you. Come back, when we tell you it's safe. And so we saw this large uptick in March and April and that did taper off throughout the quarter, right? We've got situated and set up on Dropbox, and so that was largely constrain to the second quarter.</p>
<p class="p p9">And then, we also are looking at supporting our customers that are having financial challenges. So fair amount of our customers are SMB based. And so we're working with them to retain them as long as we can and to prevent churn. And so we're offering things like extended payment terms and changing invoicing frequencies and those sorts of things as tools to keep them with us. And so these are items that can put some pressure on billings and things like that. But those are potential offsets that we are actively monitoring and doing everything we can to come back, if you will.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Got it. No, that was actually really thorough helpful. Thanks for that. I think last one I wanted to ask you was around the long-term plan with gross margins and operating margins. And can you help and I think it was very clearly laid out. I think one thing that wasn't clearly laid out along that was this sort of revenue growth that would go with those margins. Can you help us understand just how you're sort of determining kind of the gross margin balance for your business? And you've made excellent strides in the last 12 months, as you highlighted, we have 20% operating margins.</p>
<p class="p p9">How do you think about that right tradeoff of growth and margin? And is there an opportunity to spend? Is there a situation where it would make sense to spend a little bit more than you've talked about relative to the implied margin because of the environment we're now in and potentially capitalizing more on the growth side?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. Great question. I will say that what we're trying to do is deliver consistent results, investing for double digit revenue growth and annual improvements in operating margin, with free cash flow rising to a billion annually. And then that that gives us capital to allocate leftover after all that.</p>
<p class="p p9">So, taking a step back, we have these long-term targets, 28% to 30% operating margins by 2024, billion in free cash flow by 2024. And so if you'd ask me, what is your main goal as CFO, I think it's hitting those targets. And that's really where I was involved in setting that course. And now that's my main focus on executing against those.</p>
<p class="p p9">And so, right now, it also does mean we're investing to drive double digit revenue growth and balancing growth and profitability along that path. And everything you've seen so far this year demonstrates our ability to execute on the operating margin side 20.5% in the second quarter, $120 million in free cash flow in the second quarter targeting $470 million free cash flow this year. So strong execution against what we -- the path we said we would do.</p>
<p class="p p9">And then I think maybe more to your question on growth, this is where I'm really going to be working with the management team, to make sure that we are targeting initiatives with the right level of ROI, and monitoring our new products and the new engagement with our new products to make sure that we're seeing the right momentum. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10">And those that are doing really well as we're seeing with the e-signature, as we're seeing in certain other pockets, okay, let's invest there and continue to drive that momentum. Those that may be missing the certain whether it's our initial hypothesis or sort of milestones. Let's consider shifting resources in a different direction.</p>
<p class="p p10">And so, I think part of it is the prudence and discipline we plan to bring to driving our business forward, where we definitely plan on seeing what's working, what's not working and driving towards that. And as far as potentially what are those opportunities to drive revenue growth, I continue to see significant opportunity in this work-from-home space, opportunity and conversion from basic users into individuals and into teams, opportunities that we're seeing in the smart workspace.</p>
<p class="p p10">So, I think there's significant challenges we're trying to solve across our customer base and significant opportunity to drive this growth. And it's up to us and the management team to monitor what's working and invest in that direction.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Got it. About out of time, just had one other question that came in. One thing we've seen with a number of companies and I think you've talked about it a little bit though, maybe not as much as is lower OpEx, just because of the environment we're in. And you mentioned at the onset of the session.</p>
<p class="p p10">How would you encourage investors as they sort of -- we're in September now they're starting to look into next year and so forth? How should investors look at their performance especially on the OpEx side during this year? And sort of tease out what has been that impact? I mean understanding there is not only savings that have come, but there's also areas that you as a company have had to invest maybe incrementally because of the work-from-home scenario. But how should investors think about that as we look at into next year where that normalizes potentially?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Tim Regan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes. Well, I like to think about it as we're on our way towards the 28% to 30% operating margins. And we've maybe taken a instead of a step and a half forward, maybe two steps forward this year. And so now, I see the momentum continuing. And I think one maybe to give you a specific example, opportunity that we're clearly seeing right now is the vast majority of our employees are currently based in high cost locations. So the vast majority of our employees are based in San Francisco, Seattle, New York, and Europe. They're in London and in Paris. And we're finding that we're quite productive, working wherever they are right now. We know where they are right now. And they are quite productive. And we're very efficient.</p>
<p class="p p10">So is there an opportunity for us to expand as far as our low cost locations? And how is that going to impact our margins? And these are sort of the things that I'm going to be working with management team and my team on to figure out not just where does it normalize, but how do we continue to drive. Let's hit those long-term targets and then figure out where do we go.</p>
<p class="p p10">And I think we're on the path to get there and we will continue to stay efficient in our approach.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Okay, great. Well, I think Tim, thanks a lot for the time. I appreciate your participation in the conference during this week. We'll sign off here, but appreciate very much your time.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Tim Regan</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Thanks, Walter. I appreciate it.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Walter Pritchard</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">All right. We'll talk to you a bit later.</p></div>
