<p class="p p1"><strong>Atif Malik</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Okay. We can get started. Welcome to day one of Citi Virtual Technology Conference. My name is Atif Malik. I cover U.S. semiconductor and equipment stocks here at Citi. With us today are Dan Durn, CFO Applied Materials; and Michael Sullivan, VP, Investor Relations.</p>
<p class="p p1">The format of our discussion is a fireside chat. Dan is going to open with a few comments and I’ll go with my questions first. If you have any questions for the AMAT management team, please email them to me. That’s atif.malik@citi.com.</p>
<p class="p p1">Over to you, Dan.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Dan Durn</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thanks, Atif, and good morning to everyone. So very quickly, just taking a step back, a lot going on with respect to pandemic, geopolitical environment, but this has been an incredible year with respect to semiconductors and semiconductor capital equipment. Demand remains strong with our customers. The strength is broad based.</p>
<p class="p p1">We’re seeing strength in our business across all device types. And this is one of the best years on record for our industry and we think that next year has the opportunity to be as good if not better than what we’re seeing this year. So we feel really good about how the overall markets performing in a difficult environment. </p>
<p class="p p1">From a company-specific performance standpoint, our company’s performing extremely well. We significantly outgrew the market and our peers in 2019. We see that same setup of significant outperformance in 2020. In fact, our business in the first half of the year is significantly outperforming both end markets and our competitors. We see each of our reporting segments being back half weighted, second half versus first half in calendar 2020. And again, we see that strength continuing into next year.</p>
<p class="p p1">Our performance [indiscernible], you saw 8 points of market share gain in our PVD, CVD and EPI business in 2019. We talked about having the fastest-growing etch business this year and our inspection business – process control and inspection business is growing at over 40%. So the strength we’re seeing is across multiple device types and it’s across multiple elements of our business.</p>
<p class="p p1">I guess the last thing I’d say is I want to give a big shout out to both our employees and our suppliers. I’ve been driving the COVID response at Applied Materials when we set up our team back in January to deal with the current environment, and I just could not be more proud and impressed by what our employees have accomplished in a difficult environment.</p>
<p class="p p1">We’re back to pre-COVID levels of output. Supply chain is responding very, very well and I like the way this company is set up against the backdrop of the market and as we look into 2021. So I just wanted to express that appreciation for a job well done by the company and employees.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Atif Malik</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you, Dan. Dan, Gary showed an interesting slide at SEMICON West in July where the semiconductor sales are expected to grow 2x. The rate that we have seen in the last 20 years, in the next 10 years is expected to grow 2x. What does that mean for wafer fab equipment spending over time? And the question I get asked quite frequently is like, what is the new baseline for wafer fab equipment investments?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Dan Durn</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Sure. Thanks, Atif. The setup behind that slide was a recognition by third-party research and I think there was two separate firms that said the overall semiconductor industry is going to hit $1 trillion and it’s going to do it by 2030. And so what Gary was showing was with $1 trillion semiconductor industry and what was a four-decade long ratio of the size of our industry, the overall semi industry, it’s about 11.5% plus or minus.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">And what you clearly see on that slide, as the industry grows to $1 trillion, our industry is going to be $100 billion plus. And so while today we’re in the mid to high-50s, we haven’t called next year. Does next year, is it 60 billion and maybe a little more? We haven’t come out with our official estimate yet. But we think the follow through into next year is good. So that puts you very close to maybe 120 billion over a two-year period.</p>
<p class="p p2">And I wouldn’t say 60 is a new normal for our industry. I think it’s a stepping stone on the way to a structurally larger industry in support of overall semiconductor growth. And we’ve been saying for a while that the growth trajectory on the industry will still have a cyclical overlay, but what we’ll see is higher highs and higher lows on our way to structural growth. And the amplitude of that cyclical overlay will become more compressed as a percentage over time.</p>
<p class="p p2">And so we feel really good about the growth setup of the industry and we feel particularly good about our position relative to the overall growth of the industry. Today, we’re about a 20% market share company. We would expect that to grow as the industry goes larger given what we see happening with our customers’ roadmaps and the proof points are playing out. We see the prove points in 2019. We see the proof points in 2020. And I think we’ll see those same prove points again playing out in 2021. So we like our position against that industry growth profile.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Atif Malik</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Great. Dan, if I can just dive into different end markets within the wafer fab equipment and starting with memory, can you reconcile elevated inventory software demand expected in the memory market in back half this year versus the outlook that you provided on your last earnings call, which I thought was far more realistic than some of the peers where you’re expecting no major spike in memory investments in second half given the weaker price environment?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Dan Durn</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Sure. So what we see in the memory market, first of all from a company-specific standpoint, in the first half of the calendar year, our memory business is up 17% and our closest peers are up 3% each. So clearly we’re showing signs of strength relative to the overall market and relative to the competition. And you’ve pointed out, we’re not calling for a big spike in the back half of the year, we’re not calling for a precipitous fall off. We see foundry-logic being greater than 55% of the spend this year, but we do see the memory market stronger this year versus last year.</p>
<p class="p p2">What we see customers doing is investing in technology roadmaps. We’re not seeing capacity additions come into the industry. We do see the efficiency bit production coming from that spend. We see that efficiency better than we did in 2017 and 2018 when a new architecture was introduced and so by definition the bit production was inefficient. We see that efficiency coming back into the market. Customers are dialing in bit supply with true end market bit demand trying to maintain health and balance in those end markets.</p>
<p class="p p2">And as we profile into next year, while we haven’t called for an overall size of the WFE market, we see the set up around that market being very similar. Foundry-logic being more than 55% of the spend next year and continued progress from a memory standpoint progressing down the roadmaps and putting additional capacity in place to make sure that there’s a disciplined additional capacity in bit supply to meet bit demand. So we’re not calling for anything dramatic to the upside, nothing dramatic for the downside and our business performance against that opportunity has been really, really strong. We feel good about our position.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Atif Malik</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Great. Dan, just on that point on the foundry-logic staying at 55% of the mix again, I thought your view was a bit different than your peers in expecting this part of the market to be stable in second half and even growing into next year. What’s some of the drivers to explain the higher foundry-logic investments?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Dan Durn</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, so our perspective is shaped by a couple of things. First, from a customer footprint standpoint, we’ve got a broader portfolio than any one in our industry which gives us a lot more of insight that we think is an advantage. We’ve got a number one position in foundry-logic. We’ve got a number one position in DRAM. We’ve got a number one position in packaging. Good number two position in NAND, but that position is growing. So our position is without question stronger than anyone else in the industry seeing the breadth of the market.</p>
<p class="p p3">So that gives us a level of insight based on what we’re hearing from our customers, so we feel good about that. The continued strength of foundry-logic is what we’ve been talking about now for several years. The data economy is playing out. Things like artificial intelligence and pushing intelligence to the edge as part of IoT is a really important trend. It’s being driven by the largest companies, exposed to the largest industries and what I call non-discretionary spend.</p>
<p class="p p3">There is a handoff between a consumer-oriented device being the predominant driver of semiconductors and we’re watching that handoff take place real time so the largest companies driving greater understanding of insight in their own business and their supply chain and the agility of their business and better insights of how to service their customer and asset utilization, physical asset utilization around the globe.</p>
<p class="p p3">What these companies are tapping into is an enormously deep economic pool that will make things like consumer device cell phones pale in comparison. So that is going to be a strong driver of compute power. The demand for compute power has never been greater than this today. Five years from now it’s going to be significantly greater than it is today. And a decade from now, it’s going to be tremendously greater than it is today.</p>
<p class="p p3">So it is nothing more than the recognition that these trends we’ve been talking about for a while are playing out as expected. Every day that goes by, our confidence interval around these trends go up, not down and I would say they’re stronger today than they were nine months ago pre-COVID. The trends towards localization of supply chain in intelligence and automation of those supply chains is just another driver and it’s again going to be non-discretionary spend. So it’s playing out as we expected. We like how we’re positioned.</p>
<p class="p p3">The only thing I would say is as the roadmap changes from 2D shrinks to what we call the new playbook, new architectures in these structures on vertical and the chip, new types of materials, new types of packaging, all of that is material engineering related and no company is better positioned – as that roadmap plays out, no company is better positioned than Applied Materials to be that key enabler of the power performance roadmap for our customers.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Atif Malik</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Great. Dan, moving onto China which is 15% to 18% of wafer fab equipment in our WFE model, you and your peers have talked about 9 billion to 10 billion of domestic investments this year. You and other equipment suppliers have been able to ship to China despite the mid-May Department of Commerce regulations. So can you just talk about this market, how do you see it, the China piece?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Dan Durn</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So if we take a look at the China market, I’ll go back to what we’ve been saying for a while, we see a slow, steady development of the ecosystem. We see spend this year being about 9.5 billion. Spend last year was about 6.5 billion give or take, so it’s roughly a 50% increase. But if you look at that 3 billion of incremental spend, it’s going to technology roadmaps, it’s going to 200 millimeter investments, 300 millimeter investments. And within 300 millimeter investments you’re seeing foundry-logic, NAND and DRAM. So it’s a very broad base of spend.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">And if you think about the global supply of semiconductors, you’ve got very large installed bases around the three device types; foundry-logic, NAND, DRAM. And while 3 billion of incremental spend on the surface seems like a lot, when you disaggregate it across its markets and you look at what cost to build a leading-edge foundry-logic fab $15 billion, $16 billion for just the factory floor equipment, that’s not including the cleanroom shell, it’s not including the utilities and the infrastructures for that production and the equivalent for a memory factor is $8 billion plus.</p>
<p class="p p4">And so the incremental capacity that comes online relative to that spend is still very, very small. And so it’s slow steady development of the ecosystem and all things being equal, we see China continuing down a slow, steady, disciplined build of an ecosystem that they hope stands the test of time and forms the foundation of an industry.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Atif Malik</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Great. Dan, moving onto the display side of your business, what are the puts and takes on the flattish guidance for next year? Historically we had seen a wave of high display spending after two to three years of a slower spend period. When should you expect that kind of investments in the display market?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Dan Durn</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Sure. So here’s the setup on display. 2018 we saw concurrent strong investments in both TVs and handsets. The overall market size was $18 billion plus and the company performed really very against that environment. Then what we saw is an outer phase investment cycle in '19. We see it again in '20. We’ll see it again in 2021.</p>
<p class="p p4">We think 2021 looks and feels a lot like 2020 in terms of both aggregate size and split between TVs and handsets. And it’s a digestion period from a very robust market in '17 and '18, but it’s also reflective of the fact that consumers have been impacted to some extent from government containment actions of the pandemic. We think the setup going into 2022 is for concurrent strong investment cycles again. And so we would expect to go from a cyclical bottom to a cyclical strength in 2022.</p>
<p class="p p4">And then as I look at the roadmap going forward, every day that goes by you’re seeing more and more talked about OLED coming to TV and you’re seeing more about flexible and foldable displays coming to the handset. What I like about each of those technologies is, is they’re more capital intensive than the current generation of technologies.</p>
<p class="p p4">And while 18 billion plus is sort of the cyclical high point of the current generation of technologies, I think you’ve got an opportunity as those roadmaps play out to go into the mid-20s from a structural size standpoint. And we like how our company is positioned against those opportunities in the portfolio of technologies we have. So while we’re bumping along the cyclical bottom today, we expect this to become a tailwind for us here in the near future.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Atif Malik</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Great. And then the services business, a big reason why investors are looking at these talks differently because it’s become one-third of you sales, so a fully stable baseline. How much of this business is fixed annuity type sales versus variable? And can this be a double-digit grower versus your SSG business?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Dan Durn</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. So this is a great business for us. And like you pointed out, the installed base business, it’s about a third of our revenues. It’s the AGS reporting segment plus our 300 millimeter upgrades. And so when we look at the business, all of it is recurring in nature given the fact that it’s built on top of our industry leading installed base. So largest installed base in the industry. Upgrades are about taking capabilities of that installed fleet and bringing recurrent to today’s more capable technologies and that’s a really good business for us. The spares and service part of the business, that’s what we see reported in the AGS segment.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">And when we break that apart, there’s a transactional component and then there’s the long-term service agreement. 60% of our spares and service revenue today is long-term service agreement like, so that’s more subscription like and very predictable in nature and the company’s done a good job. A handful of years ago it used to be 30% of spares and service for long-term service agreements. We grew that penetration to 40% and then 50% and now we’re at 60% and we’re going to continue to grow that penetration.</p>
<p class="p p5">And our customers are happy taking the journey because they see better performance from tools that are under longer-term service agreements. The transactional spares and service, the part that’s not under long-term service agreement, is leveraged to industry utilization. Industry utilization is pretty robust. We’ve talked about the data economy, the need for data, storage, compute power. Industry utilizations are good. And so any time you’re monetizing an installed footprint, it has a recurring nature. So we feel good about how that business is positioned.</p>
<p class="p p5">And then taking a step back from how we operate the business and just taking a look at the journey over time, this is a business that in 2013 I think was $2 billion. We’ve doubled the size of that business in the last half a dozen years; new management team, new strategy. Gary put focus on it. We knew it was a great business. And it was an untapped diamond for us. And so we've done a much better job running that business, driving the strategy, management team has done a great job executing against it.</p>
<p class="p p5">We've doubled the size of that business. I think it's grown at a compound rate of 12% over that time period. So we feel really good about the execution against the opportunity. We'll come out with a revised model as soon as we close the Kokusai transaction, talk about how that business grows longer term, but we expect to be able to grow the services business faster than we do our installed base given the strategy we're executing against and the way our customers are responding.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Atif Malik</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Good. Dan, just moving back with the silicon business, Gary talked about growing this business faster than wafer fab equipment from next year and even highlighted new etch and process control products. What are some of the key products or end markets you're looking at to outgrow the wafer fab equipment market?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Dan Durn</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. So if we take a snapshot of where we are today in time, we talked about significantly outperforming the market and our peers in 2019. We’re significantly outperforming and again in 2020. We would expect that to continue in 2021. We've talked about CVD, PVD, EPI growing 8 points of share in 2019. Gary spent a lot of time on the most recent call talking about the fastest growing etch business, number one conductor etch in the DRAM market, inspection and process control growing greater than 40%. The product cycles in those businesses, it's broad based, it's more than just etch and inspection. Those are an important part of the story.</p>
<p class="p p5">But the outperformance today is more broad based than that. And again, if you look at our memory business in the first half of calendar '20 versus first half of calendar '19, our business is up 17% versus the competition that are at 3% each. Foundry business; we’ve got the fastest growing foundry business in the industry. And what it comes down to is how we're positioned from a key enabling technology standpoint. We talked about the power performance roadmap being driven by a number of elements, not just 2D shrinks anymore. A number of elements are driving that.</p>
<p class="p p5">And our position at 5 nanometers is much greater than it was at 7. Our position at 3 is going to be much greater than 5. The number of applications that we're opening up and the way we're positioned against those opportunities, you can see node over node momentum. We see the same thing in DRAM and that's playing out very, very strongly in the current environment. We would expect that to continue. When we take a look at – and NAND we're making good progress. And we like the momentum that we see there from a technology standpoint.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">When you take a look at etch, we've got a traditional source of strength in the staircase. In NAND, you see that in patterning – playing out in patterning in DRAM. We're moving that position to foundry-logic now and you see us opening up applications with that momentum. We really like the way that story is playing out and building on a source of strength we had in NAND moving into DRAM and now moving into foundry-logic, and we'll see that play out here in the next several years. So it comes down to just a number of the elements that we've been talking about coming together.</p>
<p class="p p6">The strength we see in the end markets continuing, semis are going larger, semiconductor capital equipment is going larger, the power performance roadmap is changing. Nobody is better positioned against that new roadmap than we are as a company. And you see significant outperformance in linking. You see significant outperformance in the first half of '20. You're going to see significant outperformance for the full year calendar 2020. You see that follow through going into 2021. And as these trends play out, we would expect to continue to make progress given the technology portfolio and what we see on the opportunities increasing node over node in a lot of different markets.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Atif Malik</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Great. And, Dan, on your target model, you're exiting this year close to the $5 run rate or in line with your fiscal '20 financial target model, and that is with the display at a cyclical bottom. What are the knobs with respect to OpEx and gross margins that you can control to improve future earnings power?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Dan Durn</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. Thanks, Atif. So let me start by saying as soon as we close Kokusai, we’ll hold an Analyst Day. We’ll recalibrate what the long-term model looks like. So that's on the horizon. That will happen here very, very shortly. You pointed out that we've got our semi systems business playing out as we expected. We see momentum from a revenue standpoint on node over node progression. AGS; great business, performing really, really well. It's now a third of the overall revenue composition. Display is at a cyclical bottom, which has created a near-term headwind for us. And you pointed out even with that near-term headwind, we're very close to the $5 run rate.</p>
<p class="p p6">When we see – when we talk about the $5, we see it as more of a stepping stone, not an end state. And so as our growth thesis plays out, not only in terms of overall market size, but how we're positioned in the foundry-logic business and how we're positioned in DRAM and how we're positioned in NAND and packaging, and we see the momentum playing out and we see our share having an upward bias off the 20% we see today, we see $5 as a milestone. It's a stepping stone on our way to something that's larger, structurally larger. We'll talk about that once we close the Kokusai transaction.</p>
<p class="p p6">From an OpEx standpoint and you know Gary's playbook, incredibly disciplined with discretionary spend. Almost 70% of what we spend in OpEx today is in R&amp;D, it's fuel for future growth. And we do see a once in a generation inflection in our industry. There is a handoff in the power performance roadmap and how it's being driven. It's going from 2D shrinks to a number of different vectors. And at the core of those, each of those vectors is materials engineering and we are better positioned against that opportunity than anybody else in this industry. So Gary will invest in those inflections to make sure this company is positioned to lead.</p>
<p class="p p6">We see the early steps of that playing out '19 and '20. You'll see the follow through in 2021. Those are based on investments that we made in '17 and '18 now playing out in market. We're going to continue to invest to lead, but you see a very disciplined approach. We invest where we've got an opportunity to lead and drive return value for shareholders.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">From a gross margin standpoint, we're bringing very interesting technology to market and we're going to be paid for that key enabling technology. What I would observe is, is you're also going to go from a cyclical bottom in display to a more robust spend environment, and display is below the corporate average. Services is going to continue to grow and grow nicely, but there's clear portfolio benefits from a strong growing services business but it's below the corporate average from a gross margin standpoint.</p>
<p class="p p7">So you'll have the competing tradeoffs between driving more innovation in our core semi business and being paid well for that offset by a growing display and service business. And so the best way I'll describe it today is, is we're a 45% gross margin business plus or minus a couple points depending on where we are in the cycle. And I think if you were to extract the COVID related headwinds that we see in the current environment, you'd see that model playing out quite nicely in the current environment.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p7"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Q - Atif Malik</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Great. Dan, I’m going to switch to some of the emails I'm getting from the audience. There's a question on Kokusai in terms of what are the expectations, current expectations for the deal to close?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Durn</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. So we feel good about it. We're making progress. As you know from a regulatory standpoint, five, six have been achieved. Last one remaining is China. Conversations continue to be constructive. So we're very encouraged by that. We'll just continue to engage and make progress. And we're optimistic that we'll have a positive outcome. So we’ll just keep engaging constructively and continue to be optimistic by what we see and the nature of the conversations.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Atif Malik</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">The next one and I’ll [indiscernible] the customer names. If the microprocessor company goes in fab light or fabless and tries to use the Taiwan foundry, what does your share look like between those two customers?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Durn</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. And so here's what I would say. And I want to be careful because I’m going to be very respectful to all customers. As I take a look at the overall size of our end markets, I think the overall size, it's more deterministic how many wafers get produced at the leading edge as opposed to which customer produces them. So I think that fundamental decision logic versus foundry isn't going to have a big influence on overall market size.</p>
<p class="p p7">As they take a look at how we're positioned node over node from a technology standpoint, our leading logic customers and leading foundry customers, I'll tie back to what I've been saying, I think pretty strongly throughout the call we're really well positioned node over node in both our leading logic and leading foundry customers. We understand the portfolio of innovation that we're bringing to market and the importance of that innovation to our customers’ roadmaps. And so we feel good node over node momentum on both of those submarkets.</p>
<p class="p p7">Then what I would tie back to I guess the third of the three elements is we report revenues today in a combined segment called foundry-logic. But if you were to go back in time, you would observe that we used to break that out. And what you would have observed back in time is our foundry share is greater than the foundry-logic segment and the logic share is below foundry-logic segment. So if you go back in time, you'd observe a dynamic and pattern around our company with respect to the two submarkets that today comprise foundry-logic and I think that gives you some insight from a market share standpoint how something like that would play out over time.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Atif Malik</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Great. Then there's a question on how do you view the deposition market trends in light of EUV migration?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Durn</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So what I would observe first from a very high level is 5 nanometers is the first real substantive node where EUV is playing a role in size and scale. And as EUV is cut in at 5 nanometers, what you notice and recognize about our foundry-logic business is, is it's posting record revenue. And so we see that technology inflection being good for a company like Applied.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">We've actually been saying that now for quite some time and we're seeing the prove points in the market. We're actually posting record foundry-logic revenue. As that technology cuts in, you see it in our opportunity to co-optimize things like dep and etch and create solutions for customers that allow that technology cut in, you see our etch opportunity increasing around key steps from an EUV standpoint. And you also see multi-patterning continue to be the robust footprint in our customers’ technology roadmaps.</p>
<p class="p p8">I'd also say and tie back to what I said earlier, our opportunity at 3 nanometers we see as greater than what we're currently seeing at 5. So we see node over node momentum around those critical key applications that helped make that technology successful. So it is still an element of our customers’ roadmaps, but you can see the broader industry ecosystem also pursuing things like used case specific architectures.</p>
<p class="p p8">Architectures are broadening. You're seeing more vertical type structures in the different markets and you'll see more of that over time in end markets. You're seeing new types of materials being introduced. Anytime there is a technology inflection, it's going to be good for our company. EUV is one of those technology inflections and we're posting record revenues right alongside that technology coming in, and we look forward to continuing to perform well in the future.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Atif Malik</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay. And the next one on a similar topic. Silicon shrinks getting more expensive need to move to new materials in the future. Do potential future materials innovations come more from the equipment suppliers or from manufacturers or industry groups?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Durn</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, so there's always going to be a partnership but those new types of materials, we're going to play a very, very, very key role in the art of the possible. Gary spends all his time with people down into the R&amp;D organizations. And we understand several nodes out what our customers are trying to do and the types of solutions they're going to need to deliver. We talked about Selective Tungsten being a really important aspect. When you've got a contact that is a certain size and the old way of building that would be to put a liner in the hole and then fill it with tungsten. As the size of that hole node over node shrinks, the proportion of the size being consumed by the liner, the percentage of that goes up dramatically leaving less and less for the fill of the actual wire.</p>
<p class="p p8">With Selective Tungsten not needing the liner and building up the tungsten means that all of that opening, all of that hole, all of the size of that pipe is now active conductor just creates a tremendous opportunity for us over time. So understanding the customers' roadmaps and then delivering innovation to the industry that allows those roadmaps to play out, it's a super important mutually dependent ecosystem. They can't do it without our innovation, but we can't innovate in a vacuum. We've got to understand where they want to take their roadmaps and then be creative about how to accomplish that.</p>
<p class="p p8">The other thing I'd say is and this is more sometimes the industry doesn't know what it doesn't know. And so what we've done is, is we've acquired a really important skill set inside of the company, world-class technologists who understand where roadmaps want to go but the limitations that maybe customers have based on their level of visibility of the innovation we have in our pipeline. And so what we can do is we can bring key pockets of technology together from across the company and what we're calling integrated materials solutions and demonstrate to customers things that they didn't think were possible.</p>
<p class="p p8">And those solutions and the ability to bring those to market quickly to drive the power performance roadmap have the potential to very sticky solutions in the industry. So part of it is in concert with our customers but part of it is fundamental innovation to demonstrate things that they didn't think were capable from a power performance roadmap. And again, this is why I think we are – there's nobody better positioned in this industry to drive that roadmap going forward, the power performance roadmap. We think there's a really exciting time in front of us based on the capabilities we have and our ability to bring those together in a really meaningful way for our customers.</p>

<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Atif Malik</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Okay. And could you ask if there is gross margin expansion potential in the services business? Also, ASML is trying to shift to a performance output-driven pricing structure. Would this work for Applied Materials as well?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Durn</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. So I do think there's an opportunity to evolve the business model over time. I call it an area under the curve problem. There's a theoretical ramp, yield ramp, technology insertion yield ramp and then an entitlement yield. If the factory operated perfectly on that theoretical curve, that would be an enormous return on investment for customers. There are opportunities for performance enhancements for these contracts based on helping our customers’ time to ramp and entitlement yield profile. If we can influence the consistency and the time to achieve those outcomes, there's an opportunity for customers and us to share in that benefit. And so I do think there's opportunities.</p>
<p class="p p9">I'll never sign up for you can't improve gross margins. We will always work to improve them. The gross margin in our service business, it's a fundamental people business and so it's hard to create leverage in that model given where we sit today. Is there opportunity? Yes. Will we work on it? Yes. We'll always look to improve. But it is fundamentally a people-driven business and the gross margin, there's a limit to the scalability.</p>
<p class="p p9">Now, with the adoption of things like virtual reality and creating a new engagement model and remote hook up to tools, is there a way to create more leverage in that human-based model operating on a global footprint? There may be. We're looking at lots of different things in the new normal, the new normal environment that we're currently operating in to think about how we change that model, get better outcomes for the customer and leverage the infrastructure that we built around the globe in a more efficient and effective way. If we're successful in that journey, then there's an opportunity to improve the gross margin structure of that business.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Atif Malik</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Okay. How does the company look at managing risk with respect to certain chipmakers being added to vanity [ph] list? What are the current lead times?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Durn</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. So the best thing we can do as a company is focus on innovation of things we can control, focus on the customers, focus on the roadmaps, focus on the innovation, have a very flexible global footprint that allows us to respond to a variety of environments and be very critical to our customers’ success. As the circumstances change, try to be as agile as possible to respond to whatever the new rules and construct is and respond as quickly and as effectively as we can. That’s the best thing we can do as a company.</p>
<p class="p p9">What we can’t control are actions taken by government’s impact to certain pockets of the industry. All we can do is try to build the best business as possible, built on technology and innovation being the key enabler for our customers and then respond as quickly and as effectively as we can to a changing set of circumstances. I think that’s what all management teams really have in their control. That’s what we have in our control. That’s what we will continue to do to make sure that whatever environment that we wake up to, we’re able to optimize the position and results and value creation for our company in that environment.</p>
