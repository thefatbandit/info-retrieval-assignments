<p class="p p1"><strong>Conference Call Participants</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Karen Short - Barclays Capital</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">All right. Well, good afternoon everyone. My name is Karen Short, and I am the Staples and Hardline Retail Analyst to Barclays. We're very pleased to once again welcome Walmart to the Barclays Staples Conference. To state the obvious, with close to $550 billion in global sales, Walmart is the largest global retailer. This point cannot be emphasized enough, but equally important, the list of successful global brands is very short, and clearly, Walmart would be at the top of the list.</p>
<p class="p p1">And with us from Walmart, we are very pleased to welcome Britt Biggs, Walmart's Chief Financial Officer. As I think all of you know by now, the format will be fireside with no Q&amp;A this year. You should see Walmart's Safe Harbor slide on the screen momentarily. Please refer to this and their latest SEC filings for any forward-looking statements that are made this morning.</p>
<p class="p p1">On TikTok, I would just like to point out, and remind investors that Walmart is not elaborating on the topic beyond public statement the company made on August 27. So, if anyone is listening and thinks that I am not interested in asking about it, that's not the case. It's just we have 30 minutes and we want to get this covered as possible.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, this is obviously a very unique time for any essential retailer. Again, we thank you very much for your participation and insights. So, as the largest global retailer, you are obviously in a very unique position to get the pulse of the consumer. So, I wanted to start off a little bit on whether or not you have any comments to make in general on the state of the consumer, and then I do want to ask this in the context of [top line and] [ph] market share in the U.S., because this seems to be the biggest point of contention I guess as it relates to whether you are or not losing share, and then, I'll jump into some other questions.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes, you bet. Thanks for having me, looks a little different than last year, obviously this -- again to state the obvious. As we think about the consumer, so much has changed in the last six months, so many dynamics, it's tough to peel through everything that's going on. You’ve had such disruption end of our first quarter, start of the second quarter, but in the same way you had stimulus, a large stimulus particularly in the U.S., and so, understanding given our second quarter results, some of that was stimulus, some of that was people spending money on things. They are not spending as much on vacations, gasoline, and things like that, and so, they would spend more in place like Walmart. So, it's tough to peel all those things apart. The economic numbers over the last few weeks seem to look better than they have over the past. Again, it's hard to know how much of that is stimulus-related, and we will be watching like everybody else what happens in Washington in the next several weeks around stimulus, but it's been a very interesting five or six months certainly from a retail standpoint with certain retailers closed, certain ones like us open.</p>
<p class="p p1">When you look at the period of time overall, we feel really good about our business. We have gotten a lot of questions about market share. We know we have taken market share in certain categories, general merchandize, which is very good for us from a customer perspective as well as from a margin perspective. Grocery and consumer market shares are a little tougher for us to read as a lot of things have gone on, which has a lot of noise around the numbers. We significantly pulled back on our operating hours, which you know we started closing around 8:30 for most of the second quarter. Now, we have taken those operating hours back to 10 o'clock. We know that impacted us some in the second quarter not having those operating hours like we had them metering stores, things like that.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Price is still really important, but with the stimulus dollars that were in the market, convenience became even more important, we think, during in the quarter now. We have made a lot of inroads as far as convenience over the past several years and that benefited us, but I think people probably became a little less price sensitive maybe in the second quarter, and from an out-of-stock standpoint, we had some struggles as did a number retailers in that second quarter. We are in better shape than we were certainly a few months ago, and we are getting better every week, but there are certain categories that will take some time still to get back to where we want to be from an overall in-stock perspective.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">On that note, and I am probably going to have to jump to Walmart Plus fairly quickly, but on that note, in terms of the actual hour reduction and then in terms of the inventory, I think people may underestimate how much and how great the percent of sales are actually done at Walmart say from call 8:30 PM to 7:00 AM, and most to probably really understanding the basis point impact on your sales. So, maybe can you -- any color you could give on that?</p>
<p class="p p2">And then, on the inventory and the out-of-stocks, I mean as you said in one of the earlier meetings, you obviously have become unbelievably efficient with inventory and you probably basically just-in-time inventory, while you have all algorithms completely run out of whack. So, is there -- could you talk bit about that, and I guess the ability to override the algorithm that you have obviously been operating under for decades?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. On the operating hours, we haven't quantified it externally, but it was important enough that we mentioned it quite a bit in our second quarter release, and I know there are times even as a customer when it was 8:30 and I wanted to go to Walmart for few weeks that we weren't open past 8:30, and so, you really had to change your mindset a little bit as a customer. I think we've got customers back to now to where it feels a little more normal for customers.</p>
<p class="p p2">The other thing to mention too would be pricing, and our price gaps in number of categories actually widened in the second quarter, and so, when you -- number of our competitors weren't as promotional in the second quarter or actually raised prices, we really didn't, and that created some noise as well around on the market share side would be on the dollar basis. </p>
<p class="p p2">On the inventory, store managers do have some ability to override, but there is two kind of large buckets of inventory, one would be shortly timed that will be food and consumables, and we can make adjustments on that pretty quickly, but you've got to have supply down the chain with our suppliers to be able to do that as well, and that was a challenge for a little while and they are doing the best they can as well, and there's longer lead time. Think about holidays, Halloween, Thanksgiving, not Thanksgiving, Halloween and Christmas where we are going to have to make bets a little further out. It's tougher to change those. So, merchants have to make some assessments there. The store managers do have some ability, but our systems are such they can look at the demand by store and pretty quickly adapt to a shorter period of time. Now, the algorithms over the last few months, I'm not going to want to repeat those all the time, but they do learn pretty quickly.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay. So, jumping to Walmart Plus, because it seems to be the number one topic, maybe talk a little bit about -- so I actually wanted to take a slightly different angle than some of the things that you've asked in prior meetings. I frequently get the comment that Amazon didn't breakeven until it reached a certain number like -- whatever 100, I guess $100 billion in sales, and so, the comparison is that introducing this is going to only exponentially increase your losses. So, I want to maybe see, get your framework on that a little bit. I guess I would argue that the Walmart behavior as a shopper is just very different from how people shop Amazon, but is there a risk that you train the customers that are shopping Walmart like they shop Prime?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. I mean there's a number of things we considered as we looked at Walmart Plus. One, it's really important we think for us to offer this for customers, and our members in Walmart Plus. The world has evolved, customers evolved a lot over the last several years, and we've had a membership forever at Sam's Club, that people have gotten more used to using memberships, whether it's movies or streaming, or other things that they do, we felt like this was the right time to give customers that option. There's a number of things that we can do with this over time. So, we've announced three main benefits at this point, but there'll be other things that we do over time. It was important to get the membership at the right price point, where we thought would be good for our customers, which is under $100. So, feel good about that.</p>
<p class="p p3">Customers are going to -- they're going to shop however they want to shop, and we know that, and we've been setting ourselves up for that for several years. We still love customers coming on to our stores, and we think that's going to be a big part of what we do forever, and so having the opportunity to pickup in stores, making sure that the Supercenters in particular are a great place to shop. Those things are all going to continue to be important. Basket size matter, we think we will continue our basket size, we think basket size will get bigger, we've seen that in grocery pickup where basket size are bigger than they are in the stores, and so that part's very different than what some of our other competitors might have, and now the ability to get increasing mindshare with that customer on the grocery and consumable side, and then be able to get more of their general merchandise business, which is great for us from a mindshare perspective, market share perspective, as well as margin perspective, is a really important part of this.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So, when you think about the demographics that this would appeal to, obviously, the questions come up that, you know, and I've had this question asked, why would people -- why would a customer pay a fee when there's a minimum of $35? So, maybe can you just talk a little bit about the thought process behind that, but also just talk a little bit about why you think this is something that would appeal to all demographics, because I think the perception is that it's only a higher [technical difficulty]?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, we wanted to appeal broadly. I mean, Walmart's always been kind of democracy for shoppers. If you look at the U.S. population, we tend to mirror from an income level, racial/gender, we kind of mirror America, and that's what we like, and the same as we do in other countries. But getting that bigger basket, the baskets we're seeing with most of our customers for delivery or pickup, the $35 minimum wouldn't seem to have made that much of a difference, and it is a way for us to differentiate what we do from the way that we fulfill as well. So, it does help us from a fulfillment standpoint. We think we give the customer still what they want. So that's we think is a win-win, and just -- we want to do things that fit our customer base, and we don't think this appeals one way or another to lower income or higher income. We do think it is really broad reaching. That's what we like so much about it. We think we've got something in there for everybody, and the price point is really attractive.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And when you -- I guess, you obviously started testing this before you consolidated the apps, but is there anything you could talk to in terms of the behavior and attachment rate pre the consolidation of the apps from general merchandise perspective to currently, and then anything you could talk to in terms of what you're seeing on the behavior now that the consolidation of the apps [present] [ph]?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">We'll talk about it specifically from a competitive standpoint, but you can imagine, anything you can do to make it easier for that customer to go across the aisle, so to speak, and buy general merchandise the better, and that's why the Supercenter was such a great retail invention is because it brings people into the store for food and consumables, but then it has everything they need from the general merchandise side, and it mixes out in a way that makes sense. I don't think online is going to be that different actually, and as we continue to get people at the top of the funnel, with food and consumables and things like Walmart Plus will help us do that. We will become more top of mind on general merchandise, and we have really good strong general merchandising business, we can make it stronger. The second quarter was a great reminder to all of us of what that flywheel really looks like when it works, and so, what we've seen so far is we have made it easier for the customer to do that. There are things we'll continue to do that will make it even easier. I feel certain [indiscernible] things a year from now that where we've made that easier than it is today.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay, and then, you've commented a couple times on the gap in price. Our price checks at least in grocery definitely show widening of the gap. So, I guess the question is how do you think about when that gap will actually matter again? It just feels like consumers are [surplus] [ph] with cash, other things that they're not spending on, you know, and if you're not necessarily getting credit for it, when do you think you will, I guess?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, there are some things that are a bit counterintuitive right now.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">The price gap always matters, and the customer they notice that it's not as formulaic as we make it, but the customer notices it. It still matters for sure. If we don't get another stimulus package, which all of us are monitoring like you our price probably matters even more. We will get back to something at sometimes it feels a little more normal than this and price will matter. Convenience matters more than it used to, and I think that's here to stay. We've seen some trends accelerate over the last five months that are here to stay more people in e-commerce, probably more people eating at home things like that. Some of those works in I think are working to our benefit now, but the price gap is always going to matter, and we're going to be thoughtful about it. There are price -- we want to find that optimal point where we're doing what we need to for customers, but also ensuring that shareholders get the benefit that they should see as well.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So, on that cash topic, I don't know if you can answer this or not, but it seems that there may be a tax bill coming for many customers or many consumers who got the $600 stimulus weekly, meaning that there wasn't withholding taken out of that. I don't know if you've ever done any analysis on this at all, because it kind of -- I would venture to say if there is a tax bill and it will just be subject to regular tax withholding, there are going to be a lot of shocked consumers in March. Do you have a view on that?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Nothing to specifically discuss, I think there is so many things right now that are unusual or that could have impacts down the road, as you say first quarter, second quarter of next year, that will just continue to monitor how they all work together, and in aggregate to have an impact on the customer. I think we're just going to have to just to make our way through things like that [assuming it] [ph] becomes an issue.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Right, okay, and then when you think about the 2020 holiday season, may be talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that from a competitive perspective, because on one hand, I could argue that the consumer is going to do anything and everything they can to make it a special or possible because everyone is so bored.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Right.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">On the other hand, I could argue that, you have prime day combined with no real Black Friday, Black Friday, really? So how do you kind of think and weigh those two factors?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, our merchants, we've basically the only thing we've announced so far is we'll be closed on Thanksgiving Day, which is something new for us. Glad we're doing that, and then we'll announce more as we get closer to the holidays, Thanksgiving is still two and a half months away, which in today's world seems like a long time, but that our merchants have on some of the long lead time items we talked about a minute ago, they've made bets of where they think the holiday will come out. Holiday is going to look a lot different than prior years, as you said how promotions from competitors work out over that period of time, I think remains to be seen, but we feel good about how we're positioned for the holiday, I'm with you, I think people will want to make this special, and so I would expect things like I'm not the head merchant, but I expect things like trim a tree and other things like that people want to decorate their homes will probably be pretty big this year. We've seen that and other times when there has been a downturn in the economy that people really want to go out for the holidays, and they'll be some places where they'll be more conservative, and our merchants haven't been through something exactly like this, but we've had periods of time that it may either good or bad for the holidays. From an economic standpoint, they're pretty good at knowing how to work your way through that.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And then, maybe turning to eCom becoming less unprofitable I guess, I think people are trying to struggling a little bit with what to think is about in terms of what structural in nature in terms of more permanency or less unprofitable eCom business. Maybe can you kind of talk a little bit about the puts and takes and how we should all think about that going forward?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure. In really over the last, I'd say, 12 months even we've been talking about some positive things we were seeing on the profitability side from e-commerce and there're just several levers within there, one is sales growth obviously; two is increased, or the increased rate of fixed costs, then there's variable cost of fulfillment, there's contribution margin, those are four things that we watch really closely. A lot of tailwinds for the e-commerce business in the second quarter, but we're already seeing some of those things in the first quarter, which makes us feel good that structurally we're making progress. Obviously, when you almost double the size of your business in the quarter, that helps leverage expenses all the way down the line, but the work that we've done over the past several quarters on getting more brands online, particularly in home and apparel and in higher margin categories, it helps a lot with contribution margin, which is you grow sales and that actually just starts leveraging your fixed costs at a pretty rapid rate, and so that we were seeing that already last couple of quarters, but it certainly showed up in the second quarter. So, it's those kinds of things that structurally I feel good about where we're going that won't -- maybe I'll look as good as the second quarter did, but it was a demonstration to us that the way we're thinking about that e-commerce model is right, and we saw what that looked like in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay, and maybe on that, can you just elaborate a little bit in terms of what capital, if any, would be required going forward with respect to Walmart Plus fulfillment centers in general, and also maybe an update on how many SKUs you have on Walmart Plus and eCom, and whether or not those are all actually mirrored at all your FCs, because I think that was one of the tipping points at pre-COVID for you?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, we've made a lot of progress on mirroring. We have about 160,000 items that would be next day eligible on -- I mean, same day eligible on delivery, and a little more than that on next day. So, mirroring has come a long way over the last year. We haven't updated. We'd say 200,000 Plus, we haven't really updated that number in a little while, and probably won't from a competitive standpoint, but that we feel good about the ability to get the customer what they want, when they need it. As we've talked about what capital could look like over the next couple of years, we've been kind of in this $10 billion to $12 billion range for a period of time, and I think most years that's probably about right, and there's some assumption there about increasing fulfillment capacity. Now what we've seen in the first and second quarter, we can really get the e-commerce business ramped up to where we wanted to, maybe we add capacity faster than we had anticipated, maybe a year or two the number goes up, but overall, I feel good about our ability to add capacity at a rate that makes sense from a financial standpoint.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And with respect to the FCs that you have now, those all have the capability to fairly meaningfully broaden the marketplace use, correct, without incremental fact that [indiscernible] increasing its actual past year size of the facilities, that's my understanding there.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, that'd be accurate. I mean, as we continue, we had triple-digit growth in marketplace in the second quarter, and we're also trying to ramp up Walmart fulfillment services, which would be taking third parties and running at their own fulfillment, but to the extent that grows dramatically that'll be a good thing for us from a top of mind standpoint as well as profitability when you get 3P in marketplace going more rapidly. So, if that continues to grow like that, we'd be just fine adding fulfillments phase, we'd be glad to do that.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay, and then, I guess in terms of overall margin structure, I mean, I think it's obviously known and documented with every investor that we should always kind of expect U.S. gross margins to be down, and that's certainly what you get credit for. How do you think about that though going into the second-half just again given that your price gaps are so wide, and you're not really getting credit for it at the moment, maybe a little color on how to think about that?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, we got a little bit of a shift in the second quarter, with gross margins going up, and a lot of that was mixed as I talked about. Yes, I think I've said to you before, even Karen that we need to be able for gross margins to go down over time, to some degree markets, and customers will determine where that margin rate goes, and that's why I've been so focused on expenses, is being able to get our expense and cost structure in a point to where gross margins could come down some over time and our operating profit margin maintain where we're at, or even potentially go up a little bit. That model works, because we do that and grow the top line, you get that, you've seen we can do it 3% and 4% growth, just such big dollars that it leverages dollars, even if the rate stays the same, the dollars grow pretty dramatically. Could margins go up? If we -- our general merchandise, I mean, if our general merchandise business performs like we hope it can over the next two or three years, there's room for that to happen, but that also would give us the opportunity to invest back in some other things that would help the business longer term. So, there's a lot of optionality, I think we create with the focus, we've had in expense leverage and it's still there and that optionality is important.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And maybe with respect to expenses, I guess can you just remind us how we should be thinking about COVID-related expenses into the third quarter or back-half, and then how are you thinking about wages obviously in line with Target's announcement and just broader wage pressure?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. So, on COVID-related expenses, we had a $1.5 billion roughly in the second quarter, and about three quarters of that were related to pay and benefits. So, we had two special bonuses that were in that number, and then also some things we've done around sick pay and time-off for people who either are concerned about COVID or have COVID emergency leave time. So, there'll be some expenses that continue I think probably for quite a while, things around sanitation, maintenance, anything we need to do for customer and associate safety, we'll continue to do that. So, there's some level that that's going to continue probably for a period of time, but not the level you've seen it at Q1 and Q2.</p>
<p class="p p7">On the wage front, we're just always watching it. We have to be able to recruit good talent, we have to be able to retain people, we really have to look at it geography by geography, I don't think looking at a rate across the nation's percent I don't think is the right way to look at it, I think you've got to look at it by geography, and so, there are places that are hotter than others from a wage perspective, and we're being competitive in those markets. There are certain types of positions where we're going to make sure that we are really competitive to ensure we're getting the right talent in those areas, but it's something that just it takes constant minding and paying attention to.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Right, okay, and then I guess thinking about capital allocation, I can think of one retailer so far in this coverage, Mike Howard University has announced resuming buybacks, and I know where you stand currently, but maybe how should we kind of think about that, is that something that we should not expect until we're back to whatever normal?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, we haven't talked specifically about buybacks. You saw, I mean you were saying that we didn't do any buybacks in the second quarter, but it's not something that you're likely going to ever say we offer on, it's we want to be more nimble than that. The way we think about capital hasn't changed. We're going to continue to put significant amounts of capital into the business, and when you look at our operating cash flow over the last five years, it have been $25 billion to $30 billion in cash flow, and when you look at the capital, we spend say 10 to 12, and the dividends around six, which we're very committed to that. Still leaves you a lot of room from a cash flow perspective. We've been buying back significant amount of shares, and there's a number of things that go into that decision on a quarterly basis. I still feel really good about the value of the company. So, share buybacks is something that certainly mid to long-term we were -- I feel like it's an important part of how we spend our capital.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And just remind us in terms of that if there were decision where you resume the buyback, you have a grid in place in terms of how you proceed, or maybe just remind people how that would work?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, that's typically what we do is we always have a share repurchase grid based on buying at certain levels of price on the stock, which is pretty typical of what most companies do.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, and then maybe last question, in terms of eCom, obviously you've indicated in the past that you're definitely willing to look at larger scale acquisitions on eCom. They're transformative, but you've also been divesting some of the eCom assets. So I think Shoes.com, I saw Bare Necessities. Obviously, we know Jet, what happened with Jet, maybe just -- maybe end with how you think about that from a strategic perspective?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, I think there is -- you know, certainly, we have opportunities to from a brand perspective or from a technology perspective, people perspective, those are the types of acquisitions that are enabling type acquisitions, we would continue to look at those, and we're just making decisions more quickly than we used to, and so, in the example of Bare Necessities and Shoes, both of those acquisitions helped us make significant progress in those categories from a brand perspective in stores online, and so, we benefited a lot from those acquisitions, and there's times where we're going to get the value that we think we need other acquisitions, and it makes sense for someone else to own them going forward, and to continue to focus where we want to focus. We'll make the decisions to not focus in places where we don't want to focus, but those categories are critically important to Walmart.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">All right. Well, I think maybe we're close to 1:10. Well, we are on the 1:10 mark. So, this is news to me in terms of how we get cut off. I don't want to suddenly get cut off, and hence I'm assuming. So, thank you very much…</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thanks, Karen.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">-- for being with us, and I'll see you again shortly in the next call.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, thank you. Take care.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Karen Short</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay.</p>
