<p class="p p1"><strong>Conference Call Participants </strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Itay Michaeli - Citigroup</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Itay Michaeli</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Well, good morning, everybody. My name is Itay Michaeli, I'm Citi’s U.S. auto and mobility analyst. And it's my pleasure to have Uber Technologies back with us at the Citi Tech Conference this year. We are delighted to have Nelson Chai, the company's CFO with us for a fireside chat. Lots to catch up on. So we'll get right to it. If you'd like to ask questions during the session, please e-mail myself, itay.michaeli@citi.com. I will be sitting on my other screen. And I'd be glad to get to your questions throughout the session.</p>
<p class="p p1">So with that, we'll kick things right off. Nelson, good morning, great to see you. Hope you had some rest in the summer and thank you for being here.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Nelson Chai</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Thank you for having me. I'm happy to be here. It is an interesting time as everybody knows. And so, most of us are working from home. And so, you’d think everyone has rested, but everyone is just like non-stop. So I'm okay.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Itay Michaeli</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good. Yes, I now, it definitely got busier summer than usual. So let's get right maybe into the -- probably two questions a lot of folks in the session are going to want an update from you on. First, maybe just at a high level, if you could talk about the latest trends you're seeing in terms of bookings and just overall trends in Mobility and Delivery thus far through Q3, now after Labor Day, because we see kind of less market observation there? </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Right. So we continue to see some progress in August. For the company, our total gross bookings was down less than 10% year-over-year in the month of August. Now, it's a tale of two halves, right? And so, there are some markets where we're seeing both Mobility and Delivery gross bookings up on a combined basis. So a country like France, where overall we're up year-over-year on a combined consolidated basis. The good news for us is that we're making progress on Mobility side. Although, I would say especially with some of the outbreaks in the U.S., the pace of recovery has slowed a bit. So our gross bookings for the Mobility side of the business are still down about 50% year-over-year in August. Again, that is mainly driven by the U.S. We've seen some recovery in Europe, where the marketplace is down about 32% of Mobility year-over-year in August. Latin America, I know there are a lot of cases in Latin America, but again, there the business is down about 40%. </p>
<p class="p p1">I mean -- a lot of it actually to do with what's going on in the U.S. And I think all of us are watching the news, we're seeing about what's going on. The last two weeks a little bit -- we knew cases were going to rise with kids going back to school. The only improvements we've seen is, there a few little bright spots for us. So the West Coast has definitely been slower in terms of the recovery. New York City for instance is down 48% year-over-year in August on the Mobility side of the business. And so, we're seeing some of that improvement. And those who are in the Metro New York area know just from a traffic perspective or if you walked around Manhattan that there is more activity. And so, we are benefiting from that. </p>
<p class="p p1">Our Delivery business continues to grow and continue to [vroom] [ph]. So again, our business was up over 130% again year-over-year in August, and improved on a month-to-month basis as well. We continue to build out, that business continues see to progress. We're very confident that as the recovery occurs, the Mobility business will recover. And at the end of the day, we're going to exit with a very strong position on the Delivery side of the business. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Right. So that's very helpful. I just got an e-mail that people are struggling to hear. As open exchange, I want to make sure we're definitely live at this point. I don’t know if the operator can help us?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. We are live. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Perfect. Okay, great. We just got a -- perfect, okay. Well, thank you Nelson for that update. And I’m just curious, talk into more of the details there. But as -- in the markets where you are seeing Mobility recover fastest, are you seeing any pullback in Delivery bookings, are they sort of concurrent -- or you’re actually able to see both Delivery and Mobility recover concurrently? </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">So in a place like France is a good example. And again, our Mobility business in France was down only 25% in August, but Delivery continued to grow over 130%. So again, these are case-by-case situations. I don't know that there's enough points that we would say that there's this total correlation. But we've seen particularly in a few spots where the Mobility is coming back at a better pace, in places like U.S. we have not seen any deceleration on the Delivery side. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Interesting. Okay. That's good to hear. I think we'll come back to these businesses. But the other topic I wanted to kind of cover here right off the bat, Nelson, of course, is the AED5 situation. Maybe if you can provide any update there on what's happening? I know there is a lot of things that can happen here and for sort of sensitivity into what you're able to say. But is there any way -- a question we’re getting from lots of investors is how to think about different scenarios both through Prop 22, as well as potential other proposals in other states that we read about? </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Cha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">So it's a fair question. If you live in California, you will start seeing the airways being flooded with the campaign on Prop 22. And we're confident that voters will support Prop 22 because at the end of the day it's actually what the drivers want. So we've done our polling and 72% of the drivers are in favor Prop 22. We don't really understand -- if you really understand the nuance around how this all came to be, most other parts of the contractor space were exempted. If you think about what we provide, as well as what some of our competitors provide as well, it's a flexible earning platform. If you think about the uncertainty in the world, if you think about the impact, the economic impact that COVID has had more broadly, the ability of the way to take away flexibility, especially with some of the uncertainty around school, and school is a main driver in terms of people's ability to go out and work, we just don't think it makes sense. And so, we've also polled drivers as well. And two-thirds of them would stop working if there was flexibility, right? </p>
<p class="p p2">And so, we had over 100,000 drivers in [indiscernible] signup for the Yes on 22 coalition. And so, this is not something -- it is pretty important here in terms of what the impact is going to be on the drivers. I know there's a simple answer that you’d pretty generally say, they should just sign them all as employees. It just doesn't work like that. At Citibank, if everybody wanted to be an employee, you don't just sign them all off, and so we would run our business. And the reality is that you would hire a fraction of the number of people and they would lose the ability to earn when they needed to earn or when they wanted to earn. </p>
<p class="p p2">And so, again, I think that as you think about what we're trying to offer, I think Dara has been upfront about talking about the third way. We do it in places like France where we can offer benefits to contractors. And so, again, we believe that we will win on Prop 22. </p>
<p class="p p2">Now, what happens if Prop 22 fails, and we're -- and we can't use independent contractors? We obviously are exploring different models, we would look at it. The likely outcome would be -- and I think you saw a Logan Green statement from Lyft last week that said that they like -- they would look to shut down in some parts of California. I don't think that's out of the reality. I think for sure what you would find is that even if you had some level of a model that might not be in all the cities in California, I think that riders would expect to see fares go up, because it would just happen over time. And so, again, we don't think that the outcome is a favorable outcome for either the riders and certainly [not] [ph] the drivers. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">But in terms of what may or may not happen in other states, there are a few other states that have an ABC test like Massachusetts and New Jersey, my bet is that they're all watching closely what's going to happen in California and see how it plays out. But again, the overwhelming number of the drivers actually don't want it. And as you know, we're getting a lot of support from a number of different mayors, as well as a lot of other folks around the union side. And so, again, we are hopeful that the voters will come out and vote. If they vote with the way the drivers want, and what's better for the marketplace as well and the cities and the riders, again, we believe we will win Prop 22.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Great. And then a follow up to that question we received is, if you do prevail in Prop 22, what are the implications on the other states and proposals? Is it kind of the issue kind of goes away or maybe we apply more of that third solution that you've been advocating for?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So, we'd love to sit down at the table and we've been open to it. At least in California, there hasn't been that willingness yet. We believe the third way is the right way. And so, we would continue to promote the dialogue. If the discussion went away, obviously as a CFO of the company and someone who looks at the stock price, I would like that. I would hope that it would certainly take-off some of the contagion risk that I know many investors have regarding this regulation. We’ll have to see how it plays out. But again, we are confident we'll get through prop 22 and you'll see a big outreach if you sit in California now between now and election, if you go in California, we ask you to go out and vote and hopefully you vote in favor of it, so thank you. </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Absolutely. Nelson, maybe I'll go into and ask some Mobility questions, then we'll go circle back to Delivery. And so, yes, maybe on Mobility, the first question is -- thank you for the update on what you're seeing in terms of demand. How about any update with respect to driver supply in Q3, kind of how that's progressing? </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, so particularly in the U.S., we were supply short in some of our markets. And so, even the recovery has been more muted versus other parts of the world, I think the expiration of the FPUC, which is the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation of $600 a week, that has been a tailwind for driver growth. I think as more drivers are getting more comfortable with what life is in the COVID world, and particularly the efforts that we've made, and so as you know we've led the way on PP&amp;E and other areas to try to make sure we're safe. I'm sure you've seen our advertising about No Mask, No Ride. And so we -- when we think through the best way for people to get moving again, we're pretty upfront in terms of making sure that the rides are as safe as possible. And so, that is something that we'll continue to do. And so, we've seen some -- the supply improve over time. And so, again, we'll just continue to see what's going on. And even if you look at whatever city you live in right now, people are starting to get out a little bit more, people are just trying to take more -- Ubers more. And that also means more drivers are out there as well. </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Right. Absolutely. And Nelson, one of the interesting data points I thought that came out of Q2 was, there was a slide about Hong-Kong, New Zealand and Sweden, and how rides there had recovered, I think above pre-COVID levels for workday commute and social trips. And so, airports aside for now, are you seeing other markets where commute and/or social trips are recovering either near or even above pre-COVID levels? </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So, again, it's still too early to call. And yes, we did call out a few kind of cities. They're smaller cities, at least in the scheme of Uber, if you will, but good data points. Yes, we're seeing people are moving more. I think like you said, airport trips are likely the one that will take a little bit more time, people are starting to definitely move more from a social perspective. And you see that across the board. And unfortunately, we're seeing it on TV when you go out and look at the different crowds, but people are definitely out there moving around. And again, it's a combination of people are starting to move within the constraints of that COVID is bringing, I think people are just six months into this are realizing they want to get out and then weather and other things contribute to it, especially things like Labor Day. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">So, we are seeing good trends in those cities. We're seeing in certain places like in New York, if you will. So, while there we are recovering faster than mass transit is, and so my question becomes, do we see longer term trends there in terms of broadening up use case into mass transit? So again, it's still too early to tell. Hopefully, we’ll get to recovery. Hopefully, people are right about vaccines and other things going on there. And most of the folks on TV are talking about recovery in '21. And so, that would be good. It'd be really good for our business.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. Yes. And I want to maybe kind of follow up. You mentioned about public transportation. And it's really interesting kind of question longer term about whether the Mobility TAM might actually increase for you over the longer term if sort of habits change. And could there be a longer term substitution away from public transport into rideshare? It’s definitely too early to tell. Are you seeing any signs of that in particular cities? And maybe a lead to that, as folks get back to work -- I know we’re still only -- so just trying to think about that, maybe on Uber for business as well?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, so maybe, right? Now, the counter -- and I'm speaking against my book, but you’ve seen that car sales were increasing a lot in the second quarter. I know you're an auto analyst and so you've seen that. And so people have thought a lot about safety. People thought a lot about the fact that getting in an Uber or a cab versus driving yourself, and then you think about getting in an Uber versus getting on mass transit. So I don't know what the puts and takes are going to be in terms of it. At least right now we're seeing that we are probably taking away from some mass transit as well. It may be in places like New York, I hear anecdotally that it's a combination of COVID and frankly for some people there's some safety issues going around in some of the largest cities. And so I think more people feel comfortable in an Uber than maybe taking the subway or mass transit as well. Well, it's too early to tell long-term, right?</p>
<p class="p p4">And so, you're an auto analyst, and my bet is that every year you think, okay, we're going to sell 17 million new cars in the U.S. up or down the line, right? And you would have thought it went down this year. And right now, as you know, I think we're supply constrained in cars because people weren't making them. And so, all sorts of things happen. I don't know that means that's a long-term trend that, that number is going to go up forever. So similarly in terms of the TAM for our business, we think we have a very large addressable market. We know that we will be part of the recovery as people start moving around again. </p>
<p class="p p4">In terms of how much we eat into the mass transit, we were already. To the extent we continue to have a safe and affordable ride, which we are in most parts of the world, I think we'll continue to do quite well.</p>
<p class="p p4">Your other question was just about what we're doing for Uber for business. So yes, there are some folks, the team is very, very busy. There are some things you can do with pooling type product, particularly putting in technology. So if you are going to work at Greenwich Street in Citi, we could put together a product, let’s say there's six of you leaving at a certain time, you want to Pool, even if one works in research, one works in capital market and one works in banking to go to a similar area. So we are exploring some of that. The reality is that it’s so small right now. The reality is most businesses aren't really going back in full force unless you're manufacturing in this country right now. And so -- but yes, there is opportunity for that and people are definitely looking at that.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">That's super helpful, Nelson. Maybe sticking on kind of automotive topics but for longer term, I want to ask a question about electric vehicles. Obviously one of your competitors in the U.S. has committed to an all-electric fleet by 2030. There are in our view a number of benefits here, but also we think a larger profit pool being one of those benefits, just another lower cost per mile. So how is Uber approaching EVs in its future strategy? And what are the different options for your company to increase EV penetration on the platform? </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So we are the largest by far mobility platform in the world. So we believe that it's our responsibility, just like we led on the safety report, right? So we're very proud of the fact that we put out the safety stats. When we did we had some investors ask me, why did you do that? And because if you want to make progress on it, you got to measure it. Similarly, we believe that we have to do our part to more aggressively tackle climate change. We are working with certain cities and involve in places like London as they think about how they're going to work towards a greener world as well. You probably will see something in a few hours on a global event fully dedicated to this from Uber coming out later today. </p>
<p class="p p5">One of the biggest barriers that we have is that if you think about the supply side and our ability to have electric vehicles on the platform, it's the drivers have to want to buy them, right, because they are independent. And they are more expensive as you know. And so for many of our drivers they opt against. And so if you buy a Toyota Camry, and you buy a Toyota Camry Hybrid, there is a price differential as you probably know. </p>
<p class="p p5">So we are going to continue to try to push it. We think it's very important. We did see our competitors’ commitment. There are a lot of caveats and a lot of this, a lot of that which lots of times happens. We will be -- we will definitely promote climate change and trying to do the right thing, if you will to tackle it. But again, it's a shared responsibility, if you will, with our driver partners. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Absolutely. Within that, Nelson, any thought to having your own fleet at some point, maybe in particular strategic areas or in small amounts? </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So, the company, as you know, has had been in the fleet business before, in something called UberEXCHANGE. It's not something that I'm particularly interested as CFO. So maybe another one comes buy and it's okay, I don't think we should be in an asset-heavy business. I don't think we should let manage the working capital. It doesn't mean we wouldn't partner with fleet businesses, we already do, right? So we'll partner with Hertz and other companies, if you will, to help provide access to cars or drivers. And then obviously in a place like California depending on the rules, if in fact things went against, you might see kind of a fleet type model for third-party fleets, not ours. But no, I don't think you'll see us any time that I can think of really trying to buy cars and operated cars. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">That's very helpful. And maybe on that point of saying asset-light, a question on long-term profitability beyond the COVID crisis. I think Mobility was running at 30% EBITDA margin or adjusted EBITDA margin in a few months before January and February before COVID really hit. Obviously, you've cut a lot of fixed costs since COVID. I think on the Q2 call, you iterated 45% long-term margin for Mobility. But who is the potential upside to that 45% given you were 30% before, cut a lot of fixed costs since then? What are some of the puts and takes we should be thinking about as the business comes back to that long-term operating margin, kind of cadence perhaps? </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So look, I think we're very proud of the fact that it was less than a year and a half ago we were on the road, and I would sit and meet with investors. The company was still investing and losing money even on the rideshare business. And we had investors ask us, when we were going to be a good business? I think that those investors and if you ask them, because I do, they would tell you, we said it was going to be over the course of 2019, we proved it was. And I think people would give us credit for doing what we said we would on the rideshare business. And then you're right, February year-to-date our EBITDA to net revenue margin was 30%. And we had confidence going into the year pre-COVID. </p>
<p class="p p6">I think right now, yes, we did take action on COVID. Yes, we thought it was an important thing to do in the second quarter. It was a combination of the fact that the company had built so fast so long. And so -- and thinking that you're going to go through a deceleration, if you will, in demand because of COVID, it's appropriate to take action. I think a refocusing on the core platform, and core platform could be the number of different things we're investing in, as well as the geographies. And so I think you saw us take action, whether it be do the deal that we did with Lime on bikes and scooters, or even exiting some of the countries which we announced in the first half of the year. Those were all important. I think those who know me know that I believe path to profitability is critically important. I think that if you even look at a company like Tesla that once they achieve profitability, their ability to do things increased dramatically. And so, I have the company focused on that. And so with COVID coming, our job is to make sure that we're well positioned for the future. And we have to make the moves that we made. </p>
<p class="p p6">In terms of its impact on the long-term margin, I’d say, once we get closer to 45%, I think it's a better time to ask the question. And we're really just focused on continuing to build our Delivery business, right, continuing to focus on Mobility recovery, if you will in COVID by continuing to really try to do what we can to help in terms of PP&amp;E and other things to help first responders to help our drivers and others feel safe. And then candidly, I think this is a difficult time. So hopefully, we’re making sure our employees are safe and stay engaged. Because I think it's difficult six months into this work from home, we're going to be doing work from home for a little while longer. And so, I think that's enough. And then at the appropriate time, we can update targets. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Absolutely. That's super helpful. Actually got incoming question that relates to my next question on R&amp;D. We see that despite all the cost cuts in the last couple of quarters in R&amp;D was only down modestly in Q2. And I think you mentioned on the Q2 call that autonomous testing had actually stepped up in the quarter. So just first, curious kind of how you’re prioritizing R&amp;D, the various puts and takes between what you're able to cut and where you're continuing to invest? And then maybe also an autonomous specifically, maybe an update there in terms of how you see the landscape shaping up? </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So what I said earlier, and just a moment ago, I mean a lot of the focus really was on what businesses we have to be in and focus on the core, and what countries we have to be in and focus on where we have leverage. R&amp;D is a little bit different and that most of the spending is around autonomous. We do view autonomous as critical to the core over time. I think the real question is, do we really have to develop it ourselves versus make sure that when it comes on our platform? I think you've heard Dara or myself or others at the company talk about the fact that we do believe that when autonomous comes to automobile, the best use case for it really is rideshare. And because we have the largest platform, because of the cost involved in developing it, you'd want to amortize it across the largest platform, which is ours. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">So we believe we will be part of the dialogue. It is important, at least we believe it is to be involved in the development process. Yes, our team has been active in terms of build hardware to make sure that we're hitting their milestones in terms of doing the testing and some of the work that they're doing. We do a lot of data collection, where it is not easy to do in terms of building an autonomous vehicle, especially as you think about first getting to Level 4 and Level 5 capability. </p>
<p class="p p7">And then as I said earlier, we will continue to look at everything we're doing. And we are committed towards our path to profitability. So, over time, you could -- because the amount of spending and the change depends. But I said we're -- there are no sacred cows and I -- we are committed to path to profitability. Right now, at least based on our view of where things sit today, we think that we can continue to invest in it. Hopefully, we get the recovery that people are at least more expert than me talking about that's going to come. But obviously, our job is to make sure we're managing the company. I'm very much focused on doing what I tell investors I'm going to go do. Hopefully I have in my tenure. And we will continue to review and look at all of our R&amp;D spend on a -- we do it on a pretty regular basis. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Absolutely. Maybe let last one on Mobility and also this has been very helpful, appreciate all the detail. And you mentioned Tesla, curious how Uber looks at Tesla in the overall mobility landscape. And given the importance of eventually EV and AV on rideshare platform, totally agree with. And Tesla kind of having publicly announced plans to have its own network, do you look at them as a competitor, what they're doing influencing your strategic choices about who to partner with and how to approach different strategies yourselves, just your thoughts there? </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So, at the corporate level, like we have a lot of respect for Elon Musk, and everything that he has done at Tesla. We're not necessarily overly concerned, if you will. On a personal level, I think he is a brilliant person. And if you’ve watched -- anybody who watches the SpaceX stuff going on, I mean it's incredible, right? And so I don't think anybody objectively could say what he what he is doing isn't incredible. That being said, as you know, they're taking a different approach to autonomous, they aren't using LiDAR, they're using sensors in the camera. Those that actually put in an auto drive and are basically doing R&amp;D for them and there have been numbers of crashes in there. We'll see what happens. I don't want to -- I don't discount anybody's opportunity to chances and everybody goes down the wrong path, right? And so just like people would have been a naysayer about what SpaceX could do, it's incredible, right? And so I have nothing but respect for what they're doing and what he is doing. Certainly because they want to hit profitability, obviously investors seem to love the stock because it's gone crazy this year. </p>
<p class="p p7">So, I'm not going to discount them but we think that we're on a different path. Our path is probably more shared by others in the community and others are focused on autonomous, whether it's us or some of the other competitors that I'm sure everybody knows. So, we're going down our path. That's what our team believes is the right path. Obviously, we watch everything that everybody does. And again, I have nothing -- we have nothing but respect for Elon Musk and Tesla, and so, I’d say. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Absolutely. That's super helpful, Nelson. So want to switch gears to the Delivery business. I think earlier, you mentioned you've seen continued strong trends through August. Curious just how the competitive environment is shaping in -- throughout Q3 thus far?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Well, so look, we continue to make good progress. I think over time, we've talked in the past about we think that there will be kind of a global chessboard, and we believe we'll be part of it. I think you'd have to assume Just Eats Takeaway as part of it. I think you have to assume Delivery here as part of it. I think DoorDash will be the wildcard because of their strong position in the U.S., and then we'll see what kind of consolidation happens. I think with Just Eats coming into the U.S., that is a salvo. Obviously, we are doing quite well in some of their marketplaces. We called that on the call, the progress we're making in the UK.</p>
<p class="p p8">And so we're -- our team is operating quite well. We're making good progress in our core markets. But we think that the chessboard will take a little bit more time to play out. Ultimately, we think large markets can handle a few -- a couple of large competitors, and the profit pools will be big enough over time, similar to what's going on in the mobility side. And we believe we'll, in our core markets, we'll be one or two.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Absolutely. Super helpful. And then maybe -- I know because we get this question a lot, but definitely worth going through it again. And it's just the company's goal of achieving a quarterly EBITDA profit in 2021, maybe just talk about how delivery plays into that. And maybe I don't know, perhaps quantify the portion of the business you think might be profitable by then and, yes, maybe some of the milestones we should be observing there?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Well, so I said before that if you look at by bookings, two of the top 5 countries already are profitable today. Yes, we are leaning in, in a strong way in some of the other markets that we believe that we're building. We have a market like the UK, where we're investing heavily. We have a market like Japan, where we're doing quite well, and we're not profitable today, but we're investing.</p>
<p class="p p8">As we think about next year, we talked about being profitable on a consolidated basis at some point next year, and we said without -- irrespective of what's going on in COVID recovery. So depending on what we see on COVID recovery, probably will inform this question about what we see in profitability next year for Delivery. Certainly, we expect that the economics will improve. I think if we sit a year from now from today, at least based on what I understand, Just Eats will own Grub, DoorDash will be public. There'll probably be some other moves between here and there. And so as the landscape starts getting more solidified, if you will, I think all the companies will be public or publicly owned. And so, I think you should expect that we'll see some of it.</p>
<p class="p p8">I think what's going on right now is a pull forward of demand in Delivery, and so think about in this country. And then I think over time, as you think about just the natural course of markets, you should see profitability follow. And so look, we believe that you'll see improvement. But depending how we do in other parts of our business gives us the ability to lean into certain market if we want to.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Absolutely. And maybe this is a question I'm sure you get a lot, Nelson. But as you think about, there's a lot of focus about Delivery profitability but obviously a stronger case for investing in growth just given the category expansion as well as groceries and essentials. And maybe talk about how you're balancing the need or desire to grow into these new verticals with the goals of getting to profitability? </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. So obviously, that's the secret sauce, right? And so there's some art, there's some science. Ultimately, we make the call, and we have a capital allocation process we go through. The business teams obviously have their desires. And if you just let them do everything they wanted, then yes, we'd be leaning in across the board. I think we've gotten pretty good at it. Certainly, on the Mobility side, if you think about how we've performed there, including even breaking out -- making EBITDA profitability in Q2 and doing better leading into Q3, we've gotten better at it, right? And so Pierre, who leads the Delivery business, understands the trade-offs. The team now has -- understands the trade-offs that we're making.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9">And so it is -- I can't say everybody is happy, but I think we have a good, robust dialogue and a good plan. And ultimately, a few people sit down in the room and we decide where we're going to lean in and where we're going to not. And I'd like to tell you everybody is always happy from those conversations, but that's obviously not the case.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Sure. Sure. No, it's all understood. And one question we have is just if you could provide an update on the subscriptions like Eats Pass and how that ramp-up is going?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">So it's going quite well, right? And we're approaching over 1 million paid members or so. The real question is going to be -- it's still early days, right? And so it's only -- it hasn't been available that long. We'll see over time how it goes. We believe that it will do well. We are testing some other things around it, whether it expands into Mobility, other channels like a grocery or whether we add things on there like ads and other things. So I would say it's still too early days, but we do think that is something that is a good long-term strategic move for us.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Great. Excellent. And then maybe moving a little away from Delivery into more big picture, strategic questions. Curious, just maybe an update on Freight and really strategically how you're thinking about balancing growth investments there with the company's objective of reaching EBITDA profitability at some point next year. How do you think about Freight in this context as well?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">So I like the thesis, right, in terms of coming in and disrupting a very large, right, mature-type industry. I think our team has done a good job. Our -- we'll do a little less than $1 billion of share revenue. We've really improved in terms of the cost per load, and the company has done a very good job internally in terms of managing that down, actually achieving what the year-end targets are already. The challenge right now with the Freight business -- and again, I don't know that you cover or not, it's a strange model because what happens is you got -- you go lock in your enterprise customers upfront, and that gives you scale. And then you make money on the spot. And the challenge right now is there's a real supply shortage for drivers right now, and so the spot is getting pretty tough. It's an aging demographic of drivers. I think COVID had some drivers kind of lay low a little bit more. And then on top of that, the $600 a week, the government plan has also had an impact as well. And so we're in an interesting market where there's actually a fair amount of demand and a big supply shortage. And so what that means is that volumes can be very good, but the gross margins are tighter or tougher.</p>
<p class="p p9">Our team has done a good job of building it out. As you know, in order to really get towards profitability, you have to have route density, and you have to have a good efficient market on both sides of this. The team has made good progress. You are right to call out the fact that it's not a consumer-facing business unlike the other businesses. Over time, this will be a continued question we'll have. The team is making progress today. We think that it can be a big business over time. And we see that because the number of digital transactions that are -- fully digital transactions that are occurring in a pretty manual-type business, we think we're on the right path. And so this will be an internal discussion we'll continue to have aggressively. But the team is doing a good job, and we like the progress in a very tough market right now.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. Absolutely. That's super helpful. And then one financial question that we occasionally get is the company's laid out the goal of adjusted EBITDA profitability at some point in 2021. How do we think about the timing within that of generating positive free cash flow, if we define free cash flow as cash from operations less some of the CapEx. Should that occur concurrently with the EBITDA achievement? Or is there perhaps a little bit of a lag there?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes. So I'm not going to get into the time table. I think our goal is to -- putting out the EBITDA breakeven is much more of a -- as a rallying cry internally because that's our internal number and externally as well, because that's how people do it. Obviously, I would like to see that over time. Obviously, I'd also like to see the point where we lead with our press release on not on net loss, which means you got to take out the stock-based comp as well. So those are things we're working towards. But again, the big focus right now is getting to positive adjusted EBITDA next year. And that's kind of where the focal point is.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Awesome. That's helpful. And then we've got an incoming question, just back on Delivery. I think you mentioned earlier about the 2021, how you expect the industry to unfold and whether you think that you'll see a similar glide path for Delivery as what you saw with rides in terms of companies coming public and then the discipline improving?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">So we'll see because I think they're still a year behind the maturity curve on the Mobility side. So to say in a year, is it going to be the same glide path? I think it would be an acceleration. But based on everything we've seen happen in 2020 across everything, forget about Uber's business, but just the broader world, I'm not going to say no. But again, I think if you looked actually at the maturity curves, it's more than a year behind. </p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes, absolutely, to the trade. And another incoming question we got was just, can you give any color on cash burn control and possible fundraising? And kind of how you're thinking about your balance sheet or even equity raise is a question which you got.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">So look, I think early on, we called out the fact that we think we have ample liquidity to get us through the crisis. Everyone knows it's something that I've been focused on, and maybe my background helped because I remember 2008 quite well still. And so I think we have ample liquidity. I think we'll take the steps necessary to make sure that we have ample liquidity to get through. I think if there's opportunities for us to raise capital, we likely would.</p>
<p class="p p10">I don't think we want to -- you'll see us do any kind of primary equity, especially where the stock is. We think the stock is undervalued. I think that it's being held down a little bit by COVID. So with some COVID recovery and then there's some questions about regulatory, would be my sense, talking to investors. And so I think if we can get through those, then we think there's good upside in the stock. And so this would not be the right time for us, particularly because we don't need the capital today.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Absolutely. And then one more I just want to touch upon. We kind of alluded to it before, but would love to sort of -- as we kind of have a couple of minutes left is to go back to the notion around long-term earnings power. And you kind of step back, Nelson, and look at all the things happening in the industry and the company, is there a case to be made that Uber's long-term earnings power might actually increase through the downturn, whether it's because of what's happening in Delivery and the recovery you're seeing now in Mobility? And maybe it is early to tell. And if it is, what are the metrics that you're looking at internally to inform you on that question? Like what are the key things you're looking for to understand that better?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">So yes. So the question is not, do I think that it's going to change the long-term. The question is, will we be able to achieve them at a different pace. And so nobody could have predicted what's going on this year with COVID. We do believe that when people start moving again, that they'll do it in Ubers. And so we do believe that business will come back. I think the one question mark is going to be the airport travel, which is sub-15% of the rides, at least in the U.S. And so maybe those take a little bit longer. And as we talked about earlier, there might be some substitution into some other parts of the business.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p11">I think what's going on, on the Delivery front certainly will benefit our company over time because what happens during these times is the weak hands go to stronger hands. And so you're seeing even the consolidation in some of the U.S., where the stronger players are going to continue. And I think you should expect that. Certainly, the focus on pulling forward demand has been beneficial because if you were to open a restaurant today in New Jersey -- suburban like New Jersey where you live, you would certainly think about delivery as part of your formula, whereas you may not have. And the ones that have actually have a good delivery business are doing -- are surviving. And some of them are doing quite well, actually. At least, I live in Rye, New York, and some of it -- a few restaurants are doing quite well.</p>
<p class="p p11">And so I think that will change the game because as more and more of the local restaurants are on the platform, as more and more families get comfortable with the use case realizing it's a pretty good thing to just order online and the food shows up, that actually helps the economics of the business because it increases the basket sizes. You have more users who aren't just ordering the small basket from McDonald's to getting a full family meal. And so that should probably be beneficial.</p>
<p class="p p11">And then the last part of it is, I think not just for our company but for all companies kind of navigating through this. I think the focus on efficiency and some of the moves we made in the second quarter will benefit the company long-term. I think as we think about as the business comes back, you would never add back at that same level. I think there's an enhanced focus on returns, if you will, in focus. And then the invest in everything, which was what the company did years ago, I don't -- I think that those days are gone. And so I think as you think about everything you're saying there, I think you're going to see a more focused approach from the company. </p>
<p class="p p11">And so I'm hopeful that your answer is -- the answer is yes. It may not be in terms of the ultimate margin. It just may be in terms of half the pace in getting there.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Itay Michaeli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Interesting. So the timing to get to the long-term target perhaps is...</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Nelson Chai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Yes.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Itay Michaeli</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Yes. Perfect. Excellent. Well, I think we're out of time here, Nelson. This was a really helpful discussion. Great to see you and catch up. Really appreciate your participation today.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Nelson Chai</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">All right. Well, thank you very much for having me. I hope everybody who is listening to the call can stay safe and stay healthy. And we all have to do our parts. And I ask you to -- if you're going to order Ubers, but please make sure you're wearing a mask. And if you live in California, please vote Yes on Prop 22. So thank you.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Itay Michaeli</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Perfect. Great. Thanks again. Thanks, Nelson. Take care. Bye-bye, everybody. Thank you for joining us.</p></div>
