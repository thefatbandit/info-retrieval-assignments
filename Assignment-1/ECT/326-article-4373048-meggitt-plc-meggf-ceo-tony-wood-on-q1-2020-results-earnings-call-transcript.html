<p class="p p1">Okay. Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to the 2020 interim results presentation for Meggitt PLC, where over the course of this morning's presentation, we'll provide an overview of our financial performance for the first six months of the year, our response to what has been an unprecedented period for the world and our sector, and a review of the strong fundamentals that make Meggitt well placed for the recovery as passengers return to flying. </p>
<p class="p p1">I'll begin by setting out our response to the crisis, including our key priorities, and providing an overview of our results and achievements before Louisa talks through the numbers in more detail. I'll then take you through the key characteristics and strengths of Meggitt that underpin our confidence in the future, before finishing with the outlook for the full year. And finally, we'll open it up for your questions. </p>
<p class="p p1">But first, as always, please note the following cautionary statement. </p>
<p class="p p1">So, clearly, it's been a very tough few months for the sector and particularly the second quarter, with a large proportion of the global population in lockdown, leading to a sudden and dramatic reduction in air travel, and the associated fall in demand for new aircraft and aftermarket services. </p>
<p class="p p1">I'm proud to say that, as a result of the resilience and determination of our teams, we were able to respond quickly and decisively to the anticipated and the subsequent reduction in demand in our business. </p>
<p class="p p1">Our ability to take effective and immediate action reflects not only the dedication of our employees, but also the work we've done over the last three years to transform the business, particularly the move to a less fragmented and more efficient and a customer aligned organization, and in building a high performance culture across the entire group. </p>
<p class="p p1">Having flagged the risk posed by COVID-19 back in February and applying experience from previous downturns, we moved quickly to establish crisis management teams across the group and formulated our own internal base case for planning purposes, enabling us to map out the likely changes in demand from our customers. </p>
<p class="p p1">Our response has very much been centered on those areas within our control. And our number one priority has been ensuring the safety of our people and supporting the communities where we operate. </p>
<p class="p p1">Secondly, we focused on business continuity, and adapting production in response to lower levels of customer demand, while providing support to our key stakeholders, including across our extended supply chain. </p>
<p class="p p1">We've also significantly cut back on operating costs to preserve cash through a number of internal actions, as well as accessing additional external sources of finance. </p>
<p class="p p1">And in April, we took the difficult but necessary decision to resize the group's global headcount, in order to ensure that we're right-sized for the second half and to position us for 2021. </p>
<p class="p p1">And finally, we've taken the opportunity to accelerate some key aspects of our strategy as we look to position the group for the future, and I'm going to cover these shortly. </p>
<p class="p p1">So, turning then to our individual end markets, in civil OE, deliveries of new aircraft by Boeing and Airbus were down 50% and 71%, respectively – staggering numbers – as airlines and operators deferred deliveries in their efforts to cut capacity, both this year and into the future. Deliveries of regional and business jets were also impacted, down 46% and 24% respectively. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">And as you can see from the chart at the top of this slide, we've seen a dramatic reduction in air traffic, with global RPKs down 90% in the second quarter, with up to 60% of the global fleet parked in April as airlines grounded a large proportion of their fleets as lockdowns were enforced and demand dried up. </p>
<p class="p p2">As economies have emerged from the lockdown, the restoration of domestic and shorter haul routes by the airlines led to a gradual increase in commercial capacity towards the end of the second quarter and into the third. </p>
<p class="p p2">In recent weeks, it's become clear that capacity levels and the state of the recovery remains highly sensitive to spikes in COVID-19 cases and the imposition of regional and local lockdowns and other meant measures, particularly post travel quarantining.</p>
<p class="p p2">Business jets, which represented 24% of our total civil revenue in the first half, outperformed commercial aerospace, with utilization 51% down in the second quarter, and only around 20% lower in July and August than the same period last year. </p>
<p class="p p2">And in our core US defense market, outlays have remained healthy, with total defense spending 6% higher than the comparative period in the nine months to June 2020, with growth rates in the segments that Meggitt is most exposed to, namely procurement and research, development and testing and evaluation, seeing strong growth in the period. </p>
<p class="p p2">And finally, in energy, while the oil price has since recovered from its low of around $20 a barrel in April to around $45 today, this has led to a delay in major oil and gas projects and a reduction in capital expenditure across that industry. </p>
<p class="p p2">So, while not immune to the overall weaker market conditions, we continue to see good demand for technologies to support projects in specifically liquid natural gas and the renewables space. </p>
<p class="p p2">Moving on to the overview of the first half, our book-to-bill of 0.9 times reflects the reduction in civil orders and the mitigating impact of a healthy book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 times in defense. </p>
<p class="p p2">As a result of the weakness in the civil end markets, which more than offset another strong performance in defense, group organic revenue was 13% lower than the prior period. </p>
<p class="p p2">Underlying operating profit was down 37% at £102 million, representing a margin of 11.1%. </p>
<p class="p p2">Having moved quickly to manage the business against our base case, we've made good progress executing a number of measures to reduce cash outflows this year. And while we have more work to do, including lowering inventory levels, we remain firmly on track to deliver £400 million to £450 million of cash savings this year, as we first outlined in April. </p>
<p class="p p2">As expected, the free cash outflow of £122 million was substantially offset by the sale of training systems, which was concluded during the lockdown period, with the group generating net cash outflow of £19 million in the half. </p>
<p class="p p2">And finally, while we're very aware of the importance of dividends to our shareholders, the Board concluded that it was prudent not to pay a final dividend for 2019. And in the light of ongoing challenging market conditions, the Board is not recommending the payment of an interim dividend for 2020. This will retain cash within the group, ensure the continued management of net debt levels and preserve flexibility in the near term. </p>
<p class="p p2">So, turning then to our strategy where we remain focused on executing our four priorities that we believe will continue to enable us to outperform the market over the medium to long term, and starting with portfolio where the sale of Training Systems takes the proportion of our revenue generated from businesses in attractive markets where we have a strong competitive position to 82%, now above our target of 80% that we set out three years ago. </p>
<p class="p p2">Moving to Customers where, during the first half, we booked new contract wins, amounting to over £100 million with a number of orders across our defense business, including a $73 million award for the supply of composite ice protection on the V22; a $22 million award for thermal management systems for the Abrams tank; and in Heatric, a multimillion pound order for heat exchangers, the largest order for that business in over five years. Certainly some signs of brightness there.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">We also have grown the number of smart support contracts and now have a total of 31 agreements, with an aggregate value of £175 million. These long-term contracts underpin our aftermarket and our market share growth in the future and provide valuable visibility of customer maintenance plans and for demand. </p>
<p class="p p3">And in Competitiveness, we've reduced the number of our global sites further to 39, following the planned disclosure of Basingstoke in the UK and Orange County in the United States during the lockdown period. This represents a reduction of over 30% against our 20% target set out in 2017, with further reductions in the pipeline, including most notably the transfer of production from four sites in the UK into Ansty Park in 2021 and where this presentation is being beamed from today. </p>
<p class="p p3">So, on inventory, we've steadily increased terms from just above 2 times in 2016 to 2.7 times in 2019. Our priority remains the reduction of absolute inventory levels. And whilst we're making steady progress, it's taking longer than first anticipated as our customers burn through their buffer stocks, whilst reducing their early demand signals in parallel. As a result, we now expect some of the benefits from this key cash saving to move into 2021. </p>
<p class="p p3">Our operational recovery plan in Engine Composites continues as we apply engineering and process improvements to achieve higher quality and further progress in yields, and we remain firmly focused on returning this product group to mid-teens margins, having made good progress last year. </p>
<p class="p p3">And finally, on Culture, our move to a more integrated team through our new organizational structure has been a key enabler as we move quickly to manage the business to our base case scenario. </p>
<p class="p p3">During the last few months, our priority has been to look after our people across our sites, and the response of our employees has been truly outstanding, enabling us to support all of our stakeholders in what has been extremely challenging circumstances. </p>
<p class="p p3">Our teams have also used their innovation capabilities to support our local communities in a variety of ways, from program managing the production of critical ventilators for the NHS in the UK to producing visors and masks and other protective equipment for key workers. </p>
<p class="p p3">As well as executing across our four core strategic areas, we've also taken the opportunity to accelerate our strategy in certain areas as we look to emerge stronger from the crisis. </p>
<p class="p p3">In Braking Systems, we're intensifying our focus on generating improved margins and returns, while continuing to remain highly selective on investing in new opportunities. </p>
<p class="p p3">And recognizing the change in fleet dynamics, we've also now significantly rephased and reduced our planned investment in both carbon and production capacity. </p>
<p class="p p3">In Engine Composites, the slowdown in demand has allowed us to accelerate the adoption of new manufacturing technology at our low cost site in Saltillo, Mexico. And the transfer of additional production lines is underway to enable the transition of further high volume parts in 2021. </p>
<p class="p p3">And on Footprint, we see additional opportunities to drive increased competitiveness and greater efficiency from reducing the number of sites further and we've set a new target reduction of 40% by the end of 2021 against our original starting point back in 2016. </p>
<p class="p p3">So, in summary, we've acted fast and we've made good progress on areas within our control. We've continued to execute our core strategy, and we've also identified additional opportunities as we position ourselves to emerge strongly from the crisis. </p>
<p class="p p3">And with that, I'll hand you over to Louisa to talk through the results on the numbers in more detail. Louisa?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Louisa Burdett </strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Thank you, Tony. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to take you through the results for the first half and also the progress that we're making to reduce cost, protect cash and resize our business. And as usual, I will start with a review of the income statement focusing on the underlying numbers. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">As you can see, the effects of the material reduction in Civil Aerospace demand can be seen throughout our income statement, including a reduction in organic orders of 31%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.9 times. </p>
<p class="p p4">On an organic basis, group revenue was 13% lower, slightly ahead of our estimates in our July statement, but with revenue down 30% in the second quarter, following growth of 6% in the first quarter. </p>
<p class="p p4">The organic reduction in underlying operating profit of 36% to £102 million reflects a combination of lower revenues, the relative split between fixed and variable cost within cost of goods, and finally, the impact of the group running for the majority of the first half as a full run rate on SG&amp;A whilst we worked through our action plans to reduce costs and resize the business.</p>
<p class="p p4">In a later slide, I will cover the good progress that's being made on our cost and cash actions, including an estimate of how this will impact 2021. </p>
<p class="p p4">Finance costs remained flat at £16 million and our underlying tax rate at 21% was in line with our guidance provided in February. </p>
<p class="p p4">So, taking all of this into account, underlying earnings per share was £0.087 per share. </p>
<p class="p p4">On the next slide, as a measure of our core trading performance, you are used to us talking about underlying operating profit, which as we showed you on the previous slide was £102 million in the first half. </p>
<p class="p p4">The items which are significant by virtue of their size or nature, or are considered non-recurring are excluded from our definition of underlying operating profit and are classified as exceptional items. </p>
<p class="p p4">So, in the first half, we have recognized significant non-cash impairment losses and other asset write-downs, which arise from the considerable uncertainty facing civil aerospace. And the size of these items mean that our underlying operating profit of £102 million \bridges to a statutory operating loss of £349 million. </p>
<p class="p p4">So, running briefly through the chart on the right hand side, we have recognized £373 million of impairment losses and other write-offs, largely in our Airframes and Engines divisions. And the majority of this impairment charge relates to goodwill of £341 million, with the remainder attributable to internal capitalization costs of £8 million and £24 million related to expected losses on receivables and stock. </p>
<p class="p p4">You can also see in the chart that we booked £13 million of COVID-specific costs, largely severance, and £15 million of site consolidation costs, which are principally related to Ansty Park.</p>
<p class="p p4">Our charges for acquired intangible amortization, financial instruments and disposals are also shown, but, importantly, those items with a cash impact are shown on the right hand column. </p>
<p class="p p4">So, turning to the next slide, which looks at organic revenue in more detail, and working down the left hand chart. Civil OE revenue was down 29%, reflecting lower demand from original equipment manufacturers. And as a result of lower levels of air traffic in the period, civil aftermarket revenue was down 25% as airlines and other aftermarket customers deferred orders for spares and repairs. So, overall, civil aerospace revenue was 27% lower in the first half. </p>
<p class="p p4">Defense spending has remained robust during the first half, with continuing good outlays in the US, and our orderbook remains healthy with a book-to-bill of 1.2 times, and that's underpinned by a number of multi-year contracts. </p>
<p class="p p4">Excluding Training Systems, which we sold in the first half, defense revenue grew 7%, with particularly strong growth in the first quarter. In defense OE, revenue grew 18%, driven by parts for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and rotary wing Apache, and defense aftermarket was 5% lower with growth in fighters more than often by lower revenue on special mission aircraft and rotary wing.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">In Energy, revenue was down 6% on an organic basis, with Heatric up 6%, reflecting a strong order book as we entered the year, offset by lower revenue in our valve and condition monitoring business. </p>
<p class="p p5">So, in a portfolio basis, on the right hand side, OE made up 55% of our first half revenue and aftermarket 45%. </p>
<p class="p p5">So, turning to performance by division. In Airframes, revenue was down 12% organically, with civil OE down 23%, civil aftermarket down 20% and defense up 1%. Underlying operating margin was 470 basis points lower due to the under recovery of fixed overhead from significantly reduced production volumes. </p>
<p class="p p5">In Engine Systems, revenue was down 20% organically, with civil OE down 38%, mainly driven by large jets. Defense revenue grew strongly by 16%, with good growth on the F-135 program. But as with Airframes, under recovery of fixed overheads from lower civil volumes is the principal driver of the operating loss of £9.7 million that you can see in this division in the first half. </p>
<p class="p p5">Energy &amp; Equipment revenue was up 8% organically, with a strong performance in defense systems, and underlying operating margin here was 9.3%, 200 basis points lower than the comparative period. </p>
<p class="p p5">And finally, in Services &amp; Support, revenue was 25% lower, with civil aerospace down 29% and defense 5% lower, with underlying operating margin broadly flat at 14%. </p>
<p class="p p5">So, on the next slide, we acted early and we've made good progress executing a number of actions to reduce cost, preserve cash and resize the business. Internally, we've materially reduced our operating costs, and we have scaled back or deferred a number of cost payments, including capital expenditure and pensions. And we also took the difficult decision to cancel the final dividend for 2019. </p>
<p class="p p5">As Tony has already mentioned, we've started to make good progress reducing inventory, but we have more work to do. And some of the cash gains anticipated from this initiative are now expected to move into the first quarter of 2021. </p>
<p class="p p5">Externally, from a financing and liquidity perspective, we secured access to the Bank of England and Her Majesty's Treasury's CCFF in April, providing up to £600 million of liquidity. And in May, we secured a forward start on our RCF, extending an element of this maturity out to September 2022. </p>
<p class="p p5">And finally, we have resized the group to reflect lower demand levels with that regrettable reduction in headcount of 18% at the half year.</p>
<p class="p p5">We believe we have taken the appropriate steps to navigate the crisis, but we do remain ready to take further action on our cost base should conditions in the external environment materially worsen. </p>
<p class="p p5">So, on the next slide, in response to that sharp reduction in revenue, we quickly put in place a plan to reduce our net cash outflows by between £400 million and £500 million to offset the potential increase in net debt.</p>
<p class="p p5">I'd like to clarify at this point that these savings represent cash that would otherwise have been spent in 2020, and therefore represents a hybrid of the following. Firstly, we will have some non-recurring cash savings, such as the cancellation of our dividend and pension payment deferrals, and then secondly, more permanent savings which will be carried into 2021, such as reduced headcount. </p>
<p class="p p5">And on this slide, I've just set out qualitatively how these cash savings are split between profit-related items in the left hand box and cash items in the right-hand box. </p>
<p class="p p5">And on the next slide, I've put some numbers to the savings. So, if you look in the left hand box, about half of the target savings are being delivered through what we've labeled cash-only items – dividend, inventory reduction, pension deficit payment deferral and CapEx reduction. And the balance of the target, in the right hand box, is being delivered through headcount reductions, lower operating costs, and lower material purchases, which have a cash and P&amp;L impact. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">The bars in dark green highlight where actions have been completed, the items in shaded green are in progress. And clearly, the reduction in purchase cost and inventory reduction require us to balance our desire to unlock and preserve cash in 2020 against the need for us to meet demand from our customers when it comes and to have stock on the shelf. </p>
<p class="p p6">Looking ahead, we expect a reduction in our 2021 cost base versus our 2019 levels of around £130 million to £140 million, and that principally reflects lower headcount. Other operating costs will revert to more normal pre-crisis levels in 2021 as we face into a recovery. and Depending on the degree to which these costs are added back, there may be an element of further 2021 savings, but at this juncture, £130 million is a reasonable estimate for the full year 2021 saving. </p>
<p class="p p6">Moving on to free cash flow where, as expected, we saw an outflow of £122 million in the first half, driven by the lower operating results and a number of other items which we've highlighted as normal in boxes. </p>
<p class="p p6">So, as follows, firstly, we had higher working capital, reflecting reduction in payables in the first quarter. Secondly, higher capital expenditure. COVID clearly hit Meggitt at an investment rich point in our cycle. So, that £57 million reflects our first quarter, early second quarter investments in Ansty Park and carbon capacity. </p>
<p class="p p6">Some of those investments that were planned for 2020 have now been rephased into future years. And for the full year 2020, we expect CapEx in aggregate of around £100 million, reflecting £30 million of savings versus our original guidance in February. </p>
<p class="p p6">Thirdly, we have an increase in cash exceptional costs. The bulk of these relate to severance associated with COVID. And lastly, as we guided in February, we have had higher levels of cash tax in the prior period due to the phasing of US payments. </p>
<p class="p p6">The free cash outflow of £122 million was largely offset by proceeds of £110 million from the sale of Training Systems. And we are really pleased to have managed to a relatively small net cash outflow of £19 million during such a turbulent period. </p>
<p class="p p6">And finally for me on our balance sheet, our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times at the end of June. That's well within our limit of 3.5 times. </p>
<p class="p p6">The left hand chart shows that, since December, net debt has increased by £89 million to £1 billion, and that's a result of the £19 million net cash outflow from the business that we've just seen on the previous slide, with the balance in FX due to weaker US dollar. Net debt of £1 billion at the end of June is lower than the equivalent position in June 19 of £1.124 billion. </p>
<p class="p p6">And on the right hand chart, we're showing you that we have headroom of £856 million at the half year against committed facilities of £1.7 billion, and we have access to an additional £470 million of the £600 million liquidity available under the CCFF. </p>
<p class="p p6">As I mentioned earlier in May, we secured a forward start on our revolving credit facility with the signing of a new one-year $575 million multicurrency facility which matures in September 2020. In June this year, we repaid $125 million on the maturity of a tranche of US private placement, and that was covered by bilateral loans which we put in place at the end of December 2019. And we have one remaining maturity of US PP notes in October this year of $115 million. </p>
<p class="p p6">So, briefly, before I hand you back to Tony, as part of our ongoing scenario planning and as we noted in our RNS statement of the 6 August, we have stress tested our balance sheet against a base and downside case through 2021. And those scenarios are outlined in our RNS. And under these assumptions, our covenant ratios in 2021 remain within agreed limits. </p>
<p class="p p6">I will now hand you back to Tony. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Tony Wood</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thank you, Louisa. So, I'd now like to spend some time to illustrate the strong fundamentals that characterize Meggitt and underpin our confidence in being well placed for the recovery. These are a diverse end market exposure, a strong aftermarket annuity, a relatively young fleet, and a strong defense business. </p>
<p class="p p7">We have diverse exposure both across and within the civil, defense and selected energy markets. Within our civil business, we have content on 51,000 aircraft and good exposure to large regional and business jets. And as I'll come on to talk about, within large jets, our strong exposure to narrow body fleet.</p>
<p class="p p7">We have an excellent defense business, representing 43% of the group revenue in the first half, as well as a fleet of 22,000 aircraft, and with strong positions across a broad range of platforms and categories from fighter aircraft to rotary wing, transport and tactical and also ground vehicles and defense systems. </p>
<p class="p p7">And across both our civil and defense fleets, we've increased our content on the newest platforms, securing future revenue streams and returns for years to come. </p>
<p class="p p7">And then in energy, which represents 10% of group revenue, we have good exposure to those segments that are less exposed to all price volatility, and expect to take a greater share of the energy market in the future, namely through the marked for LNG and renewables.</p>
<p class="p p7">Another key strength that's helping us to mitigate the impact of the crisis, as well as the ability to generate long-term sustainable returns is our strong aftermarket annuity across both civil and defense, underpinned by strong content and a higher proportion of sole source positions.</p>
<p class="p p7">The provision of aftermarket services by our dedicated services and support division has strengthened customer relationships and given us much greater visibility into aftermarket demand patterns and behaviors. </p>
<p class="p p7">As you can see from the chart on the bottom right, we have a diverse customer base across airline operators, OEMs, MROs and integrators, and it's this as well as our geographic spread that has provided a degree of resilience in our overall aftermarket performance in the period. </p>
<p class="p p7">The provision of our full service offering across both MRO and spare parts and services through our three regional hubs in Asia, Europe and the United States is providing us with valuable local market feedback as parts of the global market recover at different times and different rates. </p>
<p class="p p7">And finally, as I've mentioned previously, we continue to win back market share through our smart support offering, with six new contracts signed within the period. </p>
<p class="p p7">So, looking more closely at our civil aftermarket business where we've broken down our 2019 full-year revenue further, to illustrate the split between narrowbody and widebody aircraft, as well as their age profile. </p>
<p class="p p7">As you know, we benefit from having broad exposure across large regional and business jets. And within large jets, which represent 56% of civil aftermarket revenue in 2019, two-thirds of that is derived from narrowbodies, which along with business jets, takes the proportion of our total civil aftermarket in areas expected to recover more quickly to just under 60%. </p>
<p class="p p7">And then, turning to the age profile, which has received a lot of focus in recent months, and as you can see from the second chart, 54% of our 2019 civil aftermarket revenue was derived from aircraft less than 10 years old, the majority of which are yet to have their first and second shop maintenance visits. </p>
<p class="p p7">This underlines the strength of our business model and the investment we've made to refresh and grow content on the newest aircraft and provides a strong annuity long into the future. </p>
<p class="p p7">Another important point to highlight is that the proportion of the civil aftermarket revenue from older aircraft at 15% is relatively modest. And this also includes a number of freighters that typically have much longer in-service lives than passenger aircraft, and the majority of which continue to fly.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">And looking beyond the near-term recovery timeline of the next few years, we see a number of core drivers supporting the growth in our civil aftermarket revenue for the years to come, including an RPK growth outlook of somewhere between 3% and 4% per annum, price increases across our portfolio, recapturing of market share through smart support, as well as that increased content that we've secured on the new fleet. </p>
<p class="p p8">And then, just moving on to cover our defense business quickly, which represented 43% of the group revenue in the first half and where robust levels of growth continued, underpinned by our core US defense market. And as well as benefiting from having strong content on some of the newest and hardest work platforms such as the F-35 and the F-18, our growth in recent years has also benefited from higher levels of refresh and retrofit activity and also a number of multiyear contracts and that broad exposure across different end platform categories. </p>
<p class="p p8">Moving forwards, we believe that our existing positions, strong technology and opportunities to increase market share in wider defense applications such as UAVs, ground vehicles and space will continue to ensure that defense provides a cornerstone for group performance and profitability as the recovery in civil aerospace continues. </p>
<p class="p p8">So, before I move on to the outlook for the full year, this slide provides an overview of our strong exposure to business jets, which when taking OE and aftermarket together, represented around 11% of total group revenue in the first half. And as we've already mentioned, this part of the market has provided an attractive alternative to commercial flights during the last few months, and is likely to continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p class="p p8">As well as having a market leading position on wheels and brakes, we also have strong airframe and engine content across a broad range of manufacturers and platforms, including some of those that have recently come to market. </p>
<p class="p p8">So, before concluding, we've set out this slide on our working assumptions for the full year. While the gradual improvement in some segments of commercial aerospace is encouraging, particularly domestic travel and business jets, it's clear that the state of any recovery remains highly sensitive to national spikes in COVID-19 cases and the progressive reopening of international borders, making any firm predictions about our full-year performance extremely challenging, including what has historically been our most important fourth quarter. </p>
<p class="p p8">In our base case, for civil aerospace, we assume that new build rates remain at or near current levels, and the progressive recovery in air traffic feeds through into aftermarket revenue in the second half. </p>
<p class="p p8">In defense, we expect outlays in our core US market to remain robust for the rest of the financial year and conditions in our energy end markets to remain stable. </p>
<p class="p p8">And for cash, as a result of a proportion of inventory reduction moving into 2021, we now expect to be broadly free cash flow neutral for the full year. </p>
<p class="p p8">So, based on the above and recognizing that there could be a range of outcomes in our civil business in the last four months, leading to a significant variation in where we finish the year, our guidance for the group for the full year remains suspended. </p>
<p class="p p8">As we move further through the second half, we're going to continuously review the shape of the recovery in our end markets to ensure our businesses are aligned appropriately. And we plan to provide a further update and full year guidance in our third quarter trading statement on the 10th of November. </p>
<p class="p p8">So, in summary, this has been a challenging period for Meggitt and for the entire industry. Our teams have risen to this challenge, and I'd like to thank them personally for their response which has been outstanding.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9">We've taken action where we can to mitigate the impact of the severe downturn in civil aerospace, and we remain focused on carrying on this hard work for the remainder of the year and beyond. </p>
<p class="p p9">Alongside this, we've continued to serve our customers and execute our strategy, while protecting investment in future growth. We've also identified ways to accelerate our transformation and emerge strong from the crisis. We've strengthened our liquidity and have very good levels of headroom on our facilities. And as a result of the measures we continue to take to preserve cash, we expect to be broadly cash flow neutral for the full year. </p>
<p class="p p9">And while we've still got more work to do and uncertainty remains, our diverse end market exposure, along with strong fundamentals, which I've covered, means we're well placed as the recovery continues. </p>
<p class="p p9">So, on that note, we'd now like to invite your questions, which will be hosted by our webcast provider. And I think they're just about to open the lines now. </p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p9"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Michael Tyndall at HSBC. </p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Michael Tyndall</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">It's Mike Tyndall from HSBC. A couple, if I may. First, I'm just trying to get my head around the scale of the inventory issue. So, when you say free cash flow neutral, are we talking before, after the disposal of MTS? And then, when we think about customer draw down, any sense of where we are in that in terms of when we might actually start to see those orders coming back through? </p>
<p class="p p9">And then the second question, I feel like it needs to be asked, is just on the equity raise. You've tried to address that issue. You've said that, in the downside scenario, you have sufficient financing. I just wonder if you can just give us a bit more feel for what the thoughts are inside Meggitt as to the need or otherwise for fresh capital? Thanks. </p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Maybe I'll start and obviously Louisa and I will sort of work through the three questions you've asked there. So, I think the first one on inventory is to recognize why we think it's going to phase into next year. And the reassuring point of our base case plan is that we've called the market back in April pretty much where the market is now landing. So, some reassurance to that. We've been tweaking that model as we've been through the last few weeks. But what we have seen, and it's quite challenging sometimes, if you think of the breadth of our portfolio where we're predominantly a tier two supplier, we do get a bit of noise on the signal and we can't always see the buffering that's going on between, say, a Boeing and an Airbus, an engine company, and then the parts that we're supplying. So, we've seen some of those buffers starting to be stripped out. And that's been part of the reason why it's now going to phase into next year. </p>
<p class="p p9">But in terms of the cash flow absolute in terms of whether or not…</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Mike, just to confirm, that statement about free cash flow neutrality is pre MTSI disposals. </p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">So, hopefully, that clears that one up, Mike. In terms of the order outlook, essentially, the reason behind us not giving guidance, civil aerospace is a big part of our business. I think we've given you, hopefully, a lot of the building blocks. But even opening the newspapers and listening to the radio this morning, we're still seeing actions of the airlines ultimately, with ongoing uncertainty with quarantine restrictions, the closure of many of the international borders still, it really is jockeying around on a day to day basis. And what was looking like a progressive recovery is now looking like a much more uncertain quarter four. Many of you on the line will have read the EasyJet announcement this morning. But if you just look over the last three or four weeks, there's a lot more uncertainty being suggested, and there is absolutely a reduction in the schedules for quarter four versus what was planned about a month ago. So, we're reflecting some of that in our outlook. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10">That said, defense strong, as we've said consistently throughout the presentation, and some encouraging signs in energy, albeit in a slightly softer outlook than we're seeing in defense. </p>
<p class="p p10">But if you want to add anything on orders, Louisa.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">We need to address equity.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">And then, on equity, obviously, a bit of speculation in the press a few weeks ago that we had to respond to. The bottom line is, we're making fantastic progress against the £400 million to £450 million. It was a big goal that we set ourselves out as a team. We're performing well against that. We absolutely recognize the sort of outlook there and what we've got to do, but there is no requirement based on the stress testing that we've done. A lot of thought being put into that and hopefully sufficient detail for people to see that in what we've modeled. No requirement for equity. But, obviously, like any business, to take that completely off the table forever is not something, if you're sitting in my or Louisa's chair, that we'd ever do. But, certainly, based on what we've modeled, there is no requirement to raise equity. But I don't know if you want to add to that.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Our next question comes from Robert Stallard at Vertical Research.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Robert Stallard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">A couple of questions from me. First of all, with regard to the large aircraft aftermarket, what are your expectations for older aircraft retirement rates going forward from here? And are you seeing any pickup in that? And is that leading through to the surface market? </p>
<p class="p p10">And then, secondly, on business jet, I was wondering if you could share with us your expectations for both the OEM side of things and the aftermarket over the rest of the year?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Maybe just to pick up the large aftermarket one first on retirements. So, we do expect an accelerated retirement, particularly of the older aircraft and those over 20 years old. My expectation is that where we were previously planning something like a five-year horizon for those aircraft to be retired, we'd expect that to now happen over about a three-year period, with about 50% of those aircraft retiring over the next 12 months. It's quite interesting that we've actually seen very little retirement sort of being labeled on aircraft at this stage. There's a questionable value, I guess, over an aircraft when there isn't really a surface market, there isn't really a demand. </p>
<p class="p p10">So, I think as the world returns to flying again, then you'll start to see those older aircraft being pulled out over the next three years. And then, you'll start to see the surface market, but it's going to take some time. It takes a while for an aircraft to be stripped apart and for the surface market to be primed. The surface market is pretty dead at the moment, but it will return. And we do expect that to be a feature of our business. And we've sized that for you previously in terms of how we think that affects us. But it's fairly modest in terms of – it's not all of our portfolio which is exposed to surplus risk. For instance, our wheel and brake business has very little surface exposure. </p>
<p class="p p10">As far as business jets on the OEM, the aftermarket, the good news is that business jets, as expected, have recovered faster. We're running down – latest data that's published, I think it's about 17% down in July based on where they were last year, so still not quite recovered, and a few bumpy days. But we did see some days in July, particularly in the United States, where utilization was ahead of last year. So, we'll see how that evolves. But that bodes well for the aftermarket and the signal that we'll get on that.</p>
<p class="p p10">We do have some slight lumpiness on business jets because we provide the spare parts through the platform makers, rather than direct to the operator. So, it'll depend on their buying behavior in the last quarter as to whether they stocked the shelves and, obviously, they'll be looking at how business share recoveries go. But on aftermarket for business jets, boding reasonably well, but not quite back to last year's levels. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p11">On the OEE side, again, we have reduced those. We made that assumption back in April. And we're pretty much tracking the reductions that we expected on the programs that we're on. </p>
<p class="p p11">So, I don't know, again, if you want to add on that one. </p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Next question comes from Nick Cunningham, Agency Partners.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Nick Cunningham</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">A couple of questions. Back to the liquidity and looking at slide 17, you guys have got very generous headroom at the moment, which diminishes as we go out towards first half of 2022. Is that still a comfortable level? Or would you want to do some refinancing, mostly debt, in the meantime? And if so, what would be a level of comfort that you'd like? </p>
<p class="p p11">And the second question, you tend to get very engaged with the covenant issue or have done in the past. Is it really something we should worry about? What happens if you do breach covenants? And we've seen with other companies, [indiscernible] for example, that those effectively just got released from covenants. It's, obviously, for a short period because of external circumstances. Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">I can take both of those. So, on the liquidity point, I think we've provided you with, hopefully, a lot of comfort about the access to liquidity that we have both from our existing lenders and from the CCFF scheme should we need it. Obviously, that debt tails off as we go further out into the mid-2020s. And as you would expect, even pre-COVID, we would be looking at that refinancing strategy for 2022 and beyond. So, yes, we are going to be looking at that in the coming months.</p>
<p class="p p11">In terms of the covenant, we've provided quite a lot of detail about our base and downside modeling in RNS and have provided assurance that, under those assumptions, that our covenants are not breached. And as you would expect, as we talk to shareholders, we keep our relationships open about our business performance with our banks, but we are aware of other peer groups talking to their banks about waivers, but I think our scenario model should give you to go a long way to provide comfort that we have stress tested that for a downside scenario. </p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Nick Cunningham</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Just a follow-up. I think the CCFF expires in the first half of next year, at least that's the current plan. Do you expect those to be rolled over and maybe to be available funding for you for a longer time?</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">So, the important point to note here is that, in our scenario planning, we have not assumed that that CCFF is available to us post May 21 when it is officially withdrawn. So, I'm not sure that that's actually a risk for us. </p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">The next question comes from Celine Fornaro at UBS. </p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Celine Fornaro</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">I have two questions, if I may. My first one would be trying to understand between the Airframe Systems and the Engine Systems. If my memory is right, most of the business jet exposure would be around the Airframe Systems. So, I'm just trying to reconcile the strong decremental margin that you have when you looked in H1 this year compared to H1 last year, which was close to 60%. So, how should we think about that, looking into the second half, if the biz jet, they recover, but maybe no more than these recent July starts that you've mentioned and we still have two full quarters of potential aftermarket headwinds on large jet? Because I'm very surprised by the impact on the margin on Airframe Systems. So, a bit of color on that would help. </p>
<p class="p p11">And then, my second question is regarding some of the recent comments on Wizz Air. Slower capacity growth into the end of this year and potentially early next year. And what's the impact for you on your A321neo brake selection and certification plan? And when you have enough time to cut capacity further, for example on something like that, or is it too short notice? </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Celine, it was quite difficult to hear your first question. So, apologies if this misses the mark, if I make some general comments about Airframes and Engines margins and then maybe pass over to Tony. </p>
<p class="p p12">The overriding factor around the fall in margins in both of those divisions is clearly the loss of production capacity. So, we had a business that was geared for growing a £2.3 billion business, and essentially we've lost a lot of that volume with a fixed cost base and we've clearly taken action to do something about it. But the negative leverage is keenly felt, particularly. And you'll notice the differential in the divisional summary, particularly in Engine Systems where there's nothing else going on in there apart from the effect of that negative leverage. And if you think about what we said in February, engine composites, in particular, was just exiting 2019 at a breakeven rate. So, that loss of leverage when we've almost got dual running costs and a fragile recovery is quite keenly felt. </p>
<p class="p p12">In Airframes, we did have some benefit from quite a high activity in the first four or five months in the brakes business. So that, again, is helping that margin in the first half, but those are more directional comments. I couldn't quite hear the specific point. So apologies if that's not hit the mark.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Maybe just to add to that, Celine, the best way to describe it, if you ever wanted an image is, if you think of the first quarter for Meggitt, it was a supertanker on full steam ahead. And we've had to pull back the handle and also go fullest turn in a very short space of time. Our breaking business, we had every furnace running pretty much seven days a week, trying to slow down CapEx investment and push that into next year and make absolute best use of the assets we had. And then, obviously, with the drop in demand, we've got unrecovered overhead and we'll be battling through that in the second half. We've sized that business on the basis of where we think the entry point to 2021 is. So, that's the sort of dynamic. But, actually, to be right on that £400 million to £450 million, I'm taking some comfort that the team have actually responded very well and we're on plan there. </p>
<p class="p p12">As far as Wizz Air goes on the A321, they are our launch customer, as you're aware. Continue to work with Airbus on that one. There have been some delays in the certification program. Flight test crews and such like in Toulouse were affected by that. So, we're delayed somewhat. Working very closely with Airbus and Wizz Air on that one, but our equipment is ready, all ready to go. And clearly, we've got the ability to ramp that over time. </p>
<p class="p p12">We've tailored that ramp up. We've got more time now with the visibility on the reduced demand on some of our other programs. So, we have curtailed that forward investment, but our lead times are such that we can keep up with that as the program develops, but going to be some further work with Airbus on that to complete the certification. </p>
<p class="p p12"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Next question comes from Zafar Khan at Société Générale. </p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Zafar Khan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">I have two questions, please, if I may. The first one is just on the 18% headcount reduction that you've already achieved in H1, which I have to say is very impressive indeed. Could you please just give me some idea of where that's coming by business line and by geography? That's the first question. And just related to that is the – you've given some indication of £130 million to £140 million saving on the headcount reduction in 2021, and I think £68 million in H1. Is the full year this year going to be around about that sort of £130 million, £140 million as well? </p>
<p class="p p12">The second question is just on – I know you haven't given any guidance, but just on the sales and the recovery trajectory of sales. Obviously, Q2 was hit very hard indeed. Any indications of what H2 looks like on the sales side? </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">I'll perhaps pick the first one up and then pass to Louisa on run rates and such like. So, it has been challenging. But the 18% headcount reduction that we had achieved by the end of June was a real credit to the work that our teams have done. It wasn't a salami slice. We did it in a very targeted way, looking at essentially a model. And we've focused those reductions in both – certainly to recapacitize very much around the drop in civil aftermarket. So, it's those product lines and those aircraft that we anticipate are going to be lower production volumes on OE and where we think the aftermarket is going to be most impacted. So, as you might expect, big slices of the braking business and certainly those other businesses that have got a large exposure to civil. </p>
<p class="p p13">In some of our defense businesses, frankly, we've grown headcount in the first half where we've got volume coming through and we're keeping productivity tight. But, clearly, we do need capacity in some of our businesses. That 18% will evolve further. We'll be well over 20% by the end of the year. There is a plan. I don't want to get ahead of our workforce on that. But we'll close the year in excess of 20% reduction. And some of those have been announced internally over the last couple of months since the half year.</p>
<p class="p p13">In terms of the phasing of the numbers behind that, maybe Louisa, if you…</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Just to also add to what Tony said that, where possible, we've tried to align that reduction to where we planned to reduce footprint anyway. So, trying to link both the tactical with the strategic.</p>
<p class="p p13">In terms of the £130 million to £140, yes, on an annualized basis, the chart – I can't remember what chart number it was, we've got £70 million. And that's predicated on sort of actioning that late in the first half. And just to give you a little bit of math, our 2019 payroll costs were around £800 million. So, around 20% off of that means that we should be, as I said, about £130 million to £140 million better in 2021. Did you want me to comment on sales guidance as well? </p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">If you wish, yeah.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Just broadly in terms of sales, clearly, a very difficult Q2. July has followed similar patterns to Q2. And August, also looking similar, but we don't have the detail of the end markets yet. And just to loop back around to what Tony has said in terms of our framework for the year, this is why it's quite difficult for us to provide that guidance on civil because it's quite hard, especially given some of the movements in previous weeks, whether it's going to be a pattern of sort of high, low, low, progressively better or high, low, low, low. So, it is quite difficult to forecast that as well as the mix and the profitability in those businesses. So, apologies we can't give more specifics than that. But it is the part of our business that is the hardest to predict in the fourth quarter. </p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Yeah. That is the challenge, really, for us that, I guess, if you look at IATA data, the world has been 70% to 80% lower for four months. They're reporting out to the end of July. Frankly, I'm not expecting August to be any better than that. So, that's five months potentially. And then, September, who knows. If you look at the US carriers and you look at the European carriers, there's definitely a lot of uncertainty out there and people taking haircuts on capacity growth in quarter four. Whilst China's recovering, it's really what happens in Europe and North America that is our focus at the moment in terms of driving that quarter four recovery, and it's quite uncertain. </p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Zafar Khan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">It's quite interesting that you declined to give any guidance for the full year. It's pretty much in line with – I think Boeing and Airbus haven't given any guidance. But I am surprised that a number of other aero and defense companies have actually stuck their necks out and provided a full-year guidance. It's going to be interesting how will they deliver on that? </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Yeah, one for others to comment on, I'm afraid, on that one. Yeah.</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Our next question comes from George Zhao of Bernstein. </p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="question">George Zhao</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">So, what was the orders decrease in civil aftermarket in H1 or Q2? Just total company orders was down more than revenue decline. And I presume most of that was driven by civil aero. So, I was wondering you could give any details on that. </p>
<p class="p p14">Secondly, you've been talking about this £400 million to £450 million of cash outflow reduction. Clearly, they'll be offset. So, what kind of revenue fall through and decremental effects are you assuming in the base case? Given your brakes aftermarket is one of the highest margin business, what will be the impact on margin as activity there remains subdued in the upcoming years? Thanks.</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">I'm not going to get into providing lots of sort of slicing dynamics. We're giving, I think, a lot of clarity on the near-term outlook, albeit absent guidance for the end of the year. Order intake has been significantly down. We've benefited from some positivity in defense. Obviously, that 1.2 times book-to-bill. But we're much softer on the civil aerospace. But I don't really want to get into slicing that at this stage. We'll certainly comment more fully on that when we report in November. </p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Just on the comment around the £400 million to £450 million, that program was specifically designed to help us offset what would have been an increase in net debt if we had done nothing and stood still. Clearly, we've got other parts of the business that will be generating cash, but, obviously, there's quite a lot, as you pointed out, George, in the rump of the business where the cash flows don't flex as easily with revenue, the obvious culprits of tax pension and overhead. So, we do have headwinds in there. I think you can see that in our divisional results where we've seen declines in operating margin, but they are, broadly, those fixed costs that we can't move quickly enough, given the significant reduction in volume. So, that is our main focus at the moment. </p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">I was just going to go back, operator, to Zafar's question actually on headcount. I think we covered the capacity piece of it very clearly, hopefully. Fairly significant reductions in SG&amp;A as well over the period. So, we have taken the opportunity to look at the way that functional support and central support is provided across the group. And we have flexed that in line with the reductions that we're seeing elsewhere. So, the spread of that reduction is entire business, even though we very much targeted the capacity reductions into the civil aerospace area. </p>
<p class="p p14"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Next question comes from Sandy Morris at Jefferies.</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="question">Sandy Morris</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">If you do give guidance, I don't think it's [indiscernible] on the margin target. Just on this goodwill thing, and I know this is a strange thing to pursue, we had lots of headroom at the end of 2019, but I can picture how the combination of lower single aisle production at Airbus and the continued issues with the MAX have potentially weakened the outlook on Engine System. So, bluntly, is Engine Systems the biggest chunk of the goodwill impairment?</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Sandy, when we buy businesses, as you know, we attribute goodwill to an acquisition. But once it's been within our stable, that acquisition for a few years, it's quite hard to sort of match the cash flows that we bought to what's actually in the division, so that the technical answer is that we generally can't relate that £341 million to a specific acquisition because of the integration of those cash flows. And we have to assess it at a divisional level. We have provided you with information that it's in Airframes and Engines where most of that impact has happened. And you know that our most significant acquisitions are the Polymers &amp; Composites acquisitions in 2015, which are now both within Airframes and Engines, and obviously further back, PacSci and brakes. But generally, it's just all about our five-year fleet forecast and how that relates back to that carrying value on the balance sheet. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p15">Actually, what I was quite pleased with is, when we did the stress testing on that, that our internal capitalized costs actually took a relatively small haircut, which demonstrates we've still got quite a lot of value within those programs that we are generating internally as well. So, sorry for the techie answer, but that's the reality. </p>
<p class="p p15"><strong><span class="question">Sandy Morris</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p15">I get accounting is [indiscernible]. And then, coming back to the 737 MAX thing and just on inventory, my impression was that actually Airbus managed to have a very swift inventory correction. And obviously, you were emulating that or trying to emulate it in terms of purchasings coming down. But I have to say that, while Airbus may now be sorting itself out, the MAX will be causing you a bit of grief, but I've got no idea of what rates you are making or delivering on MAX and whether that's all halted effectively? </p>
<p class="p p15"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p15">We are delivering, Sandy, but not very much is the simple answer. I can't get into disclosing exactly what build rates – and I think as I've said before, we have direct exposure to Boeing where we ship directly into the plants in Everett and Renton. But equally, we've got indirect because we go through suppliers like Spirit who are providing either the fuselage or the thrust reversers and such like and then the sales. But we are acknowledging the customer's request and managing our risk on inventory carefully on that is probably the best way I can say it. And staying fairly closely aligned with the demand signals that we're seeing from across the industry on that. So, still some work to do.</p>
<p class="p p15">As we all know, the MAX is an important program. And we're all waiting for that recertification and entry into service, but it's going to be a long climb out, I think, for all of us to redeliver nearly 800 aircraft and then get back on to some kind of sensible production rate. </p>
<p class="p p15">So, we spent a lot of time on that with Boeing and with our internal factory schedules to try and take a balanced view on the risk on inventory. But you're right to quiz it. We're further ahead and it's a bit more straightforward as you suggest with Airbus. </p>
<p class="p p15"><strong><span class="question">Sandy Morris</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p15">And then, one last thing, just coming back to this financing stuff and headroom and all the rest of it. For all intents and purposes, it looks to me as if your free cash outflow largely happened in the first quarter. You know, the usual seasonal pattern probably. And we haven't quite managed to sort it out because of what happened in the second quarter. But if you track the way – leaving aside leases and FX, your actual cash debt was moving. One, I don't see why – as I think you said, you'd want to go near the CCFS any more than you have done. And two, I can't see why debt markets wouldn't be open to you. I don't know if you've tested them or can actually comment. But candidly, I would have thought they are. </p>
<p class="p p15"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p15">So, Sandy, your point about the cash outflow in the first half are well made. We have a very big Q4, which has an impact in our Q1 outflow. And this year was no different, maybe a bit larger because of – it was a big Q4 last year and we had quite a lot of investment. </p>
<p class="p p15">To the debt markets, I hope I haven't given the impression that the debt markets are not open to us. And I believe that, clearly, the pricing that we would get of any future debt would be sentiment around the aerospace and defense industry, generally, but I think that it would also reflect what we as Meggitt have done to effectively control what we can control. </p>
<p class="p p15">But the just on the specific point, it's probably worth making here, the forward start RCF, which we secured in May, which was at the height of some of the turmoil, is on similar – based on identical covenants and terms to our other businesses. So, I think that other businesses, other debt, that should give confidence that as we go through these discussions that the debt markets are indeed open to us. </p>

<p class="p p16">Our next question comes from Harry Breach at MainFirst. </p>
<p class="p p16"><strong><span class="question">Harry Breach</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p16">Sorry if I didn't catch some comments Tony made earlier. Tony, just on smart support, you talked – you gave some data points. Are you able to let us know either for the full year 2019 or for the first half of this year, sort of what percentage of your overall aftermarket revenue, smart support revenues represent – just so we can get a feel of its scale and context. </p>
<p class="p p16">And then, I wanted to ask just a little bit about defense organic revenues, just the second quarter, I think down about 3%, if I remember well from the appendix in the slide pack. Just wonder if you can give us any sort of feeling about the sort of drivers of that, whether they were just phasing or whether you're starting to see more recent sort of US budget slowdown start to manifest themselves in sort of purchasing patterns. </p>
<p class="p p16">And then, just the final thing with – it was great to see the age breakdown of the civil install base that are making a return. Interesting, in particular, to see the naught to 10 year old doing a slightly higher percentage of that. I just want to tell you, is there – and yet, in recent years, your civil aftermarket growth has been around sort of 7%, 8% despite that relative – if I can sort of – reduction in the longevity of your install base. Can you give us sort of any feeling, Tony, just in terms of, I don't know, scaling up in some way sort of – maybe dollar value isn't particularly helpful. But just kind of help us think about the relative scale of the young install base in terms of, I don't know, units or anything that can help us to understand how much potentially sort of pent-up future revenue there is as those young units start to mature into middle age. </p>
<p class="p p16"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p16">Just to pick the first one off, on smart support, directionally, our aftermarket in civil last year, about £716 million in 2019, and we showed you the value of those multi-year, smart support contracts, about £150 million last year. And obviously, that's grown with the additional contracts. And they spread over a period of three to four years. So, you can sort of work out from that that we're heading towards 10% -- not quite there yet of the total – is a good proxy. And we expect to see, as more smart support deals get signed, that it will be an increasingly important part of the total aftermarket sales of the group. We'll never completely flip to smart support, but I would expect you to see it to grow. And not only is it growing as a percentage of the total, but it's also growing the market share, which is the important point. You'll recall a graph that we showed last time at year end, about 50% of our addressable market being captured today. Nobody captures it all because of the military and other areas, you're using bases and some airlines choose to do their own maintenance labor. But we can expect to see that move up from 50%, up towards about 70%. And the combination of the two will increasingly make it a more significant slice of our total aftermarket. So, hopefully, that gives you a frame for that. </p>
<p class="p p16">On defense, quarter two, you're right. Very strong comp. We had an extraordinary year last year. To be declaring the sort of growth that we got in quarter one was a phenomenal performance, slightly softer performance in quarter two, again, largely against the comp of last year, Harry. But nothing to report there really in terms of – we're still pretty much tracking in line with our expected outlook in defense and it remains very robust. </p>
<p class="p p16">And as far as the naught to 10-year old fleet, I guess there's 10 ways to just slice that. It's actually sliced on the chart in revenue terms rather than number of aircraft. And as a proxy for you to work through and estimate aftermarket, I thought that was probably the most helpful, certainly something we pay a lot of attention to. Over time, we'll seek to try and give you more color on that. But I think for the purpose, this is the first time we've disclosed that sort of split, and it's in the intent to try and be more helpful, so that you can model what is an annuity that, whilst near term lots of uncertainties, that absolutely will grow as you start to move out over the next two, three years. </p>

<p class="p p17">Our next question comes from Chris Leonard at Credit Suisse. </p>
<p class="p p17"><strong><span class="question">Christopher Leonard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p17">Just two quick questions from me please. Looking, again, at the sort of customer inventory position. Just wondering if you guys saw any destocking behavior during Q2 for the civil aftermarket and perhaps maybe that impacted at the start of Q3. </p>
<p class="p p17">And then, second question, just thinking of regional airline failures in the US recently as an effect of COVID and whether or not you have seen any potential impact from that to your regional jet aftermarket. Thanks.</p>
<p class="p p17"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p17">Just on destocking, the answer is yes, we did start to see it. I guess I'm reassured by the fact that, having been through different crises, clearly nothing quite as dramatic and as fast as we've seen on this one, but we've been surprised. The airlines today actually do a much better job at managing their stock levels and their spare parts inventories than they were doing, say, 10 years ago where they had a lot of parts on the shelf. So, they were clearly destocking in quarter two, and we think that will continue in quarter three. Depends on the airline. </p>
<p class="p p17">But there's a lot less inventory out there on the shelf than there was 10 years ago. So, actually, as the market starts to recover and those aircraft start to fly, the more important metric is tracking how much of the fleet is actually active. </p>
<p class="p p17">So, as you start to see a bigger proportion of that fleet going into active, that's where we expect the aftermarket will come back somewhat faster than we've seen in previous crises. But definitely seeing destocking in quarter two and quarter three.</p>
<p class="p p17">As far as regional airline failures go, we track that pretty closely at the airline level. We're managing it today. It's the regional fleet. When you look at the numbers, we've been very transparent on one of the slides. They're down slightly more than we're seeing in large jets. That's largely because even though the domestic recovery around the world is coming first, it's been led by China, and China doesn't really use regional jets. They're using narrowbodies and widebodies. So, it's the European and American markets where most of the world's regional jet fleet lives and that's still pretty depressed. So, that's why we're seeing slightly further down on regional jets. Again, that will all work its way through as the market recovers. And obviously, once we get through this near-term period of COVID spikes and such like, that will still be the type of aircraft that benefits first.</p>
<p class="p p17">I don't know if you want to add anything.</p>
<p class="p p17"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p17">No. Just from a receivables perspective, our 90-day plus position has remained relatively stable. We've had a bit of noise in the beginning. Surprisingly, little exposure to some of the private and regional airlines, but clearly closely watching it in our weekly calls. So, yeah, nothing, nothing to add apart from that. </p>

<p class="p p17">Our last question today comes from David Perry at JPMorgan. </p>
<p class="p p17"><strong><span class="question">David Perry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p17">I just had three quick questions. One is, I know you're not giving guidance. But I just wanted to ask you this. If I look at the consensus on Bloomberg, it implies a decent step up in the margin in the second half. I think it implies about 16%. Just wondered how you felt about that. </p>
<p class="p p17">And the second one was, and you may not want to comment, but let me try, any sort of color on Q1 versus Q2 in terms of profitability? I'll just leave it at that.</p>
<p class="p p17">And then, the third one is, in the last couple of years, you've had a nice step up in absolute terms in defense sales in H2. Do you think that's still possible this year? Thanks.</p>
<p class="p p17"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p17">So, all very fair questions and quite challenging, I think, given we're holding guidance until that 10th of November update, I think. But as far as consensus is concerned, we completely accept that consensus is based on quite a wide range of estimates at the moment, and hopefully some of the clarity we've given today and the confirmation of the first half enables people to take that into their models and reassess. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p18">As far as margin increase in the second half, that is the big question, really, David, in terms of exactly what does the recovery in civil aerospace look like. We've had, as I've said, I'm sort of repeating myself, four challenging months, probably five. By the time everybody starts to analyze what's happened in August, the news flow is suggesting that that's going to continue. We've certainly got a first half with the benefit of one very strong quarter. We really weren't dropping off until the last 10 days of March. So, we've got a pretty strong opening back to the year. Very challenging to repeat that sort of performance in the second half. So, I don't think I'd be any more specific than that. I don't know, Louisa, if there's anything else from your side.</p>
<p class="p p18"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p18">You asked if we were comfortable with it. I don't want to get drawn into giving guidance because the whole point of this is that it's very difficult to predict. But there's a size angle here in terms of the civil aftermarket. I've already sort of said, we don't know whether we're in high, low, low, low or high, low, low progressive, but we've also got some questions over the profitability in the second half. What's the mix? We traditionally – again, I'm repeating myself – had that really big tick up in Q4, which I don't think Tony and I believe is going to be as big in 2020, which gives us quite a lot of margin accretion. So, I think – and FX. Adverse FX potentially with the weakening of the dollar is also something that's on my mind. So, those are just some of the things that the finance director is thinking about that perhaps would question some of that margin in the second half. </p>
<p class="p p18"><strong><span class="answer">Tony Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p18">And I'll add to that one thing that the CEO is tracking quite closely, as well as the CFO, and that is that we're not through the COVID pandemic yet, particularly in the United States. We've got large plants. We've had as a company about 50 confirmed infections. We're probably investigating another 30 or so at any point in time. 30 of that 50 were in one of our largest plants down in Georgia, Atlanta. So, until the whole running of the business starts to stabilize, then that puts a headwind on – we've got great confidence in the £400 million to £450 million. We've tested at the edge of the envelope where we think our liquidity and headroom should be based on some very sensible models, we think. But still a lot to do. But we will certainly give you more color on that, David, when we report in November. </p>
<p class="p p18"><strong><span class="answer">Louisa Burdett</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p18">You asked about Q1, Q2 profitability. I think we'll probably just give you the generic that clearly Q2 was quite difficult, loss of revenue. It was an action quarter when we were trying to put our plans in place. And as I mentioned I think on my first slide, we were running at a pretty full run rate on most of the costs until the back end of that quarter. So, directionally, obviously, Q2 profitability would have been impacted.</p>
<p class="p p18">And H2 defense, the framework for our full year includes a robust assumption around defense. Tony's given quite a lot of color on what we've been seeing. So, obviously, it's a good underpin to whatever our out-term will be. And we will be looking to maximize our opportunities in that end market. </p>
