<p class="p p1"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Sean Meakim, Oil Services Analyst at JP Morgan. Thanks everyone for joining us this fireside chat with the executive team from Dril-Quip on the back of their 2Q results that were released last night. In addition to the release, the company has a slide deck available on their website, so be sure to check that out.</p>
<p class="p p1">Joining me today is CEO of Dril-Quip, Blake DeBerry; and recently appointed CFO, Raj Kumar. Blake is with the company 32 years now, including last nine or so as CEO, he is also a Director on the Board. Now I'll come back to Blake's background in a second, but first I wanted to introduce Raj. Raj is 10 years bit shorter than Blake, having joined about 3 years ago from Frank's; taking over the CFO role just in May when prior CFO, Jeff Bird, was appointed President and COO. Raj followed in Jeff's footsteps from Frank's to Dril-Quip, but interestingly, he has a pretty diverse industry background which is a relative rarity for oil services in my experience.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, gentlemen great to be here. Thank you for joining us.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thanks, Sean. Delighted.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Raj Kumar</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Well look, let's just come to the table at the start. You reported second quarter results last night, we'll come back to that in a bit, but to open things up, I wanted to maybe just to take a step back. I mentioned I'll come back to Blake's background. Blake you were appointed CEO in my first few months covering the space back in 2011. So you're not going always back now, but in my time covering the Company, it's always struck me that your background in R&amp;D has given you a pretty unique perspective on how to make the most of what's been now a challenging half-decade or so relatively weak offshore activity. So to kick things off, could you just talk about the underlying thesis that's guided how you position the company here in terms of new product development and how you've been able to compete against what are ultimately much larger competitors?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Certainly. So -- you're right, Sean, I spent my first 13 years at Dril-Quip in R&amp;D, doing new product development and that's the weight heavy on my background. When I became CEO in October of 2011, I spent a lot of time looking at what -- what were the -- what were the products that Dril-Quip was successful and what ones they weren't in and it became clear to me that where we had a differentiated technology that was where we excelled in that. That really was in some of the core products right out of the gate of the connectors and the subsea wellhead primarily. And then when you look at SPS space in trees, we had kind of and also ran product, it was the same as what other people had and so it's more difficult to penetrate. So and clearly that we had to create some differentiation.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">In '12, we were coming off of Macondo, our customers were demanding much more qualification testing. So we really took a strategy products and we went back to our core products and started doing additional testing on those to meet customer requirements. But when the downturn in late '14, early '15 came, I really challenged our R&amp;D team and said, look, I want you to design products that structurally change how our customers drill wells, to provide them permanent cost savings, because my view is, this industry is going to come back and when it comes back we're going to -- we're going to see that cost inflation happen, rig rates are going to go back up, everything is going to go up.</p>
<p class="p p2">And so if we can save our customers money in the form of -- I don't have to install a piece of equipment, but I also save them time. And time is an incredibly valuable commodity to our customers and particularly as cost goes up, if you save time you're actually saving more money for them. With respect to the competing with the larger peers, really Dril-Quip was built on foundation of innovation, quality and service and that was really from the three founders, Larry Reimert, Gary Smith and Mike Walker. And we've maintained that all along. We're a little bit smaller company, we're much more nimble, so we can move quickly when our customers change. And we've got -- we've got dedicated employees really around the globe servicing our customers. And then on the technology side, we have some competitors that work with us right now, on the down tool space, we work with one of our peers down in Ecuador, they subcontract and work to us.</p>
<p class="p p2">And most recently to be honest, the VXTe, the new subsea tree we came out with has had a lot of -- lot of interest and we're looking at where -- how we can monetize that technology. And so we're looking at -- we got a couple of our peers that we're talking to about -- about that technology and how we can supply that to them and give them the advantage of that technology about spending money on R&amp;D and developing it. And we are a manufacturer, so our view is we want to manufacture components for you to give you the benefits of our technology.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, thanks for that, Blake. I think that really that kind of -- certain table well, because a number of topics that you touched on we're going to go through in more detail throughout the call. Let me turn over to Raj for a second. So similar question for you. You came over more or less of Jeff about three years ago. DRQ is pretty regarded as a pretty well run offshore equipment manufacturer within the oil services space, but in my experience covering the group I found that folks with backgrounds outside of the industry are often able to bring new perspectives, new KPIs and new fresh-thinking around how to enhance performance. And since Jeff has joined, it's appeared to us that Blake and Jeff had a pretty good effective partnership. Of course, you were a big part of those initiatives and now you're taking on the CFO mantle. So, the head start the company had in terms of lean initiatives has clearly served you well into this latest downturn. So we'll go into some of the granularities over time, but just at a high level, can you catch us up on what that work is looked like since you joined the company, some of those key initiatives and where you think is there still a lot of room to run?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Raj Kumar</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Sean. So, I consider myself as insider and outsider, I have been in the actually for about 12 years. Before coming to the oilfield, I was -- I worked in technology. So absolutely bring that perspective I was at Dell, a company that was very focused on cost leverage and cash conversion cycle, euphemism for working capital management. I have been working with Jeff for the past six years, so we have -- I'm going to say we have a very similar DNA. And he and I worked on together with Blake. We worked on key initiatives over the past three years at Dril-Quip. We've talked about the 2019 transformation -- the initial set up of the footprint rationalization, all of which I was involved with as part of the team, both in terms of the planning, as well as the execution.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">Yes. If I would flip and think about what the focus areas are going to be going forward, there's going to be a lot of focus on capital allocation, with a strong emphasis on working capital management. We're going to continue the cost leverage initiatives that we are always focused on, as well as the -- there are some improvements that we can make probably on the IT side, that's going to be a main focus for me in this role. So that's going to be the areas that I'm going to be looking to.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Appreciate that. I think that's good. So now we kind of set the table, we should probably dig into 2Q results a little bit. Overall, things are pretty in line with expectations, your top line little better than consensus, EBITDA pretty in line, maybe always a bit of a struggle, but we'll go through that. It was an exceptionally challenging quarter for the sector and for the overall economy. So maybe I should start with the COVID impact. Can you just talk a little bit about how the business was impacted what you've been able to do to mitigate to the tree, just given what we've heard across the industry I imagine, the service thing was more challenged than products, but both sides wouldn't come [indiscernible] maybe just give us -- well to start with those impacts and we can take it from there?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Sure, Sean. When -- there is really kind of mid-March, early March we instituted our business continuity plan which was anybody who could work from home -- work from home and our IT group did an incredible job in a very short period of time, getting 700 people working from home and maintaining connectivity. And then our essential employees that are required to come into the office and that's really our manufacturing personnel and aftermarket, the assembly folks and all the fabrication that we do. Those people came in and we then -- part of that business continuity plan was we separated the ships out, we shifted the working hours. There was no typical handover where one machine as we're talking the other here -- on this part, there was none of that. We stopped 15 minutes prior to end of the shift to do -- do a cleaning of all the touch points.</p>
<p class="p p3">And so the end result of that is, you just don't get as much production output, it's really an hour's game. We just don't have people working the same number of hours and that has continued on through the second quarter and it's been impacted in different ways. We're still doing our business continuity plan in the UK, in Singapore. The Singapore government actually came to us at one point when they hit their circuit breaker and said how many people do you have working and then told us what the new number of people that we were had working with us right.</p>
<p class="p p3">And we dropped some headcount there. And in Houston, we are now back to normal shift patterns and working overtime. But -- but we do have occasions where we get an exposure to COVID and we did have one of those instances that happened in our assembly area for example, where we can't have social distancing, you got big heavy parts, multiple people working on assembling things. And we had an -- one employee who had an exposure and came into the office, found out the exposure was after he had come to work. And so we ended up having to shut down and quarantine our assembly folks for 10 or 12 days. And so that's just lost hours, right, in production. And so that's the kind of things that we've highlighted in the investor deck, showing the impacts of this virus.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, appreciate that, Blake. I think getting some of that the anecdotes and the day-to-day realities of except now or scheme, I think that's helpful context. So let's talk about the transformation program a bit. There is an update in the slides, $11.5 million of cost out is what you've accomplished to date. The target now is another $9 million for the back half of the year, maybe more front-end loaded in the third quarter.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">Let's just talk about maybe progress and plans as we look towards the back half and next year.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. Sure, Sean. So we embarked on the planning for the $20 million cost takeout in Q1. We executed in Q2 $11.5 million as you mentioned. This came primarily from the US, coming from Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. Now, as we look forward into Q3 and Q4, our focus is going to be Europe, where we are consolidating the tree COE into Houston, and it's going to take us probably the most of Q3 as we work through the backlog in the tree COE, the current COE that we have in Aberdeen, and by the end of the year, we should be done with the consolidation of the tree COE, but that would be Aberdeen will now be left with all of the pipe fabrication, testing assembly, and the aftermarket activity. So, we will still have a presence in Aberdeen except that the three CEO will now be located in Houston. And that should result in the remaining $9 million of savings that we are targeting for the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it. That's really helpful. And then, one other thing that was interesting in the slides, a new slide emphasizing this -- emphasis on shrinking your roof line, your footprint, but there's been no shortage of that across is early season with stocks have been announcing facility closures, et cetera. But what you're seeing a bit unique was that you're not exiting leases and paying cash out, you're looking to monetize real estate assets and harvesting cash. If you could just highlight that, it's pretty interesting to me.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. Yes. So, if you recall in 2019, we went through what I would deem quite a big transformation, where we realized slightly over $50 million in cost savings and a part of that was rationalization of our global operating footprint and that was around a 30% reduction in footprint. This is actually the outcome of that whole initiative with the adoption of our lean operating philosophy, this enabled us to leverage our footprint and what you're seeing right now, Sean, is we're just going out to monetize this excess roof line that we have. You talked about leases. Evidently, we don't have any material leases to speak off, and in terms of manufacturing facilities, we own most of this facility. So that's the only way for us to realize the cash as far as to go ahead and monetize it.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it. Yes, I think that's certainly different from most what we heard from the others this quarter. So let's talk about the order rate. You booked only about $40 million in the quarter. I'm sure it's a little disappointing you're targeting maybe 50 to 60 per quarter. But then again, considering customers literally couldn't come to their offices, I don't know that we're going to follow you through a challenging 2Q in terms of inbound. Maybe just refresh for folks, how your comfort level around the $200 million bogie for the full year.</p>
<p class="p p4">I'd just like to hear generally what your visibility looks like versus maybe where you were three months ago, having a sort of discussion.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Certainly -- so yes, certainly $40 million was below our initial expectation for the quarter in bookings and in fact we were significantly above the $40 billion number as we entered the quarter, but what we really saw was things pushed to the right. We didn't lose any orders, but we did see our customers hit the pause button, given the uncertainty in the economy and the market, which we certainly understand.</p>
<p class="p p4">So our view is the work is still out there. The potential is still there, but the decisions just weren't made in the second quarter and they push that decision down to Q3 or Q4. And so that helps us with the outlook for the year on the $200 million bogey for the full year. And to be honest, our frequency of contact with our customers has remained steady, not so much face to face, but certainly virtual contact. We have a few customers who -- they are at office, and so we get face to face with them; so we haven't just seen a whole lot of difference. With respect to three months ago and now, there still seems to be a fair level of uncertainty and one thing that I think is a little bit different, you've seen all of our customer base cut their CapEx budgets for the year, and so, internally there is this competition for that capital allocation, which project is going to get that capital allocation, and so, I think that's where we are customers still deciding where they're going to deploy that reduced capital.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">The other thing is you know from a tree standpoint, that's probably an area where we have the biggest disappointment. The independents just cut their plans quickly. To be honest, when we entered the year, we were tracking, I think 32 potential subsea trees with and we thought we would book 15 and that stuff just vaporized almost instantly when this virus hit and the demand dropped and the price of oil dropped, because the independents reacted pretty quickly.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Right. Yes, we'll talk more about that as well. I think that's an important dynamic. So let's just dig in the results a little bit more just to provide some more context. As I mentioned, top line margin pretty in line curious to your thoughts in the back half of the year. Street modeling with a modest revenue decline, but flat to up EBITDA, so is there any more cost out that's consistent with what Raj laid out earlier. Just how are you are seeing the P&amp;L for the back half of the year?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So, revenue expectations should be value unchanged. I mean, if you look at first half, I think, you're going to see that trend sort of continue into the second half. In terms of EBITDA and margin, yes, you're absolutely right. We should see the cost takeout start to be seen in Q3 and Q4, as we progress piece. However, on the services side, we do expect some headwinds given COVID restrictions and challenges related to COVID, where our service technician personnel may have interruptions in terms of executing to work with travel restrictions. And this is going to have a bearing on service revenue and service revenue tends to have a higher margin in terms of mix. And I see that being a headwind going into the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So, I -- just to kind of put a button on that. Are services more challenged in terms of just getting worked out with more COVID impact and hope that tends to be the higher-margin business, but you also have the highest coming out and that's -- maybe you just talk a little bit about how you distinguish between mix from a gross margin perspective, and then, how we think about the cost savings as well on an EBITDA basis, what's kind of the end result. How should we think about that blend?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So, if you think about it, fair assumption to make is the cost take-out is going to be -- part of it is going to be gross margin level and the other part is going to be SG&amp;A. And if you think about the service revenue and the impact of headwind we're going to see that, that's going to be an impact to the gross margin, because that's going to be a top-line hit from a service perspective. So, if I'm looking out second half of the year depending on how services and activities payout, and at this juncture, it's hard to say, because rig delays accompanying that's ongoing, sometimes it works in our favor. Like in this quarter, we saw instances where our service technicians were quarantining and we were able to make sure that they were compensated adequately for that, but that phenomena may or may not continue going into the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="p p5">So, if I'm looking at margins going forward, the impact of the cost takeout should help mitigate the negative impact that we're expecting from the service margin loss.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Got it, yes. I think that's helpful. I appreciate you provided a framework. So the balance sheet is still pristine. As I'm sure you're well aware, breakeven on free cash in the quarter is not as big sequential improvement, probably some restructuring costs are dragging that number a little bit. Working capital generally helpful on seasonality. So good progress, but the cash balance stands about $345 million. So these are wood to chop in the back half to get back to that $415 million watermark that you had set out to start 2020. May be just can you walk through anything that you think is worth calling out in the quarter and then expectations for the back half towards keeping that cash flow neutrality target?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. Sure, Sean. So, Q2 collection was a good collections quarter for us. We collected close to $100 million. And the focus on collections is going to continue. You think about where we had some build it was inventory, right? And that a lot of that was COVID-related, but we had COVID-related inventory delay that had headwind to working capital in Q2. Some of the inventory was also build related to strategic stocking for our downhole tools business, and this is when we go into the second half of the year, you're going to see that the downhole tools business continues to show resiliency, and we wanted to make sure that we had the relevant inventory support for that. Going forward, I expect -- well extended in the payment terms to be more favorable and speaking about lean and that sort of philosophy, we've implemented some lean techniques in the way we do our invoicing, and we've reduced our invoicing turnaround time, and we continue to make improvements there and that's going to help in our collections due.</p>
<p class="p p6">On the inventory side, I'm going to say that right now it's a bit of an area where we need to be managing it, but COVID seems to be an area that we need to be watching, because that's causing some delays and you need to have the right amount of inventory support to meet market demand. And going into the second half, we will see some help from a tax refund related to the tariffs there and that's going to help us too, I'm still confident in building to that $400 million target that we had in terms of cash neutrality given all of these factors that we're working on.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Got it. And so, you mentioned a lot of initiatives. So going into the pandemic, you were already targeting a pretty robust unlocking of cash out of your working capital on the balance sheet. These went through a lot of issues were already underway. It seems pretty ambitious to start, but again there was -- it seems like there's a lot of value to unlock, it gets a lot harder in an environment like this to affect a lot of the things, it gets tougher to make cautions as you said inventory committee [indiscernible] for some period.</p>
<p class="p p6">Do you have any update in terms of how you think about those long-term targets and achieving them, considering perhaps things will be -- there is a little bit tougher road here in the next couple of quarters?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Raj Kumar</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. So the mantra that I have is we can only control what we can control. So the ability to invoice at a much compressed frequency is going to help roughly, And that's something we control. The ability to go out at more favorable terms with our vendor is something we can control. So that's what we're going to pursue. In terms of projects, yes, at the beginning of the year, you will recall that I talked about increasing milestone frequency and that's probably going to be a challenge in this environment. However, we're not going to not ask, you know, if we are still going to ask our customers for support, because at the end of the day, we have a working capital target and we have a business to sort of run rate. So it's going to be important areas for us to focus on, and while I am not as confident that we will get as many milestone payments as we were targeting. I'm confident that we will get some.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Right. Now, I think very fair to me. I want to make sure we touch base on the Proserv agreement that was kind of the big highlight in the quarter, maybe I guess that the start will be great to hear the rationale for this collaboration. Yes, from a customer perspective as well as from a DRQ perspective, of course, maybe it's not a direct savings, but it sounds like it eliminates the need for some future organic R&amp;D that was kind of on the horizon. So can we just walk through some of that.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Raj Kumar</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Certainly, Sean. Look, I think just to make clear, we have a subsea controls business, which the company has had for quite some time and it was relatively low penetration in market share, but it had reached a point that that business required some R&amp;D spend in order to get the technology up to the current technology and be competitive in the market, and we were planning to spend overall in controls the additional R&amp;D plus just the headcount and overheads for that controls group was somewhere between $8 million and $10 million a year that we were going to carry.</p>
<p class="p p7">And so, we were looking for alternatives given the low market share, and when we saw the downturn in the market, quite honestly it was just a good capital allocation decision, because we would invest a substantial amount of mind to get our controls up to speed, but then, we would see the return on that capital was moving further out just because we're waiting for a foreign market to recover. So that was the reason that we reached out to Proserv. I've had a relationship with the Proserv folks. We would sit down usually twice a year, just visit and try and because we have trees and they had controls. They were always trying to -- we're trying to leverage each other's customer base. And so, it just seem to make sense we reached out to them, they have excellent technology in the control space and they've taken over our -- the bulk of our -- some of our controls backlogs. We were finishing out a few things, but they're taken longer-term stuff and no bating contracts to Proserv and that allowed us to just remove that one, the R&amp;D spend out, but also the cost of the personnel in the overhead out of our business.</p>
<p class="p p7">We viewed that transaction as a win-win collaboration, it's good for Proserv, it's good for Dril-Quip. We get access to do a very latest technology in controls. But few of us together also get access to each other's customer base. So we're now pulling them then with -- when we're selling trees, we're pulling projects with our personnel and to sell the control and vice versa, and they're bringing us into -- for opportunities where they're selling controls, where we can bring the trees in. So I think it's going to be a win-win for us like I said, and actually the feedback we're getting from customers is mostly positive. It was a good outcome for everyone who were in.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Any early anecdotes on the customer side, and it's still early days here, but anything else you can share on that front?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I think from our customer base, most of them said, hey, this is a good solution for Dril-Quip and for Proserv. We're happy to add Proserv come in there. Proserv is actually going to take over some of the maintenance of Dril-Quip legacy controls in the field. And so, like I said, I think we're in the early stages. So we're now bidding something that we weren't bidding before, but our teams are collaborating regularly. And so, I think it's going to be a positive move we're really doing.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I appreciate that. Let's maybe spend most rest of our time looking forward. Next quarter, third quarter looks pretty challenging. Global economy is going to try to recover to something approximating pre-COVID levels. It doesn't look like there's going to be a significant call on the upstream let alone for offshore barrels. We're now, OPEC will be engaged in this delicate dance of adding barrels back in the market without hopefully being too disruptive to get price. But if you look beyond that period, there should be eventually a call on the upstream again. Last cycle -- Shell's with the vast majority of the market share of that incremental call on the upstream. The offshore complex has done a lot of them to improve its economics, shorten cycle times, so first if we just talk about the next one to two years, Blake, what's your outlook for the market and DRQ's order potential? I noticed in the slide deck, your assumption has got a little better from last quarter, but it's really not out to like 2023, largely pretty unchanged view, a lot can happen between now and then. Just, what's your feel about the next few quarters?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. Just -- Sean, the next few quarters, given the [Technical Difficulty] there is no doubt it's going to remain challenging. And we really believe it's looking like 2022 or 2023 before the collection in the offshore sector. I just like our position is we're in a good spot with the new products that we have and with our balance sheet and our backlog and I think we're be able to ride the storm out.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">No, that's right. Yes. Certainly, a tough market. We spoke about this earlier but not too much detail. Not every operator is acting in lockstep. You already mentioned a little bit of tougher time for the independents out of the gate here. Just maybe, can you talk about how you're seeing behavior between IOCs, NOC's, and independents? And how that's impacting your business?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Sure. Yes. So, there is a stark difference between those three, and particularly, the independents rate. Like any other business, it's probably a balance sheet related again, right. So, the independents reacted quickly and dramatically, cutting CapEx and I think we have a slide in the investor deck showing the level of CapEx cut in the independents and it was substantially higher than both IOCs and NOCs, and the IOCs also has done a cut in their CapEx, but I don't think they've cut their CapEx budget, but I don't think they said where that spend is coming from. So we're still in a discussion phase where they can push this delivering out of it. I won't bring this [indiscernible]; so their activity level is dropping. But we don't know exactly which way it's going to go.</p>
<p class="p p8">On the NOCs, it's an interesting dynamic. I think it depends, are you a net oil importer or exporter. We've seen the likes of CNOOC, for example, they've actually accelerated some of their drilling campaigns because for them, this is a key time to drill and if they can bring in domestically, they'd rather do that. Petrobras also, while not accelerating, but they certainly did that decelerate as much as a lot of the IOCs and so we've had a strong work from Petrobras. And in fact, they're still on track to bid a 70 wellhead tender towards the end of this year.</p>

<p class="p p8">[Technical Difficulty] go round out the rest of the geography. So for you, Brazil is still relatively constructive, it sounds like Asia generally not as bad. North-East is probably still doing okay, right. We've got some tailwinds there that are bit idiosyncratic. To be honest, probably still quite constructive. So you got some pockets there that you can really hang your head on. In some other areas, Gulf of Mexico has probably seemed a little more challenged; West Africa, certainly, in which we just kind of walk around the rest of the world and how do you see things?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. So you're right. So, Asia has been -- and I'm going to call it a bright spot, but it's a glowing ember on a candle, right? I mean it's brighter than the rest, but there seems to be a [ph]leverage to that, I think some of the gas plays in the LNG stuff is still moving forward. We're seeing currently woodside still talking about doing a development in Myanmar, which is a gas development, I spoke about CNOOC accelerating. The North Sea has been okay as well. We have seen pretty steady work in the North Sea. The Gulf of Mexico definitely is the biggest hit. I think a lot of that pie effect to the independents, they were becoming pretty active. I mean beyond that, we don't do a lot of work there. We are pursuing some work and pending some work in Indiana, but we're not a major contributor.</p>
<p class="p p8">We are although providing drill wells in Suriname, so I think you know who that is, and recently we've seen an uptick in Mexico in our downhole tools business as well as in Ecuador, and to be honest, overall that downhole tool business has been pretty resilient. I mean it's going to be flat year-on-year, which has -- given the circumstances, that's actually like being up.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">That's right. Yes, flatter than Europe. Well, thanks for that. So, then let's look beyond the next few quarters. At some point, the world gets back to some form of normality. And I'm curious to hear your outlook on offshore getting a bigger seat at the table next cycle. So just to put some parameters around [Technical Difficulty] subsea trees or proxy, the market average 370 trees from 2010 and 2014, the peak of about 550 in 2013, the cycle 2015-2019 is a little over 200 trees, so down about 45%, and the peak was a little over at 318, trough below 116. So that's kind of where we've been. Just curious on what beyond the next couple of years, where do you see activity cycle over cycle for offshore?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes, so it's interesting. You know, I think the US land unconventional definitely took a large portion of the capital and the marginal barrels in the space and probably reduce the importance of offshore some, but what we're seeing now with the calls for capital discipline in these Shell-based companies. I'm not sure it's going to come back and be as big players before. I think those people, they are in good rock. We will continue to work and produce, but the capital discipline is going to limit some of the others from kind of back and getting that production that high. So the option for that is, we're pretty bullish in the longer term on offshore globally. I think we're going to get a bigger seat at that table if our view on the unconventionals plays out as I described.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Well, fair enough. And so, one important area for Dril-Quip we haven't touched enough on yet is new product introductions and customer adoption. So, it's a big initiative. We discussed this at the top right, you put a lot of time and energy into bringing products to market if you need value propositions. But let me get kind of latest feedback, customer acceptance, qualification, installations, things like that, we'd like to call out in debt. The [indiscernible] well had VXTe connector, the double expansion Liner Hanger, and then certainly the VXTe, we are down at your R&amp;D ability for our technology to or not too long ago, pre-pandemic obviously, and that was really the most exciting thing we've learned about on that tour. OTC spotlight awards, that's very kind deal, you have a couple of years. We just get maybe an update from around the horn on those. I think that'll be really helpful.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. So, it's just talking about those products more broadly. We just call it the E-Series of products. I think it goes back to when I said, I challenged our R&amp;D teams. I wanted to develop products that structurally change how our customers drill wells for permanent cost savings, and that's the outcome of that challenge as those products we just announced. All of them either save direct dollars from not having to run equivalent or same time, which is time-is-money or they eliminate risk. And so, all of those banks are important to our customer base, and you're right. We've been recognized by OTC, all those products did receive a spotlight on new technology award. Interestingly, our strategy has always been to reach out to be independents, get the new products run by the independents, prove, get that serial number one hurdle behind us. And this downturn has made that challenging, but because of the cost savings, and if these products we're estimating about $5 million per well, if you use the whole Sweden products, which is pretty significant cost reduction.</p>
<p class="p p9">We are actually getting some pickup from majors looking at the new products. So we're working with Chevron on BigBore-IIe, we're working with Shell on the double expansion Liner Hanger, VXTe is Chevron's looking at that. And so the independents have been challenging because they cut their budget so substantially, but it's not all downside, there is still some upside. We did install our first horizontal tree last week successfully. So that's good news and I appreciate the good work that our team had done to get to that point. And our first VXTe is still on schedule to be installed in Q4 2020 or Q4 2021. So we're still going to make some penetration. I think it's just a little bit slower than what we had hoped and that's just really more market driven.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes. And it's absolutely fair. Also as we're kind of wrapping up a bit here, the other major point is to talk around capital [Technical Difficulty].</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Hello?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">I'm sorry. Sean actually just got disconnected. Let me go ahead and check for his line. Excuse me, speakers. I'm sorry, I'm still unable to see his line on the main conference [Technical Difficulty] just a moment.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Blake, are you there?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes, Sean is connected now. Thank you, speakers.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes. Welcome back, Sean.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Well, I'm back. But obviously, this is work-from-home, I don't think is fine.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes, Sean.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Sorry for that.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">It happened to earlier on the call.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes, so just as we kind of winding down the call here, just wanted to talk a little bit about capital allocation.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Raj Kumar</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes, so I can go through and very quickly give you a rundown of -- to your point $350 million of cash right now. If you think about CapEx is going to be in the near term, it's going to be maintenance level, say $12 million to $15 million. R&amp;D is probably going to be in the, I would say, $15 million to $20 million rates given the recent closer collaboration is going to help us avoid some of the R&amp;D costs related to controls, which is quite sizable. And then, we always set aside some cash to support any potential upturn as you know and you mentioned earlier, lower project-based business. So at the initial quite of any up and there is going to be some build in working capital, that we will need to address.</p>
<p class="p p10">We do keep satisfying some from cash as a dry powder for any potential M&amp;A. However, if you look at the industry right now, if you need a severe consol -- if you need of consolidation, right. And anything that we would want to do, our cash levels are not going to be sufficient to fully funded. So that's going to be a bit more creative in the different forms of currency to go ahead and do an M&amp;A transaction. But as you have M&amp;A, you need to have a willing buyer and a willing seller. So, we'll have to see how this market pans out over the next couple of years. Whatever we do in terms of M&amp;A is going to have to be something that consolidates and how [ph]meaningful market share and we will be very focused to ensure that the business that's required is able to generate free cash flow and we're not taking a lot of business that's going to be conserving cash for the near term at least. We are quite focused, we make sure that through integration, we will be able to very quickly make it a cash flow generating business soon.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Great. Well, technical issues aside, I think this is a pretty constructive discussion. So I think I am just done it for my questions. This as we wrap up and we're getting close to noon on a summer Friday in the East, so gentlemen, any concluding remarks or key messages, if you'd like to leave us as the weekend beckons.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Blake DeBerry</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes, Sean. I would just first like to recognize all the employees at Dril-Quip have done an incredible job, adapting to this pandemic and given the essential workers are coming in every single day and doing the hard markets of delivering products to our customers, but also the people that are working from home and OTC got canceled, that was a big show, coming-out party for VXTe, our marketing and sales department slipped, and we did PC online virtually, and we actually did 50 online presentations to almost 600 customers, and many major operators that weren't aware of that VXTe product are now aware and we're getting significant traction from them. And we're also getting significant traction on those products from our peer groups, wanting to see if they can leverage our technology and our tree business. So, I'm just really proud of the Dril-Quip organization, and I still believe that we're in a really good spot.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p11">We definitely are going to survive the outcome in this pandemic and downturn, and I think we're going to be a much better company on the other side.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Sean Meakim</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Look, we certainly agree. Blake, Raj again, great to spend some time with you guys today, and thanks everyone for joining us. I'm Sean Meakim of JPMorgan. Everyone have a great weekend. Thank you.</p>
