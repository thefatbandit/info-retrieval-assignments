<p class="p p2">For the quarter ended June 30th, we recorded net realized losses of approximately $27.3 million or $0.35 per share. We recorded net unrealized depreciation of approximately $11.6 million or $0.15 per share. We had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $1.9 million for $0.02 per share for the first fiscal quarter. As of June 30th, the following metrics applied, we note that none of these metrics represented a total return to shareholders. The weighted average yield of our CLO debt investments at current cost was 11.7% up from 11.6% as of March 31st, the weighted average GAAP effective yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 13.4% down from 15.5% as of March 31<sup>st</sup>. The weighted average cash distribution yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 14% down from 20% as of March 31<sup>st</sup>. </p>
<p class="p p2">We note that the cash distribution yields calculated in our CLO equity investments are based on the cash distributions we received or which we were entitled to receive at each respective period end. During the quarter ended June 30th, we made additional CLO investments of approximately $21.4 million and we received $49.7 million from sales and repayments of our CLO investments. On June 30th, our Board of Directors declared monthly six and three quarters cent common stock distributions through December 31st, 2020.

<p class="p p2">Deep?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Deep Maji</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Thank you, Jonathan. During the quarter ended June 30th, the US loan market strengthened versus the quarter ended March 31st, 2020. US loan prices as defined by S&amp;P, LSTA leveraged loan index increased from 82.9% of par as of March 31st to a quarterly high of 91.2% of par on June 10th, before declining to 89.9% of par on June 30th. As we mentioned last quarter, we anticipated that US CLO equity tranche pricing may remain under pressure in the near to medium term due to elevated ratings downgrades specifically to triple C or below rated and increase in loan default, and the prospect for CLO equity cash flow diversion. While CLO equity cashflow diversion risk has increased in the near to medium term the current environment may create opportunities for the CLO managers of the CLO vehicles in which we are invested to reinvest into higher yielding loans at meaningful discounts to par. </p>
<p class="p p2">This may allow these CLO managers to increase their over-collateralization ratios, to provide additional cushion, to mitigate future CLO equity cashflow diversion caused by additional loan defaults and ratings downgrades. In the current market environment we intend to continue to utilize an opportunistic and unconstrained CLO investment strategy across USTA, low debt and equity tranches, looking to maximize our long term total return and as a permanent capital vehicle, we have historically been able to take a longer term view towards our investment strategy. With that. I will turn the call back over to Jonathan.</p>
