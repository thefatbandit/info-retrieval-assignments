<p class="p p1">Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the Husky Energy's Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call and Webcast. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]</p>
<p class="p p1">I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Cuthbertson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Dan Cuthbertson</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Hello and welcome to our second quarter conference call. CEO, Rob Peabody; CFO, Jeff Hart; and other members of our senior management team are here to review our second quarter results and then we will take your questions.</p>
<p class="p p1">Today’s call has forward-looking information and includes non-GAAP measures. The identification of the forward-looking information and non-GAAP measures, the risk factors and assumptions pertaining to the forward-looking information and additional information pertaining to the non-GAAP measures are in this morning's news release and in our annual filings on SEDAR and EDGAR. Unless stated otherwise, all numbers are in Canadian currency and before royalties. We invite you to save your specific modeling questions for our Investor Relations team after the call.</p>
<p class="p p1">Rob will now begin the review.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Rob Peabody</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thanks Dan. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. In the second quarter, we saw the full impact of the demand shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prices and margins were impacted across North America with extreme volatility at times.</p>
<p class="p p1">In light of the deteriorating macro environment, we move swiftly to stabilize the business by matching our cash outflows with our inflows. This will maintain the strength of our balance sheet in what could be an extended low price environment.</p>
<p class="p p1">In the actions we took included cutting 2020 capital spending in half by CAD1.7 billion, targeting about CAD150 million in cost efficiencies, reducing capital spending at the Superior refinery, and in conjunction with the Board, lowering the dividend.</p>
<p class="p p1">With these actions, we were able to reduce our total 2020 projected cash outlays by about CAD2.5 billion compared to the original plan. We also improved our liquidity position with a CAD500 million term loan, ending the second quarter with liquidity of CAD4.6 billion.</p>
<p class="p p1">In addition, we suspended production that was generating negative cash margins and we made full use of our refining, storage, and midstream facilities to avoid selling distressed production.</p>
<p class="p p1">Oil prices are ultimately driven by the demand for refined products and with the integrated corridor business, we had a clear window on end use dynamics. As the COVID-19 related shutdowns began to impact U.S. refined product demand in the first quarter, we adapted our operations by reducing our refinery rates. In tandem, oil production was reduced to remain balanced with the downstream demand pull.</p>
<p class="p p1">We also moved early to draw down our own inventories to create extra space to manage the supply/demand imbalances we could see we're going to emerge. Throughout this period, we have remained disciplined in managing the value chain. The collaboration between the upstream and downstream operations in our integrated quarter, business has been virtually seamless and allowed us to maximize available value capture as market opportunities arose.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">For example, by cutting our production to a low level in the second half of March, we avoided negative heavy crude sales at the very low April contract prices. We then entered May at a low production rate limiting sales at the unfavorable May index price.</p>
<p class="p p2">And as the May spot contract prices improved, we were able to substantially increase production and sell into this rising spot market capturing the widespread between May spot and index pricing.</p>
<p class="p p2">More recently, demand for refining products has been recovering. We've responded accordingly by increasing and optimizing refinery throughput, while also increasing upstream production.</p>
<p class="p p2">We also recently started steaming the 10,000 barrel per day Spruce Lake Central thermal project. First oil is expected later in the third quarter. We'll continue to be disciplined in matching production with refined product demand. Our agility allows us to make ongoing adjustments in response to market and price signals.</p>
<p class="p p2">In this challenging environment, we are maintaining our focus on safety and reliability across our operations. This includes a systematic and controlled approach to safety in all areas of our business, and we remain on track to achieve our key process and occupational safety targets in 2020.</p>
<p class="p p2">Year-to-date, we have recorded a 38% reduction in Tier 1 and 2 process safety events compared to this period in 2019. In 2019, as you'll recall, was a big improvement over 2018. The total recordable injury rate is lower by 31% this year with a 20% reduction in lost-time incidents.</p>
<p class="p p2">Now, looking at the second quarter. In the integrated quarter, approximately 80,000 barrels per day of upstream production was shut in at the start of the second quarter. These were primarily heavy oil barrels in our cold, conventional and thermal segments.</p>
<p class="p p2">With demand for refined products recovering, current production from the integrated corridor businesses around 190,000 barrels per day. Approximately 30,000 barrels a day remain shut-in and the levers are in place to ramp up more in the third quarter, of course dependent on market conditions.</p>
<p class="p p2">Well, throughput volumes at the Lloydminster Upgrader were reduced early in the second quarter, they've since been ramped back up in line with increased demand. And at the Lloydminster Asphalt Refinery, operations remained at full rates over the whole quarter due to strong asphalt pricing.</p>
<p class="p p2">Our U.S. refineries have also returned to higher levels of throughput. Throughput at Lima is in the range of 145,000 to 155,000 barrels a day with utilization at both Lima -- at both the Lima and Toledo refineries at about 85%.</p>
<p class="p p2">We are being cautious not outstrip physical demands and continue to pace our throughput with our product listings. We expect the path forward to be bumpy and will continue to respond rapidly.</p>
<p class="p p2">In the offshore, our average overall net production was 71,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with an operating margin of CAD265 million.</p>
<p class="p p2">In Asia, overall production was 518 million cubic feet per day of natural gas or 246 million cubic feet for Husky's working interest. Associated liquid sales were 23,500 barrels per day, which is just over 11,000 barrels a day net to Husky.</p>
<p class="p p2">Looking forward the 29-1 natural gas field at the Liwan gas project is now mechanically complete. Commissioning work is starting and first production is on schedule for the fourth quarter. Once ramped up, the project will add about 9,000 barrels per day of production net to Husky.</p>
<p class="p p2">Moving to ESG and our ESG initiatives, we plan to release our latest ESG report which will include climate targets next week.</p>
<p class="p p2">Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to review our Q2 numbers.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Jeff Hart</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Thanks Rob. Production in cash flow in the second quarter reflected the severe drop in commodity prices. The shut-in of cash negative production and the deferral of major projects including West White Rose and Superior. Funds from operations were CAD18 million and this included a negative impact from the realization of CAD274 million in after-tax inventory losses that were recorded in our first recorded quarter results, as well as a first-in first-out FIFO after-tax loss of CAD3 million. Cash flow from operating activities, including changes in non-cash working capital was a loss of CAD10 million.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">Net debt at the end of the quarter was CAD5.1 billion, up from CAD4.6 billion in Q1. Importantly, net debt has been stable for the past two months when oil prices and market demand improved. We will prioritize cash towards the balance sheet to reduce net debt levels.</p>
<p class="p p3">Liquidity at the end of the quarter was CAD4.6 billion, which was reinforced by the previously announced CAD500 million term loan in Q2. In addition, Husky has maintained investment-grade credit ratings, S&amp;P recently reaffirmed our BBB rating, and DBRS Morningstar moved Husky to BBB high which is still well within investment-grade parameters.</p>
<p class="p p3">As Rob mentioned, we have now stabilized our business in this low price environment by matching our cash inflows to outflows.</p>
<p class="p p3">CapEx in the second quarter was CAD310 million. This included CAD63 million related to the Superior rebuild, which is expected to be largely covered by property damage insurance.</p>
<p class="p p3">CapEx will be significantly lower for the remainder of the year compared to the first half as major construction is wrapped up at Spruce Lake Central and the 29-1 field at Liwan.</p>
<p class="p p3">As previously announced, the West White Rose project has been suspended. We expect Q3 CapEx to be in the range of CAD400 million to CAD450 million, excluding Superior rebuild costs, with Q4 CapEx between CAD270 million, CAD320 million.</p>
<p class="p p3">Moreover, we have the flexibility should it be required to reduce our annual capital spending to a range of CAD1.2 billion to CAD1.4 billion in 2021, excluding Superior rebuild cost. This is enough to sustain our current downstream throughput capacity of 355,000 barrels a day and hold upstream production at around 260,000 BOE views per day, allowing the lowest margin production to decline.</p>
<p class="p p3">We'll come out with our 2021 guidance in December, but broadly speaking, our capital priorities are focused on our downstream and thermal operations, with about a CAD1 billion earmarked for the integrated quarter. Looking forward, our number one financial priority in the coming months is to maintain the strength of the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="p p3">Additionally, we are continuing to work on lowering operating costs and ongoing sustaining capital requirements and have identified approximately CAD150 million in cost efficiencies to-date.</p>
<p class="p p3">In terms of upcoming turnarounds, the Lloyd Upgrader has -- will begin a scheduled six-week turnaround in Q3, which will include increasing diesel capacity from 6,000 barrels per day to nearly 10,000 barrels a day. And a reminder that this work has been deferred from the second quarter.</p>
<p class="p p3">Tucker will start a four-week turnaround at the end of the third quarter and in the Atlantic region, the Sea Rose is now offline for its regular 15-day maintenance period.</p>
<p class="p p3">Finally, the Board of Directors has approved of dividend of CAD0.125 per common share.</p>
<p class="p p3">Thanks. And now I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p3"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Thank you. We will now begin the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]</p>
<p class="p p3">The first question is from Greg Pardy of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Greg Pardy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. Thanks. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks guys for the rundown. Jeff, I want to come back to the CAD1.2 billion to CAD1.4 billion number and thanks for the -- some clarity there. But I guess the question is, how realistic is this kind of capital number next year.</p>
<p class="p p3">And I hear you in terms of protecting the balance sheet, but obviously, there's also the business to run as you get into 2022. So any color you guys could maybe add around that would be great?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">I'll start and then let Jeff chime in. What I'd say Greg is it's very realistic for next year to operate at those levels. Now, what it does involve is that that covers -- that capital covers all the money we need in the downstream in order to keep all facilities running, stable, well maintained. And then in the upstream, the focus then on the capital would be actually on things like sustaining pads for existing thermal projects.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">One of the advantages we have next year, of course, is that we have finished 29-1 on the -- in China. And in addition, of course, on the production side in terms of supporting production at that sort of capital level, we have bought both 29-1 and Spruce Lake Central that are just coming on stream at that time.</p>
<p class="p p4">So, we've kind of put together the model for that year and it looks like we can -- we could run at that sort of level of capital and with production sustained at close to current levels, a little bit down at around -- say maybe around 260,000 or something barrels a day.</p>
<p class="p p4">And that would take us through 2021 and we think we could also continue to sustain that into 2022. Of course, at some point here, we want to move to a different mode when the environment supports it, which is -- first and foremost, as you know, our first priority is always the balance sheet. So, just maintaining the strong balance sheet and ensuring ourselves that sustainable going forward.</p>
<p class="p p4">And then and then of course, we want to allocate money to restoring what I would call a competitive dividend for our shareholders. And then that then opens the door for additional capital spending that could drive growth in future years again.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Hart</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, great. I think a way to think about that the CAD1.2 billion to CAD1.4 billion is think of it as a call off on capital and think of it in blocks is really the focus there is on -- for lack of better term, the core of the corridor, so you're really maintaining downstream operations doing a sustainable thermal business and then from there, there's decisions. And that's really if you look at it -- like Rob talked about in Asia, where we're at with 29-1 being complete -- mechanically complete. That's really focusing on a sustainable integrated corridor and then from there, there's further decisions. So, yes, it is sustainable.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Greg Pardy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay, so a big chunk of this comes out as a result or capital anyways coming out because you've laid down West White Rose, what would be the earliest that you'd look at resurrecting West White Rose?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, great. So, we have and we continue to have work suspended at West White Rose. Over the course of the third quarter, we're going to be examining the future plans for the project and what our game plan is going to be around it and we'll provide an update when we finish that work.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Greg Pardy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. Just as a follow-up, but switching gears, you guys are adding a 1.5 barrels of storage I guess at Hardesty on year end. Just curious as to whether that's commercial? And then I know you've got another 4.4 million barrels between Hardesty and Lloyd, is all about operating or commercial? I'm just trying to get a sense as to the thinking behind adding the capacity.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. And Greg, I'm assuming you're talking to the projects we referenced in the midstream partnership. And so, really, that's, that's not all just -- that's the -- through the joint venture, it's not all Husky dedicated storage. So, it's -- there's third-party storage as well in there.</p>
<p class="p p4">So, I wouldn't look at it as is all incremental to Husky. With roundabout -- I think it's about half, but I'll go back, but effectively, it's the infrastructure investing, operational storage to support us and third-party commitments.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Greg Pardy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. So, it's operating as opposed to commercial?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">You did -- you can do is -- you can with operational inventory, any storage, obviously, we can make commercial decisions around and optimize.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Greg Pardy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay, okay. And maybe just kind of -- this is a request or just an observation. I know in the last quarter, you'd made the switch in terms of disclosure and so forth. So, here's the request because I can tell you our model is in less than ideal shape right now and the thing we really, really need as we boil through everything has -- is just basically the net back for your bitumen and heavy oil on a dry basis -- dry barrel basis, i.e. not deal bit, it is causing us no lack of frustration to try and get the numbers working. So, anything you guys could do there would be much appreciated.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Absolutely, you take that -- we'll take that. And obviously was a big change, I think for everyone both internally and out in the market to realign to get everything to the corridor and offshore. But as definitely we'll take that feedback.</p>
<p class="p p5">We put some enhancements in this quarter. And we have the information, so we'll take a look at that Greg and make sure we cycle back because we want to make sure that everyone's getting the proper information. So, this is continuous us and we'll continue to continue to move forward.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Greg Pardy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. So if -- and this specifically for 2Q, if we had certain questions around just basic stuff, comments. How much did you get for bitumen, how much did you get for heavy oil? Can we aspire that into IR and get an answer for this quarter?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Absolutely.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Greg Pardy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">You're rock star. Thanks so much. Appreciate it, guys.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">The next question is from Emily Chieng of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Emily Chieng</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Good morning, guys. My first question is just around again, sort of the next couple years of capital; spend outlook and then trying to square that against your 2019 Investor Day five-year growth plan. I know last year and we haven't had the Analyst Day at this year, but CapEx is obviously expected to be in sort of the CAD3 billion plus type of a range. That's now a lot lower. And I think the production goal at the end of the five years then was 400,000 barrels per day.</p>
<p class="p p5">Maybe can you just provide some color as to what's changed between those two data points and is there still the goal to reach that 400 -- or some higher level of production at some point in time?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, thanks. Thanks, Emily. The way I would think about that, again, is, of course, what changed was COVID-19. I think and the look for product demand and of course, oil and gas prices. And Husky's always been a company that is going to prioritize its balance sheet in tough times, because we want to ensure we always maintain our investment-grade credit rating and we always are in good shape for when these conditions eventually pass. What I'd say in terms of the production goal and kind of the way to think about production at the moment is, we did have a goal, we said looked at, against the CAD60 sort of price assumptions, we have the resource base. We don't see a problem with the resource base in order to continue to deliver projects and growth options to get to 400,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p class="p p5">However, with the lower pricing, again, we prioritize the balance sheet. And again, I just say the way I'm looking at this right now is that we're going to ensure that the balance sheet remains stable and strong. And that's going to be the first use of all cash coming into the company.</p>
<p class="p p5">And then I think as we go forward from there, we'll strongly prioritize sort of making sure the dividend becomes more competitive with -- not more competitive so much in our industry since the whole industries, dividends are dropping a lot, but more competitive with what -- I always say, look, we're a mature industry, we should be paying a dividend and it should be a good dividend. And we'd like to get back to that. And then as pricing allows, then we would start bringing back those options to start increasing production again. So, that's the way we're thinking about that.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Emily Chieng</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Great, that's super clear. And just one follow-up is just around from the operational cost savings that you've seen to-date. Relative to expectations anyway, you guys do a lot better on the OpEx front. How much of this can we carry forward? And how much is more one-time in nature?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Hart</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, no, Emily, its Jeff here. We are cognizant that 150 that we're putting out there is we really view that as sustainable savings here. There's other things that we're working through on obviously, deferrals and interim pieces, but in way too broadly think about that is I see a third is really focused on our onshore upstream in the integrated corridor, really realigning and getting efficiencies on how we operate in cold and Western Canada and streamlining that.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">On the corporate side, I'll say just about a quarter of it -- of those overall savings really come from optimizing our IS infrastructure rate reductions and just getting efficient there and make sure we get the best dollar out of our IS in corporate dollars. And then the remainder is really spread through Atlantic and downstream on rate reductions, efficiencies, and logistics and the likes. So, we do view it as sustainable and we'll continue to work it.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Emily Chieng</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Perfect. Appreciate the color.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">The next question is from Danny Wong of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Danny Wong</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is really around the I&amp;M part of the business. I think historically, you've broken it out. Now, going forward, you have it embedded within your operations. Just wanted to get a sense in terms of how much of that part of the business contributes to the results which came in a little bit better than what we were anticipating?</p>
<p class="p p6">And if you were able to parcel it out, how much did that kind of contributed -- quantify that benefit for the quarter?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Danny we'll come back with the details on you -- with you, but when you think about it broadly it's obviously with the with the heavy dips that that we saw in, in Western Canada, obviously, the margins on Keystone wouldn't have been impacted by that just simply because the Canadian heavy differential was fairly tight. So, obviously, that was more value attributed obviously into the Lloyd value chain because more of that value was generated in basin in essence and it'd be much the same with our export capacity on the -- in natural gas out of Western Canada.</p>
<p class="p p6">And you'll see that really both of those in the marketing and other in those two in those segments. And so the way I think most of that value is really driven by our export value and differentials between Canada and the U.S. and all the ultimate end markets and really say we're not a big drive value given we saw production come in and actually more the basin differentials tighten up and so most of that value was actually in basin and look at that marketing and other and really that's where we have our inventory valuations and the trading or the export pipelines.</p>
<p class="p p6">You want to add anything to that?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Danny Wong</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Great. Thanks for the color there. It's very helpful. Second question is really more of a strategic longer term question. Just obviously, as we were emerging from this kind of COVID downturn, just curious in terms of how you're thinking about how you might run the company a little differently going forward?</p>
<p class="p p6">I think a lot of it will probably be related to the operational side, but also curious in terms of how you might think about your financial side as well. And just trying to get a sense if there's any incremental challenges or even opportunities that come out of this going forward?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Well, good question -- rather broad question. I mean one thing we're going to do is we're going to capitalize on all the learnings that we've gotten through, again, another like a kind of stress test of the business. And that -- and we had an earlier question about retaining cost savings. So, a big, big focus is going to be on how do we make sure these remains structural cost savings and we don't go backwards.</p>
<p class="p p6">And some of the things that we've been doing, which are pretty fundamental on the operational side, is we've looked really hard at -- especially our more remote operations, if you think about the sea rows. If you think about our oil sands projects, where we have a certain amount of operating staff that are that are housed on site, the logistics of getting them back and forth is quite expensive.</p>
<p class="p p6">The allowances that need to be provided to those people are quite high and so we have been able to fairly radically reduce the number of people on site in these operations and provide much more service from the center.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">So, that is something that it actually yields quite material cost savings and I don't think we'll be going backwards on any of those things. So, those are some of the operational lessons.</p>
<p class="p p7">We also in the cold, heavy oil business, put a whole new different operating model in place with a lot more central control of everything that goes on in that operation. And again, it really made a step change in the costs in that business. And so again, I think that's structural and we won't be going back on that.</p>
<p class="p p7">So, the first thing is to do that. Of course, I think us along with almost every other business in the world is learning. There may be some additional savings can be achieved through the new technology that allows people to work from home or work from various locations still quite efficiently.</p>
<p class="p p7">So, again, we're -- one of the things we'll be doing in the next quarter is we're kind of evaluating exactly what the lessons that we're learning there are to see if there's a lower cost model as well going forward in terms of efficiencies.</p>
<p class="p p7">So, those are some of the things we're looking at going forward. There's probably more to your question than that, but that's probably what I would offer at the moment.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Danny Wong</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thanks for the thoughts. Just curious on the financial side, is it worth rethinking in terms of what's more appropriate leverage level, cash usage, things like that? Is there anybody thought on that side?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I think Jeff can probably answer this more fully than me. But I'd say look, we're -- our -- kind of our focus has for years and years always been on maintaining investment-grade credit ratings. And interestingly enough, I guess my takeaway on that I'd say is in this industry those, having an investment-grade credit rating is very important and particularly in the businesses we're in.</p>
<p class="p p7">So, I think that still is going to remain our focus. It's been -- it's served us incredibly well over decades, when -- since we've really started focusing on that and it ensures you're always a survivor at the end of these things. And you can come back and one of the things that's going on here in the background, as painful as all this is, is ultimately, you know, the competitive dynamics in the industry are improving.</p>
<p class="p p7">It's unfortunately, it's happening through a lot of pain and companies disappearing and things like that. But coming out of this, I'm still absolutely convinced the numbers tell you there will still be substantial hydrocarbon demand for quite a number of years, but the number of players in the industry is going to reduce and the competitive intensity, I think, is ultimately kind of dropping, which I think are good signs for the remaining companies in terms of their ability to be profitable long-term.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Danny Wong</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thanks Rob. Appreciate your thoughts.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">The next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Phil Gresh</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. Hey good morning. I apologize if this is maybe somewhat redundant, hopefully not topping between calls, but the commentary around the CapEx for next year is that essentially contingent on a CAD40 type of strip price scenario that we're seeing today. And if it were lower or if it were higher is there any thinking as to how you would potentially adjust that in either of those cases? Or is that just basically the floor level and if prices go up, you try to use any excess cash, say for the balance sheet or something else?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I'd say -- broadly speaking, answering that question, I just say, look, that capital number we put out there is kind of for an environment that looks a lot like today or a lot like the last quarter, I think is the way I would describe it.</p>
<p class="p p7">And if we saw substantially higher prices, then we have great opportunities to exploit some additional capital, though, again, I put that in the context that first, we want to ensure we've got the sustainable balance sheet and second, we're conscious that it'd be nice to give our shareholders a little bit more money back every quarter. But there are things we could invest in there.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">In terms of if the price is lower, of course, you can take capital lower than that for short periods of time, but you will see the impact on production going forward as you take it even further down from that number.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Phil Gresh</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay. And then the higher scenario, I guess, fair to say it would be more shorter cycle in thermal? And that you need to see a more significant or sustained price recovery for West White Rose or?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, I mean, what I -- yes, I think actually, as you look across the portfolio now, especially with the completion of 29-1, most of the capital that we spend is going into relatively short cycle projects with the only real exception being West White Rose. Although, it's got a certain -- it is about 60% or so complete. So, it's not like you're starting from square one. So, it's not a long, long cycle project. However, as I said earlier in the call, we're going to be doing work in this quarter to understand what our game plan is going to be around that project.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Phil Gresh</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Sure. Okay. My last question. Just, if you could remind me, with the Asia gas contracts, I believe there's price reopener potential in 2021, I think maybe later in the year. If you could remind me how that structurally works and what the possible, I guess, range of adjustments could be?? I think it's only a certain range of potential price adjustments.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Hart</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, it's Jeff here. I wouldn't classify really as a reopener. It's just the pricing opens up to a small range and color after kind of his five-year frame. So, it's not a reopener. And you got to think is right now you're probably in and around ballpark like CAD11 and you're kind of moodiness arranged between CAD9 and CAD13 as a point of this. So, it's not a reopener, you're living within a small band and it just is standard and what we have in the agreement.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Phil Gresh</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">The next question is from Prashant Rao of Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Prashant Rao</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of specific ones here, if you don't mind. Lloyd, the heavy value chain, either off cost -- of course off costs across the Board, you've brought down quite a bit, but the step down there seem to be fairly material. And I just wanted to make sure given the restructuring of the reporting structure and get a sense of how much of that was organic, versus could any of that potentially reclassification, just as we sort of think about carrying forward some of that strengthen the segment comes cost reduction that seemed particularly strong in the quarter. So, any color there would be helpful.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So, I'll start and in Andrew and Jeff, can further opine. But yes, the Lloyd value chain is -- there's -- I'd say there's a few things in there. Number one is realignment and reassessing all of our coal heavy oil production. We changed our operating model really centralized and just streamlined it and that savings are really starting to crystallize here in Q2 and refocus.</p>
<p class="p p8">And then on top of that the one thing as we discussed in -- as we went through the script here is effectively, we did cut back production in our thermal operations. So, you'll see a little bit of that that's a little bit of transport as you're bringing down the production. And we also just adjusted the upgrade rates down a little bit in the Q as well. But we -- a lot of those are sustainable. Some of them will come back with production as we as we ramp on the thermals.</p>
<p class="p p8">But the unit on a unit basis, they should be very sustainable.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Dahlin</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, absolutely. And maybe -- this is Andrew Dahlin speaking, just add a little bit of color, for example, on the coal, the benefits of the steps during the step change with me. I mean, if you go back to last year, unit operating costs to build on Rob's point, unit operating cost in our coal business was in excess of CAD30 per barrel. The step change we've now made in this operating model has taken our operating costs at the moment down to about CAD25 a barrel and we're out looking sort of around the mid-20s and go-forward operating costs. Very much reinforcing Jeff's message that these costs are structural and they're sustainable.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Prashant Rao</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up the price realizations in the offshore obviously, price realizations were weaker on a year-over-year, but seemed to hold up a bit more resiliently versus our expectations. So, again, trying to gauge the strength there and what -- how much to read into sort of what we're probably should that continued into 3Q, any color as to what could be structural in terms of market and what you're getting in price realizations? Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">There's nothing structural, what you saw in the quarter, much like we saw in the craft environments and some of the discounted pricing in the integrated quarter for the upstream as we did see the realizations come off Brent, a little bit just in this environment, because obviously there was excess of production as the market was rebalancing, but nothing structural, I'd expect our realizations relative on the liquid side to continue back to where they were aligned historical trends with Brent.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Hart</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. And then and then if we look at the overall realized price, I mean, they did benefit by strong liftings in the Asia-Pacific region. And we do get very good pricing there and so the -- and so the high volumes kind of flowed through and help realizations in that part of the business.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Prashant Rao</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Okay, that's clear. Thank you very much. I'll turn it over.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">The next question is from Manav Gupta of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Manav Gupta</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Hey, guys, I'm sorry of you have already addressed this. I just wanted a quick clarification when I look at oilsands and the diluted bitumen, the operating margin improved CAD20 -- per down, was this basically a function of condensate purchase lag which kicked in which allowed you to improve on the operating margin quarter-over-quarter, although the benchmark declined over there?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Rinker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. Hi Manav. This is Jeff. Can you hear me okay?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Manav Gupta</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes sir.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Rinker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">This is the Jeff Rinker; I'll speak to that a little bit. We did talk earlier about the former I&amp;M segment which is now embedded into the integrated corridor. And I think it's important to recognize that part of the reason why we had quite good realizations on the heavy oil in the integrated corridor this quarter was because of performance across the whole integrated value chain, which of course brings netback back to the fact of the heavy oil barrel. And so just because you don't see I&amp;M split out separately anymore, there's still quite a lot of good activity going along -- going on along that value chain.</p>
<p class="p p9">And in particular in the second quarter and we saw quite a lot of -- it's an understatement to say we saw quite a lot of volatility, there was tremendous volatility in the condensate price, you mentioned in the flat price, and all of the differentials and spreads that we deal with.</p>
<p class="p p9">And that did create for us some opportunities along the corridor. So, I think if you just look at -- if you modeled only, the flat price, the indexes, and the spreads, you would come to a lower netback than what we actually realized and some of the reason we improved on that, or we did better than that is because we were able to make some storage plays, some swap plays, some changing of crudes that we shipped on the pipeline, and really use our integrated value chain assets along the way to add to the netbacks that we received for the heavy oil.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Manav Gupta</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">That's very helpful. Second question in -- within your refining system, what are you seeing in terms of the demand -- specific relates to the areas where you are selling your product? What was the kind of trend was to 3Q versus 2Q? What kind of improvement are you seeing quarter-to-date versus the last quarter?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Rinker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes, so this is Jeff again. So, I think when I look at the statistics for the overall motor fuels demand in the U.S. and lower 48, we were pretty lucky in our location of our refineries that the U.S. Midwest was never suffered quite as deep a demand destruction I think as the Coasts did, even in the depths of the trough back in April and May. Still we had our refineries turned down to the 60% level for a time.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10">Since then, we've come back we're now running in the 80% to 90% utilization rate, which I think is a bit on the high side for the overall U.S. refining complex right now and for third quarter, Manav, I mean your guess is as good as mine, we're watching very, very closely the traffic patterns in the U.S., traffic patterns in our markets. We seem to be right now kind of stalled in that 80%, 90% range and we're hoping demand continues to recover.</p>
<p class="p p10">But we're very -- we're really very closely watching demand. We're going to calibrate the whole refinery throughputs and really the throughput of the whole integrated value chain to where demand is and not get ahead of ourselves. So, we get caught with stock builds that we can't place economically.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Manav Gupta</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">And the last question on my side is, when you are running your internal models, let's assume assuming a CAD40 TI and whatever differential, how confident are you of generating a surplus free cash flow in 2021 at this point of time?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Rinker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">I think -- they've done a little bit of that. I think the answer is if the forward strips play out, then we're quite confident.</p>

<p class="p p10">This concludes the analysts Q&amp;A portion of today's call. We will now take questions from members of the media. [Operator Instructions]</p>
<p class="p p10">Our first media question is from Chris Varcoe of The Calgary Herald. Please go ahead. Chris, your line is open.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Chris Varcoe</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Hi. I have two questions. Rob, the first one deals with the 30,000 barrels a day that is still shut-in. What do you need to see in order to bring that oil output back online? And when do you expect that might happen?</p>
<p class="p p10">And then, separately from that, is there concern with all the oil coming back online here in North America that it's going to start to impact prices? So, that's my first question.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Well, the answer has to be in general, on the 30,000 barrels per day, I mean, not that shut-in, because if we brought it on right now, it's a bit of a combination, it's mostly because with the price we're seeing right now, most of that would not contribute cash positive free cash flow to us if we brought it on. So, we just do those calculations on an ongoing basis and that's the basis we make.</p>
<p class="p p10">And on top of that, the other consideration, as I say, is just as Jeff actually said earlier, is looking at end use product demand, even if they're -- even in the short-term if we think we could generate an extra amount of cash at the margin on some of those barrels if we think that the market is not going to be able to absorb them well, then based on our what we're seeing in the downstream, then we'll hold them and keep them shut-in for -- until we're more comfortable that the markets can absorb them in in a good way.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Chris Varcoe</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Second question has to do with -- I guess I'm wondering what signal do you think it's sending this week when you hear the news of Deutsche Bank saying they're no longer going to fund the oilsands? Or even the news yesterday, that Total has taken a large write-down and believes that its Canadian oilsands production at Surmont and Port Hills are stranded. I guess what kind of signal do you think that's sending to the market and to the industry?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Well, first, let me just say, I certainly was disappointed with the Deutsche Bank position. And again probably like the premier, I think it ignores the facts and it ignores all the tremendous work that's going on in the industry to lower emissions intensity as well as our aspirations as an industry which I think we're making great progress on, to ensure that the oil from the oilsands is just as competitive from a carbon intensity point of view that of any other sort of supplies that you can get after. Very specifically, it doesn't affect Husky, we don't do any business with Deutsche Bank at the moment and haven’t for a long time.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p11">And the other thing I just point you to is Husky is going to be releasing its ESG Report, I think, next week now, it's going to contain our targets for lowering emissions intensity going forward. Also some other targets around diversity and then covers a whole spectrum of ESG issues. And again remind everybody that, well, people talk about ESG and people get focused on climate intensity -- or carbon intensity, in almost all other ESG metrics, Canadian production is lightyears ahead of most production around the world. It benchmarks at the very top of ESG metrics.</p>
<p class="p p11">So, certainly we'd like to invite all lenders, investors, stakeholders, and the media to review the ESG performance report when it comes out next week and let us know what they think.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Chris Varcoe</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">But more broadly, does it send I guess as a negative signal DO you think about people looking to invest in the oilsands when you see things like what Total did yesterday?</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Rob Peabody</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">I can't really speak to Total, in particular, from a very parochial viewpoint, I guess, I mean, look at look at it is less competition in the sector and good for us in the long-term in terms of profitability. And I guess, if other people see that as a negative sector, that'll only add to that sentiment.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Chris Varcoe</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rob Peabody for any closing remarks.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Rob Peabody</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">So, thanks, everyone, for your questions. Really appreciate your participation today. I'll sum-up by saying that we continue to focus on improving our resilience in what are really unprecedented times. We were working to further improve the sustainability of our base business and this includes staying disciplined in the integrated quarter to keep upstream production in step with product demand and take advantage of optimization opportunities as they arise.</p>
<p class="p p11">And just a reminder that we have two new projects coming on stream in the second half of the year, Spruce Lake Central and the 29-1 field that Liwan, both of these projects at current pricing will contribute to free cash flow, will add to free cash flow, further enhancing our resilience.</p>
<p class="p p11">Altogether, we're maintaining our capital discipline and preserving our financial strength, which will position us well for an eventual recovery of the global economy. Thanks again for calling in today.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating and have a pleasant day.</p></div>
