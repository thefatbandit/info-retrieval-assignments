<p class="p p1"><strong>David Sullivan</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you. Good morning everybody. Welcome to the WPX Energy second quarter 2020 earnings call. We appreciate your interest in WPX Energy.</p>
<p class="p p1">Rick Muncrief, our Chairman and CEO; Clay Gaspar, our President and COO; and Kevin Vann, our CFO will review the prepared slide presentation this morning. Along with Rick, Clay, Kevin, other members of the management team are available for questions after the presentation.</p>

<p class="p p1">So with that, Rick, I'll turn it over.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Rick Muncrief</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you, David. Good morning to everyone on today's webcast. Thank you for your time for your interest in WPX, and what our people continue to accomplish. This is obviously a year unlike any other, but we remain confident in our company and our nation's ability to get through this, very confident.</p>
<p class="p p1">As I said last quarter, we're going to need some patience for recovery to fully take hold. We're not there yet, but let's face it. We've seen some real progress in the last 90 days. Everyone would prefer to have greater certainty and a lot more clarity around the timeline for this pandemic that we're facing, but there's plenty of shades of grey and volatility right now. This demands a steady hand. That's why risk management practices are so core to the foundation of solid companies, including WPX.</p>
<p class="p p1">There's an art and a science when it comes to having the competence and experience to know how to navigate these rough waters. It's truly hard to imagine that all the scenarios we've seen play out across the globe and in our sector happened in just a matter of months, but they did. I credit our team for making sure that we were ready. That preparation makes all the difference when things around you appear to be falling apart. And acquisition is exactly what separates one company from another. You can't fake discipline, either have it or you don't.</p>
<p class="p p1">Your management philosophy most certainly gets magnified in an environment like this. And that's where our WPX story starts today. One is defined by stability, competence, continuity and positive results, even in such an unprecedented time. The strength of our balance sheet, our revolver capacity or commodity hedges and our track record for disciplined execution continues to give us a considerable edge.</p>
<p class="p p1">And let's not forget, this is a just about 2020. The position we're in and as thoughtful actions we're taking are going to benefit WPX shareholders in future years as well. Because of our prudent planning, we've been able to make quick, smart, sensible adjustments and necessary capital cuts, without slamming on the brakes in such a manner that since people flying through the windshield. I'm proud to say we've also honored our commitments to the market and to our service providers.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">We will continue to strive to do the right thing the right way. The continuity we have in our development program, despite the second quarter curtailments and shutdowns help us in so many ways, including our targeted exit rate this year, and what that means for our performance going forward. Now, the desired outcome, of course, for any well run business is to generate free cash flow and we have nice results there too.</p>
<p class="p p2">So with that, let's turn to Page 2. As you recall, we laid out two possible scenarios for the second half of 2020. We have determined scenario one, or exiting this year at 140,000 barrels of oil production, a day is the preferred round. Well, we don't know and because the visibility starting to occur, we reduced our capital spending by $50 million for the balance 2020. You can chalk this up to efficiencies, cost savings and our people and the cadence of how we're managing our development plan.</p>
<p class="p p2">At the same time, we're also raising our expectations for free cash flow from 100 million and 50 million to 200 million for this year. This is a direct result of what we achieved in the second quarter. I know this begs the question about the timing for dividend. Financially, we could do it right now like we'd originally targeted, but we also think it's also appropriate and prudent to try to ascertain a little more insight into the forward macro environment.</p>
<p class="p p2">Recall, we want to do something that's meaningful and durable, we're gaining more clarity internally of about what 2021 and 2022 could look like, which will help us nail down our decision. So stay tuned, please. We've also addressed some previous risks that we had going into 2021 by adding attractive hedges at $41 a barrel and building the revenue certainty, we'd like to have to support or capital programs.</p>
<p class="p p2">As always, we remained opportunistic by proactively reshaping our debt towers at a lower interest rate. Our next significant maturity doesn't occur until 2023, which is a very manageable $242 million. Finally, we're resuming our completions activity and a thoughtful moderated way. We're not going to get ahead of ourselves despite somewhat better commodity prices. We do value the continuity. It allows the revenue power we see, the data we've gained from the knobs return on or completions as well as the ability to begin realizing the incredible value from our Felix acquisition.</p>
<p class="p p2">I am still extremely impressed by everyone who is associated with such a seamless transition. There is one thing to integrate another company during a normal environment, but whole other matter to do it in the middle of a pandemic, working from home, managing social distancing and the like. This is significant feat that I don't want to go unnoticed or to be under appreciated, great job team.</p>
<p class="p p2">Now let's turn to Phase 3. This page shows our discipline and how we're approaching the back half of 2020. We've been busy bringing production back online, and now our team can return to a more normal business even as we scale back capital spending. What you're seeing here is an incremental approach to address our DUC inventory.</p>
<p class="p p2">This involves redeploying three completion crews in the third quarter as we work toward a planned exit rate of 140,000 barrels of oil per day at December 31st. This is a thoughtful plan which backed by our industry leading hedges for 2020 and one to supports our planning for the next couple of years. Because of how well we're positioned this year, we have the ability to do this in a way that's not stressing our balance sheet or putting short-term interest ahead of long-term value.</p>
<p class="p p2">Now I'll turn the call over to Clay Gaspar, President and COO, who will update you our company's operations, including some exciting results, one of our newest books pass. Let's turn to Page 4.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Clay Gaspar</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Thanks, Rick and good morning, everyone. As Rick mentioned, these are certainly unprecedented times. In the most stressful situations basic human instinct is to defend against the most immediate risks and progressively work towards longer term risks, and hopefully have the opportunity to act proactively on long-term opportunities. I hope you can sense from our comments today, WPX has been able to check the box on near and midterm concerns. And we are spending a fair amount of our energy towards positioning and opportunities for the coming years.</p>
<p class="p p3">The luxury of being able to consider value creating opportunities, rather than just defending against the debt collector at the door is on the back of years of work to build a strong asset base, sitting on top of a rock solid financial foundation, tended by a first class workforce, and driven by values of courage, results and relationships.</p>
<p class="p p3">On the last earnings call, we laid out two scenarios that helped delineate what the balance of 2020 might look like. The first scenario was assuming a quicker oil price recovery that will allow us to bring the completion crews back in the near-term, and we're doing just that. Please don't mistake this for the mindset of full speed ahead. We're still methodically working down rig counts, thoughtfully and safely tending to the wells that were curtailed, and at the same time bringing in the completion crews to work down the backlog of DUCs.</p>
<p class="p p3">The low 40 strip supports these actions and these actions will allow us to be very well positioned for this year's exit rate and more importantly 2021. Kevin will talk more about the maintenance capital and the free cash workplace implications for 2021. I can tell you that our actions in the second half of this year and material benefits '21 and a healthier floating and '21 puts us in great position for '22 and beyond.</p>
<p class="p p3">Now, let's turn to Slide 4 and discuss some more recent well results. First, let me thank the hard working integration team from all parts of our company that has worked to bring the Felix assets into the fold. I can conclusively say that we are fully integrated and are now focusing on driving incremental value through cost reduction, improve well performance, and importantly improving ESG considerations as well.</p>
<p class="p p3">The Felix [indiscernible] well for no pad is a great example of this value creation. We completed six wells by Felix that were drilled by Felix, and we elected to use the standard Felix completion on four, and a WPX style completion on the remaining two. The wells were similarly spaced, all to my laterals and even use the same flow back methodology. As you can see from the plots to the right, the fields completions were touched better than acquisition type curves, but the WPX completion style has significantly outperformed our approach. In fact, 46% better than we baked in for the acquisition case.</p>
<p class="p p3">Also with the same service companies on the same location, the WPX design was nearly $300,000 cheaper. I believe this is just the beginning. We still have significant opportunities on improving the landing and steering opportunities on casing design and on the overall cost structure. I will touch a bit more on this on the next slide. In the fourth quarter, we will have our first production on the Felix wells that were drilled and completed by WPX. I'm eager to show you the absolute results of these wells and how they perform versus the acquisition type curve that underwrote the acquisition.</p>
<p class="p p3">Now let's turn to Slide 5 and we'll talk about the Delaware well costs. First, I want to give a tip of the hat to the technical team, who's in the midst of the nine well CBR completion and state line. With the first sales expected in late August, once again having the ability to still focus on long-term value, we are investing in some science to better understand the very complex considerations of landing zones and spacing.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">One may question the timing of this investment, but when you consider the freed up bandwidth or technical team, as well as a very low cost environment. This is a perfect time to gather this Intel and understand the implications. On the CBR pad, the nine wells are landed in eight distinct landing zones. Each of these landing zones are proven and individually generate competitive returns even in today's pricing.</p>
<p class="p p4">What we are studying is how the completions interact and how we may be able to continue to tweak our completion design to cut costs and still yet improved performance. You may recall me mentioning the Pecos State project we did back in 2018. The technical work included a contiguous 800 foot core, running from the third bone springs all the way through the Wolfcamp B, fiber optics, microseismic, external pressure and temperature gauges.</p>
<p class="p p4">The Pecos project provided real tangible evidence that changed our completion design. We've used these learnings to save 10s of millions of dollars on subsequent wells in the Permian and also in the Wilson basis. It's also the basis for some of the changes that we're employing in the field wells. The CBR project is the next step and it takes a larger view up and down the columns to make sure that we're making the right decisions in regards to spacing, staggering and sequencing.</p>
<p class="p p4">I've had a preview of this data earlier this week, and I'm telling you, it's very compelling. The data collection can be hard to appreciate from the distance. We typically don't share progress along these lines, but I thought, it could be important to add some color and context to the limited state production data that's available publicly.</p>
<p class="p p4">Normalizing production per foot is a necessity, but certainly doesn't account for an incredible cost savings associated with longer laterals. Also, without having the ability to really understand the details of the spacing and the landing zones. It can be hard to discern what are the tests and what is progress towards development. Core to our culture is post appraisals and learning from the past. We look back at every well, every pad and every new test with a critical eye. We also do an all inclusive annual look back on each year's capital program and present that to the board.</p>
<p class="p p4">I can tell you with absolute certainty, with a consistent price tag the 2019 Permian results deliver better all inclusive returns than 2017 or '18. I also believe 2020 will outperform '19 with same methodology. When you take time to consider the costs as well as the productivity program, you can see the steady progress we're making on value creation. From where I said, I can also see a couple of step change improvements that will be more evident to the public in the coming quarters.</p>
<p class="p p4">Since 2018, we've reduced drilling, completion and facility cost by 35%. The second half of 2020, our well costs are benefiting from some deflation, but very significant percentage of the costs are related to changes like I described related to the Pecos State completion improvements. I should also note that these well costs include drilling, completions, facilities as well as artificial lift which is usually about $500,000 per well.</p>
<p class="p p4">I'll also remind you that when we announced the Felix deal, we assume no synergies in the purchase price. The economics of the deal, assume well cost of $10 million for Felix 2-mile Wolfcamp A. As you can see from the combined state line in Felix the well cost for 2-mile Wolfcamp A has significantly lower than the acquisition economics. The Felix wells are projected around 8.4 million in the state line wells, about 7.6 million. Narrowing that $800,000 delta is an opportunity for us to gain material additional value from each Felix well, more to come on.</p>
<p class="p p4">Now let's turn to Slide 6, and I'll discuss DAPL and our risk mitigation. The July 6th DC court order regarding DAPL was very disappointing, candidly people who think that pushing oil away from pipes and onto trucks and trains in the name of the environment are not thinking very clearly. The ultimate outcome of this court order is still very unpredictable, but proves requires us to mitigate potential downside risk.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">Our marketing group continues to have invasive, fixed price deals with trusted partners, and also moved quickly after the ruling to secure a one year rail deal, as well as transactions through additional tight capacity. Our original 2020 guidance assumed as Wilson oil differential of $5 to $5.50 for the full year 2020. After mitigating our exposure post DAPL, the post DAPL ruling, the second half of 2020 oil differential should be about $6 to $6.50 in Wilson. On a consolidated basis, the impact of overall oil differential is approximately $0.50.</p>
<p class="p p5">In the case that DAPL continues to flow, we'll be able to call back most of that incremental cost. This may be an unnecessary insurance policy, but we've shown before is protecting asymmetric downside risk can be well worth the small incremental fee.</p>
<p class="p p5">Now I'll turn it over to Kevin Vann, our CFO for financial update.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Kevin Vann</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Thanks Clay. And it goes without saying that wow, what a quarter. The operations team scrambled on both sides of the ball, the financial team working together with our marketing team optimize a risk management strategy, and our treasury team opportunistically hit the bond markets restacking from debt towers, as a WPX team as a whole remain focused on getting through the current file without taking our eye on her long term vision.</p>
<p class="p p5">In a quarter where oil traded for short time at less than zero on the open market and overall realized commodity prices dramatically declined, there's a lot of calm and consistency in what we accomplished. And that's what we're known for being able to take the curveball without bumping our knees because we're disciplined, proactive and balance sheet minded. We believe that the market has wanted and continues to want consistency. We are obviously in a commodity based business. The one thing you should expect from WPX is that we are proactive risk managers. We don't swing for the fences every quarter or every year.</p>
<p class="p p5">We do understand that the wants and desires of the investors' ebbs and flows, but running a good business always includes good risk management practices. It's on our resume here WPX. You've seen it from us over the last five years. You should expect it from us, because we expect it from ourselves. Risk management and extends way beyond hedging commodity prices as well. Are we perfect at everything? Of course not, no company with any level of self awareness believes itself to be so.</p>
<p class="p p5">We constantly evaluate how to get better. What others are doing and how to modify and adapt to dynamic environments. That may sound a little cliché, but think about our track record over the last five years. I think we have proven that. We did not just sit still and hope things got better as a natural gas producer. We were proactive. Many companies were not proactive risk managers and you are seeing the consequences of those decisions through this downturn and commodity prices.</p>
<p class="p p5">We have all been hit by the macro events right now. But we pride ourselves in being ready for the unexpected. We believe that you need to manage the risk or the risk will manage you. You're seeing financial stability, continuity in our development program and meaningful free cash flow. Of course, we have adjusted our capital program this year, but are utilizing the benefits of being active risk managers. Like I just mentioned, by utilizing the benefit of the shock absorbers we put in place long before the beginning of 2020. We always considered the financial outcome of anything we do in the field for others ramping down, cutting capital or starting to chip away at our decay inventory.</p>
<p class="p p5">Now turn to Slide 9, we generated 166 million in free cash flow for the quarter and expect approximately 200 million for the full year. Also, despite the decrease in average realized prices for all commodities are adjusted EBITDAX increased 17% from 666 million for the first half of 2019 to 779 million this year. For the quarter adjusted EBITDAX was up 15% over the same period last year. At 123,700barrels per day, our oil production is 26% higher than the same period of 2019. This increase is driven by the acquisition of Felix Energy in March. Despite the curtailment that clay discussed previously.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">Total equivalent barrels were up to 207,000 barrels per day were about 30% over the prior year, again, driven by the acquisition of Felix. For the second quarter, we are reporting an adjusted EBITDAX of 400 million, which is 53 million higher than the second quarter of prior year. The record quarterly results reflect the benefits of our risk management strategy, the steps we took to optimize our physical barrels versus our hedge position and the efforts to drive cost down during the quarter. Not only did actually costs go slightly down this quarter the cost per Boe came down as well.</p>
<p class="p p6">We're also reporting an adjusted net income of 69 million versus 37 million in 2019. The improvement was driven by the same items impacting adjusted EBITDAX as we realized $21.46 per variable revenues versus $57.42 this year or last year. But we're more than offset by the higher volumes of head realizations and prices north of $55 per barrel. Capital expenditures incurred for the second quarter totals 188 million. Of this amount approximately 173 million relates to drilling and completion activity for operating wells and 3 million for midstream infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p p6">Now let's turn to Slide 10. During our first quarter call, our plans for the balance of this year were unclear as we thought the current day fires caused by COVID and the prices were on commodity prices. As Clay mentioned, we're laid out a couple of options as to how the balance of the year might play out depending on crude pricing and the ultimate returns we believe we can achieve given our well costs. With crude pricing north of $40 for the balance of 2020 and around 43 per barrel next year, we're leaning into the first scenario, which has us exiting this year, around 140,000 barrels of oil per day, which will take us approximately 1.1 billion a full year capital to get there.</p>
<p class="p p6">I'm pleased to say that capital numbers $50 million lower than our previous estimates, and we will end the year with 35 to 40 dugs. More importantly, to keep our year-end production flat in '21 we estimate that it will take between 800 million to 850 million in capital. We also believe that we can generate approximately 200 million the free cash flow at roughly a $40 WTI price for '21. As Clay said, we are not only looking to the capital spin this year and next what that means to our 2022 trajectory in the capital efficiency we can achieve.</p>
<p class="p p6">Before I turn it back over to Rick, I want to say that we recognize the world has changed. WPX is adapting to it just like everybody else. One thing has not changed is WPX's approached proactive risk management. We didn't see the events of 2020 common, I don't think anybody did. However, our balance sheet was ready for this unforeseen blow. Our cash flow protection we had in place to help us absorb the shock, and I'm proud of how the WPX team made additional moves during the second quarter to protect the value for WPX shareholders.</p>
<p class="p p6">I'll turn it back to Rick for some closing comments.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Rick Muncrief</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to close where we started this morning. Simply put, I believe in the future of WPX, the significance of what our sector contributes to society, and the unmatched spirit that we have here in America to never back down. The challenges ahead remain daunting and real, but in our company, we're up to the task.</p>
<p class="p p6">We will continue to wholeheartedly embrace our responsibility socially and financially to deliver meaningful results. You can see that our second quarter numbers as we've gone through, you can see it in our 2020 ESG report is available now on our website. Our continued bias for action, how we strive to work closely with our stakeholders, and the training we provide to our employees.</p>
<p class="p p6">As always, I'm honored to serve our shareholders and represent our employees. So, operator, we can elevate a line for Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p7"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Asit Sen with Bank of America.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Asit Sen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Clay, appreciate all the color on DAPL and how you guys have adapting to the situation. And if I could go to Slide 7, you talked about the mitigating steps. Just wanted to probe a little bit on your comment on additional pipe agreements, and then the slide there you talk about sales outlet to Cushing, Clearbrook and PADD5. Could you provide a rough breakdown of that?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, I think some of the work that we've done here has been -- in building relationships over the years, we have a very good handle on the pole of those opportunities. We keep a real close eye on that. We knew right away that where the gaps were, where the opportunities were, and we move very aggressively on that. Some of the details, I don't think we're going to get into on the call, the nature of those individual agreements, but I tell you just kind of rolling the numbers up we're very well protected '20 and even out into '21. There's a thoughtful measure that we see is just that asymmetric risk, downside protection. That's how we kind of think about these things. I do have Greg Horne here if there's anything. Greg, you want to add a little bit more granular?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Greg Horne</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I think it's pretty sufficient, Clay.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Asit Sen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, thanks. And perhaps on the maintenance CapEx number, or scenario of $800 million to $850 million, broadly, how are you thinking about -- again, it's conceptual, how are you thinking about the split between the two basins either on a rig basis or a completion basis. And is the midstream CapEx number in there and what would the year-end 21 DUC count be in that scenario?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Year-end '20 or year-end '21?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Rick Muncrief</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Year-end '21. So as we think about DUC. We basically, we in the year was a 25 to 35 to 40 year-end '20. And then, during the first half of '21, we would consume what we call DUCs. And remember we have everybody's a little different definition of what we say is anything that's been online for 60 days above, the standard cadence. So post rig releases, its online 60 days. We put that into a special, but because that's a little bit abnormal for us. So, just that amount of wells, that would be what we talked about at year-end '20, first half '21, we consume that.</p>
<p class="p p7">As far as capital allocation between the two, we're currently running two rigs in the Wilson basin. We'll be going down the one later this summer. And that's pre-planned and that's very logical was very strategic part of our Felix acquisition is we wanted an oilier option to complement the state line that's in the ballpark of 50-50. And so the Felix has been roughly 70% helps us kind of push the oil numbers the way we would like and continue that oilier overall company distribution.</p>
<p class="p p7">So anyway, I would say one rig for Wilson basin and the balance in the Permian Basin, between Felix and Stateline. It swings until we really look at it as one big pool. And there's things that we do we may end up having five rigs on one side and then all five rigs jumps to the other side is close enough where that those low costs don't hurt to do that.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Derrick Whitfield</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">For my first question, I wanted to focus on your capital concept based on page six. Perhaps for Clay, the last bullet under the current cost environment section suggests there's additional cost downside. Would it be fair to assume you're speaking to the benefit of operational efficiencies in a flat service price environment? And if so, could you speak to the areas where you're seeing the greatest opportunities?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, great question, Derrick. You're exactly right. So, we didn't assume any move down commodity price. We're just looking at the strip and saying as that becomes more fully baked in some of that is deflationary. I mean, some of these, the smaller pieces of the overall cost equation kind of come into focus. But some of it is operational. I'd say one of the big things that we see, I pointed that 800,000 gap is the, on the Felix side, we have yet to bring out the real opportunity. And if you recall at the time of the announcement, we said we're going to be very thoughtful about not just shifting over pay this word to WPX or surely a works here.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">And we're finding things that Felix did that we're actually exporting to the state line area that work better. Some facilities things and others like. So before we lose that opportunity to really evaluate, we're doing several of these kind of side by side tests. Really excited about what happens with this most recent the workflow results and I think it's a good head to head comparison. But we have several more of those, some on the facility side, some on the drilling side. And as we bake those in, you'll see continued downside or downward pressure to that overall cost number in a flat commodity price environment regardless.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Derrick Whitfield</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Great. And then Clay just stay in on the operations on the Felix acreage. your first two wells are overwhelmingly positive based on the scores completion design tweaks. Are they in your view representative what you can attain in the Wolfcamp A across the Felix provision? And are there other non-completion oriented tweaks you'd like to attend in the coming months?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">I hesitate to redraw and hikers. I know that that can be very tempting to just say, okay, here's an export this on every single well. We're big believers in experimentation. We need to understand everything from spacing to drilling design, casing design is one other things, I pointed to facilities, combining some of this economies of scale. For the whole lot of knobs on the completion side, this work that we're doing over in CBR and Stateline right now, we'll have implications to the Felix area as well, that will, we'll use the same some of the same logic as we did last time in Wilson as well. So some of this kind of cross pollination between the basins but it takes a little time to digest some of that, and we're always tweaking and trying to make that next sub change improvement.</p>

<p class="p p8">Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Brian Singer</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Couple similar topics for my questions, first on the CapEx. Now you spent about $500 million in the first half of the year that would seem to imply about a $300 million quarterly run rate for the second half. The maintenance capital for next year implies about $200 million to $250 million quarterly run rate. Can you take us through the differences in cost structure or activity that will drive this reduction? And maybe the follow-up on Asit's question earlier as the DUCs a unique contributor to temporarily lower in the maintenance capital in '21?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, Brian, I mean, without question, we will benefit from the remaining DUCs in early '21. But the number that we disclose ballpark 35 DUCs a year-end, we've been pretty consistent on that messaging. We don't have anything significant bacon on cost structure reductions, although I would point to that as additional upside. The very dynamic nature of 2020 and dropping rigs, dropping frac crews bringing those frac crews back, make it a little bit hard to track quarter-to-quarter. But what we're projecting into '21 is much more flat, a flat capital outlook.</p>
<p class="p p8">Also it should be noted with a pullback in activity in our relative growth for '20, that sets us up with a little bit flatter base decline for '21. And that's something if you recall back a couple of quarters ago, we said at a five year objective is to flatten our base decline. We're really, really proud as a company that we've grown into on the back of some very significant growth years. But what we need to do now is mitigate, as we mitigate that growth, the flattening of their base decline really, really helps capital efficiency.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Vann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">And this is Kevin, as you think about the run rate for the second half of the year being roughly 300 quarter. You also have an ever trying to arrest the decline that we really created in the second quarter as a result of just curtailing activity and dropping completion crews. So that's why you see a little bit of a higher level of quarter-to-quarter in the back half of this year.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Brian Singer</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">And then my follow=up is with regards to the wells that you disclose here on the Felix stickers. But the data for this two well stickers up 60 days. Would have thought that the slow back strategy usually would show at or lower production in early days as opposed to more, which is what you're selling. So the first question is, is there an implication at the Delta? Well, performance should actually accelerate to your benefit in the future? And then second and then it's the part of the question that Derrick was asking earlier. It's hard to draw conclusions from just from just two wells or these wells, you're and what you would call your best acres, average acres or inferior acres within the fields block and we're within the West and East business?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Before I forget, Brian good to [indiscernible] that this was actually the lowest type curve in the acquisition model. So I'll get that out for the A. And so this is, I think there's upside from this, but I will give them same thing I said to Derrick. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. This is not the new type curve. These are two wells we're excited about, but we need to be thoughtful about, how we extrapolate that in so.</p>
<p class="p p9">Your first question was regards to the slow back technique, and it's very insightful good thinking on your part. Remember, what I said is, we use the same flow back strategy on both sets of wells before Felix, the two WPX. The difference, because we're using the same show changes, we're allowing the same kind of back pressure to happen. But what's happening, what it proves is, in the case of the WPX world, that fracture conductivity, we made a much more effective stimulation, and you're contacting have better connections to the reservoir.</p>
<p class="p p9">It's the same reservoir. These are wells right side by side. So it's not a difference in reservoir quality, but our connectivity that effective stimulation is just better. And so what that translates into is for the same job setting, you're just getting more volume through that. And so that volumes, those step changes that you make, and we're still opening these wells up 50 days in, that's just all the production we have. You just have a better, it's better evidence that you've connected to the rock in a more complete manner.</p>

<p class="p p9">Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Neal Dingmann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Rick and Clay, you got it, laid out of the plan that you've now been able to stick to. And I think the plan now speaks well into '21. There is be any notable changes, if we could get to change here something on gap over next week or two, as well as potentially something happens with a political regime in potentially January in the federal permits. Would anything change, do you foresee in the plan? I know you got some slides talks about it, it seems like your diffs in the Bakken wouldn’t change a whole lot, but I'm just wondering would anything really materially change on the plan, if we saw the sort of worst case of those two scenarios?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Rick Muncrief</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">We laid it out, I think pretty clearly don't see anything changing. We certainly almost the worst case scenario, we've covered that I think Greg Horne's team did a really, really nice job. And I think, we were articulating what that impact is to the Company at a $0.50 per barrel total company deducts. I think everybody can plug it in their models and see how it impacts us. But, we're hopeful that, the right decisions will be made but I think Clay and Kevin's comments just really illustrated, we look at it from a risk management standpoint and we made some nice decisions. Really proud of our team and so we've minimized the impact, I think. So, we'll go from there. We'll see what happens.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">The spot market, if DAPL remains open, the spot market will actually come down relative to where it's at. We'll actually recoup a little bit of that $0.50 along the way, or maybe even most of that $0.50. Who knows how that shakes out? So it's a really interesting insurance perspective where sort of, the worst case is you really need the insurance has been the $0.50, we very, very thankful to have it. If you don't need the insurance, you kind of recoup a little bit of that premium, so to speak.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10">The other thing is, you mentioned federal acreage. Remember, we have 160,000 acres in the Permian Basin. We have roughly something less than 30,000 acres, expose the federal lands in a fair amount of that is none operated. So I think we sit in a really good position in that regard. And it's something to consider as we think about as you roll forward the election process.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Neal Dingmann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">And then just one last one, you guys been, even last year, when you started about buying some stock that's a different things, you guys are really, you look at really quantitatively and I'm just wondering, again, if prices start to go back up, and you get, you're able to pay and basically get debt down to a comfortable level. I'm wondering, Rick for you, Clay and Kevin, when you think about it, with the next step, be more on shareholder return. And I know like this morning contract talks about potential variable dividend, kind of what do you see is potential options at that point?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Rick Muncrief</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes, I think for us Neal, the first thing would be, obviously shareholder returns. And I would say we would lean more toward implementing the dividend that something that really probably on the verge of doing and we debated it quite a bit at the board level. And just felt like the prudent thing was just to give it a little bit more time in our capital certainties. And I think, even since our last board meeting, we've come a long way.</p>
<p class="p p10">So I think that's the first thing, recall that we really don't have any near-term debt. So, as mentioned 240 million in 2023, Kevin, his team did a masterful job, I think in placing some new data turning around in reshaping some of those powers, but the reality was, is that our bonds are trading really strong and it was, end of the day it was not the economic decision to spend that last 100 million or so at this point in time.</p>
<p class="p p10">So we'll see how it all plays out. But that's near-term, I think do it in dividend initiation. And then obviously, if you had some help with commodity prices down the road, that's something we've kicked around here internally as well is something along the lines of variable dividends as well. So, I think, just point blank. That's kind of where we're at.</p>

<p class="p p10">Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Charles Meade</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">I wanted to ask a question about the Bakken or the Wilson first off. And then I appreciate that you guys have got out there and put your insurance in place and I like that terminology. But I'm curious at some point do you reach position, where just the insurance or the need to buy insurance to continue in the medical or that just becomes too much of a nuisance and it reduces your appetite to be exposed there and presumably there is some points, which it becomes too much. How close you are that right now?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Rick Muncrief</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Charles we look at this is we still have got some really nice inventories is deep, we'd like probably honestly, no. But that being said, it's going to generate a lot of free cash for us and for several years to come. And so I think we're quite a ways away from even considering something like you're asking about. Where we like the asset is going to generate a lot of free cash. As I mentioned, it's been really somewhat core to our performance over last few years. And we'll see how that all plays out.</p>
<p class="p p10">As far as the insurance costs, if you will, the reality is, there's only about 10 rigs running in the Williston Basin today. And so when you start thinking about the client of a basin even with some resumption of some completion activity, it's very, very measured, you're probably not going to see much of a rig increase up there until we get sustaining $55, $60 a barrel. And so for us, we think that if you've got a nice production profile coming out of a basement like that, I think there's going to be possibly some upside to that differential actually pulling back in as supply continues to decline, if there will be other plays out.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Charles Meade</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">My follow-up question is around your completion sequencing or cadency in the back half of the year. You guys have been really explicit and appreciate the way that you guys have laid out when those completion crews have gone back to work. But I wonder, if you can just give a little bit more color on the one connection piece between when the crew's good work and when you actually bring the wells online? And what I'm what I'm really kind of trying to get towards is, if there's a, if you've had a number of large pads, then maybe even though you brought on a couple of teachers here in July, you're going to bring another one on towards the end of queue. If those are all working on big pads, we might be looking at production toughing maybe in October. Alternatively, if you're going to have a couple of quick hits right off the bat, maybe we're looking at a kind of production for off in the end of August. What kind of color can you add it in that regard?</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Vann</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Yes, good question very perceptive. Because the basic line is real and any of the basins, these resource play basins, you stopped drilling or reduce the rig count tremendously. And for the production levels really start to fall. And we're certainly not immune from that we've never shy away from our basic lines. And when you run the math through that, you stop completing that base decline takes over for a period.</p>
<p class="p p11">Now, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we brought back a completion through in the Williston and one in the Permian, both in early July. Those production from that really come sometime, I would say, second half of August that will see production from both. And so what we've seen up to that point, is you have your base decline, our production engineers are working exceptionally hard to mitigate that base decline doing a lot of things to try and enhance production and a low cost environment.</p>
<p class="p p11">Specifically in the Wilson basin, we had the curtailment that we've talked fairly thoroughly through, and we're bringing those wells back online. So those guys are pretty busy bringing that production back online. So it's pretty dynamic. But to answer your question, pointedly, for the first two frac crews, they're kind of, they came in the first half of July, the production really manifest second half of August. That's somewhere between four and six weeks, and that includes all the completions, all of the drill up, and in the case of the Stateline frac crews, the other signs that I mentioned in my prepared remarks.</p>

<p class="p p11">Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with Stephens.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Gail Nicholson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">I'm just kind of curious, can you guys talk about how you're foreseeing elderly looking in the second half of 2020. And more specifically, how you think LOE really exit 2020 and this is good run rate to use in '21 forward?</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Yes, thank you, Gail. It's interesting, when challenging times come, your best teams really respond to it. And there's always another level of engagement and another level of creativity. And I think we've benefited from that. We were on a downward trajectory over the last few years, really working LOE.</p>
<p class="p p11">But in some of the ways we kind of, we installed out on maybe the creativity and maybe the desperation, maybe a different term. For commodity prices fell as much as it did, the message was delivered very effectively to the team, that man we need to we need to get really creative and we need very aggressive. You saw that in the second quarter numbers. I would say the only we had clouding the second quarter is at the same time we reduce the number of work overs.</p>
<p class="p p11">So thinking about the third quarter, the first half of that some of the creativity around, we can do this ourselves, we can be more efficient, some of those things will really stick and you'll see that improvements translate over. The cloudy part will be that we have a normal cadence of work overs and then as we bring these wells back, we have an additional level of work overs.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p12">So we may try and parse that out in the third quarter, so you get a better run rate. But I think the initial guidance for the year, I'm feeling very good about that. Maybe even encouraging towards the downside for the annual run rate and then as we push forward into '21, after see additional improvements from there.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Gail Nicholson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">And then just looking at the well cost, I mean you guys have made very impressive improvement on those -mile lateral, per lateral foot costs. Can you just talk about the Delta, between what a 2-mile lateral per foot cost is versus 1.5-mile lateral per food costs? And then how do you envision laterally trending in 21?</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">So it's interesting Gail. It's a number that varies over time and we're at one time, we were on the 2018. I think it was even maybe $1.5 million Delta for half miles. That was on the high side. I think as you compress down, it probably compresses to maybe $0.5 million on the low side, when things are really, really tight. So if you're approaching say $7.5 million well for 2-mile well, and maybe 6 to 6.5 on the 1-mile well, and then obviously those 1.5 somewhere right in between. All those numbers start to compress, but you still have some basic fundamental costs that are not variable, as you can't compress any further.</p>

<p class="p p12">Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with Keybanc.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Leo Mariani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">I wanted to follow up a little bit on shut-ins. I think you guys did a good job quantifying around 20,000 barrels a day here in the second quarter. Just wanted to get a sense of you guys might be able to quantify that number in the third quarter. Just from your prepared comments. It sounded like there was some lingering shut ins here in July?</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">We've been very measured on bringing them back. It's one of these things where you stack up a whole lot of work. And then you bring back your best, most reliable work over crews and the companies we prefer to work with. And then when there's excess work above and beyond, the question is how much further do you go? If we normally have a background of three or four work over rigs. We're going to run at five or six, we're going to run a seven or eight to accelerate that quicker.</p>
<p class="p p12">We've elected to kind of go five or six. And so that's best for all of us back to a certain cadence. I would say we're most of the way there certainly in Permian we've cleaned every back up. In the Williston, I would say by maybe the tail end of August, we should be kind of fully back to a normal run rate, which includes normal downtime for offset wells. And of course, you still have pumps failing and just the normal background of operations that we keep up with.</p>
<p class="p p12">So I would say, if you think of it as the second quarter being the numbers we articulated, and then you kind of translate that maybe halfway through the third quarter. You got to kind of that that wedge coming back. I think that could probably get you in the right direction. And maybe David can work through that if you follow up with him on the call.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Leo Mariani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">I think you guys have done a good job kind of articulating the maintenance case. If $40 WTI into next year, we're certainly allows you guys to have free cash flow. If I just wanted to really get a sense what would happen if we see meaningful higher prices, forgot to say that $45 level as an admin area, we got to feel comfortable putting some growth, back into the business going forward?</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Rick Muncrief</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Leo, that's a good quite one. Really where we're at today, I think you'd have to be closer to the, a sustained $50 before we really think about helping our growth just a little bit more. You start to think about what we and virtually every other management team has been faced with last few years and as we've had several headaches where you start seeing rising commodity prices, you get back to work and only to see at pullback for one reason or the other.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p13">So I think, it would be a very tempered and a very moderate approach to that. Well, I have some have some time and get a $50. If it's a $45 range, we'll probably just hold everything fast. Stack a little more free cash, and do that and be in a nice position we do have about 40% of our volumes hedged for 2021. So at least quite a bit of upside to, for us in the event that you see $50, $55, $60 crude, which is not out of the realm of possibility. We'll see how it all plays out.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Leo, I just may add one point to that. That's part of our downshifting strategy as well throughout 2020 is to make sure that we didn't need to reverse course, very aggressively. In the case of a quickly rebounding commodity price, it's quickly rebounded to 40 seems like it's found some kind of some stationary movement there. And then once we see the next, if it does move to 50, 55, and I think we can see some overall activity, kick up, but it'll be easier for us to do from the situation from where we sit today to take that next step.</p>

<p class="p p13">Our next question comes from Jeff Grampp with Northland.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Jeff Grampp</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">I had a question for you on the maintenance CapEx program for '21. And specifically, kind of honing in on the Bakken end with the one rig that you'll be exiting at, is that -- do you think that's sufficient to keep production kind of flat? And in other words, should we think about both basins kind of being in maintenance mode? Or is it more, some Permian growth and Bakken declined a little bit. So on corporate it's kind of maintenance mode?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Rick Muncrief</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Yes, I think we'd be looking at, a little bit of growth, certainly, early part of 2021. And then the reality is with one rig and if we didn't get caught up in over completions in certain play, like in manage all that you may start to see just a modest decline is that with one rig schedule. But we have a team, very talented is coming up with creative ways of managing that base decline and that production shifts have worked. But I think that's probably what the shake would look like.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Jeff Grampp</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">And another question on the cost side, I know we've talked on that a bit already, but referencing that Slide 6 again, depending on kind of your reference point, it looks like, it's called 10% to 15% plus type of reductions, looking at that second half number. Is there a way to, I guess, kind of quantify whether that is sticky and kind of internally driven versus just kind of service pricing concessions that might get clawed back at some point in time?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">We know that, that commodity or excuse me, service costs moves, and it will have to move in a $45, $50 world. But I think there's a lot of what we've -- what we have moved the needle on the Felix side is less about service costs and much more about just some change up changes operationally. And certainly a lot of the additional upside that we see, for example, that $800,000 that we're seeing today, really for the second half of the year, between Stateline and the Felix assets, that's not deflation, that is just opportunities on how do we kind of just call that a little bit back, probably $50,000 at a time and continue to make progress there. So, I would say that the specific points that you reference first half of '20, second half of '20, maybe it's one-third deflation and two thirds changes in operational philosophy.</p>

<p class="p p13">This has been touched upon, but maybe I'll ask more directly to send you can share how many net sales are baked in the 2021 programs. It sounds like there's some present in 2020 that benefits '21, but also sounds like you still carry some level DUCs setting into 2022? And I believe last quarter you talk about base decline selling to high 30s versus mid 40s this year, and I think what people make these struggles just bringing a lot of flesh production later this year, maybe can help us understand that the base decline mix between dateline Felix and Wilson?</p>

<p class="p p14">Back to the first question, I just want to make sure I understand it. We asking about the number of --</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="question">Will Thompson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">It's a net sales in 2021 in that 110, 120-ish.</p>

<p class="p p14">I would recommend Will, if you circle back with Dave after this call and let's get some the multifaceted question you asked and let's make sure that we do some good work on that for you and you can get in your model, right?</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">And one thing I would just caution is we're talking about maintenance capital. Clearly, that's not, we're not support. we're ready to issue guidance. Directionally, we've given enough information so that you can appreciate kind of where we're ending the year. How the base decline flattens, supplementing that with some new wells. I think it's pretty rough numbers right now. We're probably not going to get into the details of till's even on a per quarter basis, I think that's a little bit preemptive?</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="question">Will Thompson</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">And then Clay in terms of the CBR project and the interesting zone, you highlighted. You guys have argued that though to us clearly a sample Stateline well inventory. And correct me if I'm wrong at least, WPX had pivoted to the three target zones and Stateline certainly 2018. Obviously, the Pecos State project continues to pay dividends as we've seen the recent two as well results. But maybe I want to ask how do you think about, how to project and change your development program? And how WTX optimizing returns versus anything?</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Well, I think state-of-the-art for all of our areas and Stateline no difference. As we think about it in terms of what's hydraulically connected, and what we want to make sure and do. Let's say, we believe that the X, Y upper A, lower A, and maybe even the B, hydraulically connected. We don't want to go in and drill up the upper A, six months, a year, two years, three years later, come back and try and reach that X, Y, or that lower A, because now it's partially depleted. And really, you're going to have very ineffective completions.</p>
<p class="p p14">So part of this study is to really understand and map the fracture growth, and how it's, how things are growing. When you're stimulating, say, the X, Y, how much of the third owner you really touching, when you're in the Third Bone line versus the Third Bone sand is there interaction there, when you're in different landing zones of the Third Bone line or even the Second Bone with the interaction there.</p>
<p class="p p14">And so I think the most important information we're getting is a really a much better picture on what is the hydraulic connection. And so when we go in, we're talking about the three zones are really focusing on. Typically that's upper A, lower A and X, Y, or upper A, lower A and B depending on where you're at kind of in our legacy position. But we've also talked very excitedly about the potential for the Third Bone Springs, specifically in the line.</p>
<p class="p p14">And we've tested now at least three landing zones there and another one in the sand. And what we're trying to figure out is, what's the right hydraulic connection there? Do we go in with three landing zones? Or is it four, maybe it's two, to really effectively stimulate that and not leave ourselves a partially drained another landing interval that we essentially condemned in the process.</p>
<p class="p p14">So very importantly, we're all way up into the second bone, looking at an opportunity there all the way down to the D, looking at an opportunity there. And as I mentioned, every one of these zones and today's my price actually deliver a favorable return. And so what we want to understand, and it's beyond the scope of the Pecos State project, but this project is really focused on really understanding that vertical connectivity, and how big it taken one time.</p>

<p class="p p14">Our next question comes from Gabe Daoud with Cowen.</p>

<p class="p p15"><strong><span class="question">Gabe Daoud</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p15">Thanks for squeezing me and just a quick clarification and sorry if I missed it. The 850 million capital for next year. Did you say that in the Permian that assumes the 800 per foot expected well cost for the back half of 2020 or does that assume to 871 per foot in D&amp;C?</p>
<p class="p p15"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p15">Yes, we kept the 800 flat, the second half of the year number all the way flat through next year as well. Again, a flat commodity price. Personally, I think there's upside to that number, but we're not fine tuning that just yet. It's just a directional look.</p>

<p class="p p15">And our last question comes from Matt Portillo with TPH.</p>
<p class="p p15"><strong><span class="question">Matt Portillo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p15">This is probably a question for Clay. I was just curious as you've kind of improved your landing, targeting and also spacing design, how that's evolved around the Stateline acreage? And any contacts that you might be able to provide on some of your upstate wells around Stateline in 2020, versus maybe some of the tighter space wells that you might have been running in 2019 and before that timeframe? Just trying to get a better sense of the rate of change on the productivity and the recovery on those wells?</p>
<p class="p p15"><strong><span class="answer">Clay Gaspar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p15">Yes, Matt, I appreciate the question. Remember as you all know, the wells that come online in '19 are really kind of on the drawing board, maybe early '18, there's probably a 12, 16 month lag from when we conceptualize it to when it's actually producing just getting in the queue and all. So what we've seen is a steady progression, we have a space, I'd say state of the art probably four or five wells per landing zones in the Stateline area and we're really excited about what that material uptick in those wells productivity really means.</p>
<p class="p p15">2019 we had a mixed bag, summit six, summit five, that we were testing on it, we probably had a four in there somewhere along the way, maybe latter part of the year. But we're definitely seeing, I mean that correlation is true. And so it's an interesting knob, and it tied back to commodity prices and $65 world, AKA 2018, you might have a little different recipe to optimize value optimize returns than you would in 2019 pricing or certainly in today's pricing.</p>
<p class="p p15">So we're trying to monitor that. We've offered guidance to the technical team, to think a little bit longer term about how we see commodity price, not just running today's trip, but these wells, these decisions we're making, really implementing today's decisions in late '21. We need to understand what's the right recipe, we're seeing that correlation, we're excited about that, and we're also getting a better understanding from the latest projects into that the vertical connection as well, which is equally important.</p>
