<p class="p p1"><strong>Curtis Krawetz</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you, Veronica. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Alaris Royalty Corp.'s Conference call and webcast to discuss the financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, as well as a brief corporate update. I am Curtis Krawetz, Vice President of Investments and Investor Relations. And I'm joined today on the call by Steve King, President and Chief Executive Officer; as well as Darren Driscoll, Chief Financial Officer.

<p class="p p1"><strong>Darren Driscoll</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thanks, Curtis. And thanks everyone for joining. We're certainly pleased to be reporting a really solid quarter in a truly unique business environment. We continue to be so impressed with the management teams we partner with. A couple of had to battle through full patient closures and back to reopening while most have operated really well throughout. And a couple of thrives as opportunities have presented themselves. The financial impact of COVID on this quarter was much different than Q1. In Q2 we saw the deferral of revenue as we disclosed last quarter from Body Contours and Planet Fitness, which resulted in expected period, over period declines in revenue and EBITDA in both the three- and six-months ending June 30.</p>
<p class="p p1">At this time, we still do expect to collect that revenue, but haven't recorded any of it on our financial statements. We'll do so when we collect. On the upside, we did collect all accrued interest on the Kimco sub-debt as they finalize their new credit facility in the period, as well as a $400,000 common shared dividend we received from IMR or the quarter. Normalized earnings in the quarter of $16.2 million and normalized EBITDA of $17.3 million down from the prior year period. Again, due to those revenue deferrals we included normalized earnings in this quarter, as there were a significant -- there was a significant accounting entry in the period related tax that related to the 2019 change in U.S. income tax regulations. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">It's important to add though that just as we disclose last quarter, that our max exposure is still less than $2 million. So that's something we felt we needed some additional explanation on the notes, the financial statements, and in the MD&amp;A. Normalized earnings and normalized EBITDA on a six-month period, again, down to the revenue deferrals and the fair value adjustments that hit earnings in Q1, overall, a number of positive envelopment -- developments to report on for the quarter.</p>
<p class="p p2">First and foremost, the fair value increases of $8.5 million and a book value per share for Alaris at June 30 approximately $15.50. So with LMS, a write up of about $8 million, they were down $5 million in Q1. We were expecting LMS to have some challenges in a COVID environment, but the required nature of their business instead resulted in increasing revenues and EBITDA in April, May and June. And so instead of a small negative reset for LMS in 2021 and the potential for a deferral of revenues, we're expecting a reset of better than 10% and no interruption in distributions. </p>
<p class="p p2">GWM after no a fair value adjustment in Q1, we do a small $3.2 million decrease in fair value in Q2 as April and May were softer than expected due to hospitality industry drop-off. But June and the rest of the year are looking much better. GWM management is forecasting a 10% decline in revenue, which would mean an 8% decline in our distribution and results in a reduction in fair value. Having said that we remain very bullish on geo -- GWM in the long-term, and they expect a very good year of growth in 2021.</p>
<p class="p p2">Kimco, one of the businesses, we haven't had a positive news on in quite some time. They are thriving in this environment. Businesses are cleaning more than ever. Some specific to COVID cleanups and some just regular contract increases from cleaning from three or four days a week to five or six, or once a day to twice a day. Kimco refinanced its prior credit facility, switching to a new bank and a much more flexible facility and a bank that we know well during the quarter. We've already received their first partial distribution of a US$100,000 in the middle of July and that's their first distribution in two years. So that translates into a small but important fair value increase of $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="p p2">For BCC what a terrific comeback they've had from a complete shutdown of all locations in the middle of March. Full credit to this terrific management team for managing through the closures right back to all locations now open and distributions restarting in full for Q3. Well ahead of schedule of our initial estimate of Q1 2021 resulting in a $2 million increase in the fair value.</p>
<p class="p p2">And we also added a new partner Carey Electric for US$17 million, a 15% yield on our preface and a small amount of common shares that we do expect a dividend on and a management team we are big fans of. We also announced the conversion to an income trust that will go to shareholders for a vote at the end of August, alongside a 7% increase in the annual dividend or trust distribution to account for higher taxes on the trust distribution. The trust conversion will allow us to retain more capital in Germany by reducing admin expenses relating to operating subsidiaries in the Netherlands. And more importantly, reducing our effective tax rate on U.S. revenue, returning us to an overall tax rate comparable to where we were before these changes came in, as well as a lowered payout ratio.</p>
<p class="p p2">Our NCIB that we launched in late March allowed us to buy back 1.2 million shares at an average price of $8.69 saving almost $1.5 million and after-tax dividends at the new expected annual distribution rate of $1.24 per share. We also announced a favorable bank amendment that gives us all the flexibility we need over the next 12 to 15 months. And we're getting to work on an extension of the facility that currently matures September of 2021. And I just added, we've been very appreciative of the sport. Our entire banking syndicate has shown us throughout.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">In one of the more interesting developments, a significant opportunity rose for us to support our current partner, federal resources on their largest U.S. Government contract in their history not our typical pervert equity investment, but instead a show of support that allows us to use our balance sheet availabilities participate in a meaningful way as federal resources continues to be a primary provider of PPE to the U.S. Government agencies. In this case, collectively buying over 4 billion protective gloves to provide the U.S. government over the next 75 to 100 days.</p>
<p class="p p3">G&amp;A was higher than normal quarter with approximately $1.5 million spent on that trust conversion of one time a nonrecurring expense that we added back to normalize tables in the NDNA. Sadly more than offset the savings on G&amp;A, we've experienced -- Steve and I and or anyone else at Alaris has been on a plane or stayed in a hotel since early March. And finally given the continued uncertainties in the economic environment, we continue to not provide full year detailed guidance for now, and we'll get back to providing those numbers as soon as we can. However, we are confident providing our expected two, three revenues of $22.8 million. And that's just what we're expecting from preferred distributions and nothing on the federal resources opportunity.</p>
<p class="p p3">So those are the things I wanted to mention. I'll pass it over to Steve before heading into Q&amp;A.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Stephen King</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Great. Thanks, Darren. I have to say it's been tough to watch the news and read the newspaper over the last five months without feeling some serious nervousness presiding over $850 million portfolio of private companies. But as we sit here in late July, that nervousness has really turned to the admiration for our partners and, and excitement for the opportunities that are presenting themselves coming out of this lockdown.</p>
<p class="p p3">So when you step back and look at our portfolio as a whole, we have 17 partners, and the degree that our success that we've had over this period is quite incredible. 12 of the partners have had very strong performance with no disruption and distributions, no material change to the risk profiles going forward. And in fact, the majority of those 12 companies have continued to grow and included in that list now is Body Contours who, as Darren said, had to close all of their locations in March and April and are now operating at record levels. Two of our partners, Federal Resources and Kimco have hugely benefited and that leaves three companies that have been negatively impacted by the lockdown and Providence ccComm and Planet Fitness. The first two were longer term recovery, but Planet Fitness is ahead of forecast in their reopening. And we have full confidence, not only in them restarting distributions, but also catching up on everything that was missed during this time.</p>
<p class="p p3">So for us these unusual successes has made the structural benefits of our investment model even more obvious than during the good times. The vast majority of our portfolio have several things in common. The companies that provide required services that don't fluctuate greatly with the economy, they have very low and in most cases, no senior debt. They have very low required CapEx to maintain their operations. They have a large cash flow buffer to withstand unexpected volatility and their business -- and finally they have skilled management teams that are fully incented as long-term equity holders. So, all of those things have kind of come home to roost here in an extremely positive way during the pandemic. It's also been a great example of our value to our private company partners and their entrepreneurs. So during the best times like this, entrepreneurs don't want to put a value on their business, but by the same token would love to access capital to take advantage of unique opportunities in their industries. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">They also don't want to share in all the upside as they came out of a trough. So bidding on new deals, we're at a distinct advantage versus our common equity period. And with our limited participation, preferred shares, entrepreneurs are allowed to accomplish all of their goals and not give up control, or all of the upside. Also, our speed and flexibility and helping our partners has led to several outstanding opportunities. And this current one with Federal Resources that Darren described now moves to the top of that list that we've done over the years. Federal Resources came to us just a few days ago, as a matter of fact with this opportunity they had the largest PPE contract in their history. And one of the biggest in American history for more than 4 billion gloves part of their supply chain had lost their financing and required -- and the required fulfillment cycle was a very short period of time. So they could not really go to anybody that would have to start from scratch and need various levels of approvals through big banks and whatnot.</p>
<p class="p p4">So this was a super important deal for Federal Resources. Financially, it's -- as I mentioned, their largest contract in their history. It's also a vital one for them, because if you aren't able to perform on something like this, your chances of getting other large contracts with the government would be severely limited. And then finally it's an important one for the American people. Gloves -- medical gloves have become the hardest thing to acquire because of a shortage of rubber. So this one was extremely important for a number of reasons. We were very, very happy that we could have stepped in and we'll be well compensated for doing so.</p>
<p class="p p4">So looking forward we're seeing several actionable items to deploy more capital in this environment both with our current partners and also for new partnerships as well. Transactions similar to the one we closed with Carey Electric. Carey, the 97-year-old family owned business in a required industry -- required service industry that was able to grow nicely through the lockdown. There are several of those types of opportunities for us to pursue. I'm confident that we'll win those mandates and as we have for years now. So Veronica, I'll turn it over to you to take questions.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p4"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeff Fenwick with the company Cormark. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fenwick</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Good morning, guys. So why don't we start with federal resources in that agreement there, just help me understand this. This is effectively a working capital line for them. Is that how it's structured with you guys?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Stephen King</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">It's not really, Jeff, and because of the sensitivities of the contract and who the end user is, we can't go into a huge amount of detail on it. Obviously, we'll see the revenue and earnings show up over the next couple of quarters here, but we essentially took the place of someone in the supply chain directly and used our balance sheet. Obviously Federal Resources is the expert in this industry. So we don't have any additional things that we need to do here, but yes, it's not a traditional financing per se.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fenwick</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. But I guess at the end of the day, the U.S. government is a counter party and it sort of mitigates the -- I guess, the risk of doing that. That's fair to say.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Stephen King</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">It's a guaranteed government contract, the dollars already in an account waiting for delivery.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fenwick</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, okay. And granted, I understand you can't really disclose a lot of the terms here, but like in terms of the economics of this sort of in the ballpark -- of the sort of returns that you tend to target normally, or this just more about being a good partner and it'll help the overall revenue picture and the subsequent resets for you?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Stephen King</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. It's a -- we're getting paid on a per box. So we're getting a margin on a product as opposed to a return on our capital so that the returns on the outlay will be, if all goes well, significantly higher than what we're used to. But the number one thing was to facilitate this order and help out a company that's been absolutely booming through this through this pandemic.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fenwick</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And I guess you said this is a 10-week contract, sounds like it's already kicked off. Just to clarify, you said this was not included in your key three partner revenue guidance?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, that's correct. So yes, we made our first deposit but it was so fresh. We're just not sure we're actually even talking with our accounts. We're not sure how we're going to count for it when it comes in. So, there is a lot to be sorted through, but -- so our guidance on the $22.8 million is just our regular preferred distribution revenue and interest from our partners.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Stephen King</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And just the way I look at this one is obviously this is not something that is going to be repeated often. So for yours or anybody else's model, this is not something that you would analyze, obviously. So really what we're looking at here is hopefully some unusual profits that will pay for some of our future deployment without needing to raise it through debt or equity.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fenwick</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">That makes sense. And as smart as they're getting back to work here, it looks like you're getting distributions and back unlike. Have you done much thoughts about how you restructure [indiscernible] in the future or they just going to be sort of rolled in and half royalty period, or what kind of options are you looking at in terms of how you're going to structure those?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Stephen King</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, it seems like both with Body Contours and Planet Fitness that their caseloads dreams, they have such large buffers pre-pandemic and they're expected to get back to that. And Body Contours is already had that, that we can probably make this up fairly quickly over the next few months. Planet Fitness is a little tougher because we've got a senior lender that needs to be looked after. So that one's going to be a little longer, but again, I don't think it's going to be too complicated. I think it'll just be almost like a cash flow sweep going forward and hopefully paid back in a relatively short order.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fenwick</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. And I did want to ask just a bit of that senior lender at Planet Fitness, I know in the past, that's been a bit of an obstacle to negotiating, working with your partners. What's the sort of outlook in terms of how willing they are to play ball with you? Is this one of those ones that you did structure at the time with them to have a little more flexibility in how you relate to that lender? Or what's the status there?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, I'd say it's a senior lender. We have a -- there's a lead senior lender is a bank we have a long-term relationship with. They've been the lender on a number of different files. It is one of our more favorable covenant situations. But we do need all of those locations to be open. I mean they were at -- in February at an all-time high of revenue and EBITDA. And so it really is sort of quite tragic the timing, but this is a great business. People have been coming back to gyms in the U.S. certainly the Planet Fitness ones, certainly that low cost, $10 a month. They can operate at 50% capacity because they've never been full. And so this is a business that we do expect to return back to close to normal, and as far as the [indiscernible] lending relationship, it's certainly not a lock by any means, but we're having regular conversations. And it's a group that we're familiar with and -- but we're hopeful, but we need the business to be -- to have all their locations open and showing the bank that their cash flows are returning to normal and then we'll be good to go.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Stephen King</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, we thought it was an interesting thing, one of the counties in Florida that they have just one location and they actually re-closed last month and then reopened within two days thereafter it's -- it's proven to be a very difficult thing in the U.S. to close things down again, and they certainly don't see that happening. So you know, we're cautiously optimistic that we'll get all -- all the gyms reopened here over the next few weeks and be able to have that negotiation with the bank to see when we can restart our distributions and also start repaying the ones that were missed.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fenwick</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay, great. Thanks for that color all, I'll re-queue.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Great. Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Thank you very much. So your next question comes from Gary Ho calling from Desjardins Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Gary Ho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Good morning. Just going back to Federal Resources as well, maybe, can you talk about kind of what are the risks that this might carry that we might not be aware of? What's the structure on the PPE?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Stephen King</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">I think, the main risk is probably the very front end, in terms of the supplier, manufacturing, adequate quality gloves, but the nice thing there is that we will only pay with the small deposit down by the time we've seen the quality of those gloves. So, the rest happens after inspection. So, we think the risk is, is fairly low, but I think that would be the main risk in the supply chain.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Gary Ho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Got it. And then, I think you guys mentioned, the total commitment being US$100 million plus. Like, how much higher is it more than $100 million? Is that -- or should we just kind of take about $100 million as the purchase order size?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">It's not higher than $200 million and closer to $100 million. Pretty -- pretty close. Yes, there you go.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Gary Ho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. And then maybe just staying with Federal Resources, given that they're doing really, really well in this environment, is there a risk of them potential redeeming here with this partner?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Stephen King</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">No, we don't think so. Stepping up like this has really established the value of having a partner like us, they're getting bigger and bigger contracts. And, this is a company that is now sitting at more than triple what they would have been last year in terms of both revenue and EBITDA. So, you know, if you look at it from a few different angles, one is having a close partner that can act as quickly as we have for unusual circumstances. The other one is, if they would have had a common equity partner in play and had this kind of growth, that capital would have been enormously expensive for them as they would have grown with everything. We're going to grow by a modest amount this year with Federal Resources. So yes, if anything, this is really showing them the value of our partnership. And needless to say, they could not be happier with us right now.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Gary Ho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay, perfect. And then, Steve, just on the capital deployment side, what are you seeing, more opportunities? I know there's travel restrictions in place, perhaps maybe full on opportunities, any comments on this front?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Stephen King</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. So follow on opportunities, obviously, are preferred, deployment right now, because of what you mentioned with the travel restrictions. We'll never invest in a company that we don't spend time with face to face. So we're coming to grips with that right now I'm trying to figure out probably who in the office is going to be the guinea pig to -- to go down to the U.S. and then have to quarantine on the way back, because there are new opportunities that are coming to us in this environment. As I mentioned in my talk, if you're a company coming out of a time like this, you really don't want to value your business in a trough, multiples are down, sometimes the company's earnings have been muted by the endemic. So it's just not the time that you want to issue common equity but our press allow them to raise equity and pursue their opportunities without doing that.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">So it really is a great environment for us. We've got opportunities on the table that we can execute on but we're going to need to put some people down in the States and have them quarantine on the way back, because I don't see the border rules changing anytime soon.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Gary Ho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay. And these follow on opportunities, should we think timeline wise later this year or are they more kind of 2021 opportunities?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Stephen King</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">They will be 2020 for sure.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Gary Ho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay. And if we can sneak one more in. Darren, can you give us an update on that consolidated ECR that you guys published I think a quarter or two quarters ago?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, we're still about one and a half, Gary. It's pretty improved over last quarter, but there are some, you know, like the FR, Federal Resources, LMS, a couple have gone through the roof. And so we try to cap the big ones at a certain amount when we're -- because it can skew the information so it's a little bit better and still about 1.5.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Gary Ho</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, got it. Thanks. That's it for me.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thanks, Gary.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thank you very much. Your next question comes from Anthony Sandler from the company, Mackie Research. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Anthony Sandler</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is your G&amp;A is up fairly significantly over last year, for three months in six months. Somebody comment on that, please?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, you bet. As mentioned on the call and in the MD&amp;A, $1.5 million has gone in this quarter alone to the trust conversion. And so that's legal and accounting. It's a very expensive transaction that you need to make sure you do it right. So that is absolutely one time. A regular G&amp;A is actually well off where it is, as far as, corporate office, I think was $400,000 to $1 million. It's all really on that legal and accounting line related to the trust conversion for the most part.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Anthony Sandler</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thanks. I just want to confirm that. And just you seem to be double hit of tax issues with both the US IRS and CRA. How strongly do you feel that those appeals are going to work for CRA? Is there any chance of changing a decision from the IRS?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">They're two very different deals Anthony, the CRA is one that we were audited, gosh, got to be six, seven years ago now. It's been held in abeyance. There's a whole bunch of other people ahead of us. There's a couple of cases in particular that are in the appeals court at the moment. I think CRA is waiting to see how those go before they will deal with the rest of us that are in advance. We remain very confident that we've done everything correctly and will be successful. But we haven't heard from the CRA in a very long time on that. And I really don't expect to until those other deals are sorted out.</p>
<p class="p p7">From the IRS standpoint, it's our view that we can go ahead and file based on using the interest deductibility under the guidelines in 2019. KPMG did require us to make a provision, so hence that big accounting entry in Q2. Again, it's our view we will be successful with that application or with filing. Having said that on the IRS standpoint, the downside is we go an extra $1.8 million in tax and so it's really not a significant deal. We've paid through installments and have other opportunities that minimize the exposure on the IRS and effects.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Anthony Sandler</span></strong></p>

<p class="p p7">Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Zachary Evershed from the company, National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Zachary Evershed</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the quarter. Most of my questions have been answered. So, just a couple of housekeeping issues. First off, if all goes well with the trust conversion, given the timing there, how should we approach your tax rate in the third quarter?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">I'd say we'd be back to where we were, so in the low 20s, I would say, effective September 1, we will have a couple of months for Q3 where we're operating at a higher tax rate for July and August. But, assuming the trust conversion goes through on the September 1, our go forward tax rate will be overall in the 20% to 23% range.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Zachary Evershed</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thank you. Then, one last one. Your office cost as you mentioned, are way down due to coping with no partners conference, for example, do you see some of those costs coming back on the other side of COVID or are they out for good?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">No, that partner conference we have is a really important and valuable event that we hold each year where all of our top couple of people, executives of each of our partners come and we all assemble somewhere fun, and Steve sets it up like a wedding planner, and we put groups together that have common business issues or opportunities or maybe just the same personal hobbies, and it's a really valuable event, so that will certainly come back in that 2021, but we obviously pulled the pin this year. As far as our ongoing travel costs, I do think it will be less going forward. We've done a ton of our marketing with institutional and retail investors by Zoom meetings, and I think we still will get out and see people face to face in Montreal and Toronto and Vancouver and New York. But, I think companies will probably save a little cash on travel by doing more of these just for the Zoom or Microsoft Team meeting.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Zachary Evershed</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">All right, thanks very much. I'll turn it over.</p>

<p class="p p8">Thank you very much. Your next question comes from Anoop Prihar calling from the company, Stifel. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Anoop Prihar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Good morning, guys. Just two quick ones for me. Do you expect more common dividend again?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">We haven't put it into our run rate. We do expect it but we just -- because we missed Q1 we thought we wouldn't put it into the run rate until we had a regular track trend again. So while we do expect it, not a big amount, it's their intention to pay one but we'll put it in once they've had three or four more in a row.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, they've asked us to be cautious and our expectations -- they're feeling good about things, but just like everybody in the world, I think right now everybody wants to just be cautious.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Anoop Prihar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay, fair enough. And then just on the proposed increase in dividends from $0.29 to $0.31, subsequent to the approval of the conversion, please talk a little bit about the rationale behind that.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So sure, it really comes down to the makeup of the distribution the shareholder is going to get in September or I guess October when we pay it is going to be different than the one they got last time. This one is a 100% dividend while the future ones will be a combination of dividends, trust distributions and return of capital. So they'll have a different tax profile, I suppose. And so this increases basically to make shareholders even Steven at the end of the day, it allows us to, even with that increased distribution and keeping shareholders whole, it allows us to retain more capital in the business and lower our payout ratio because of the decrease in the U.S. tax rate.</p>

<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Hi, guys, just a quick one. For me, I think most of them are been covered. In terms of the deals what are some of the sectors that are showing the most promise that you're looking at in terms of the deal pipeline?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Stephen King</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">As usual, it's completely all over the map. We've got a deal that we're looking at, in an industry that we've never seen before. In our 16 years, we've got, you know, some that would be, you know, similar to, Carey Electric, kind of requiring service type businesses, others in the healthcare services space. So, yes, it's a very diverse pool of opportunities right now.</p>

<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Trevor Reynolds</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Hey guys, most of my questions have been answered. But just quickly on this Federal Resources deal, when do you expect to realize the revenue from that? Is it all going to be in Q3 or does that spill into Q4? Just a little bit of commentary on that?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">It'll be mostly Q3 into Q3 early Q4 is the timing. So yes, it's all the way throughout. It'll start shortly but I think it ends middle of October, I think, is the end of our horizon on that one.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Trevor Reynolds</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Thanks. And then, like do you expect to be able to release any more details on that, or is it something that we're just going to have to wait and see what pops out in the MD&amp;A and financials in Q3?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Stephen King</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes, I think that probably is going to be the case. Obviously, it's, very sensitive, especially when you're dealing with PPE equipment. I don't think anybody wants to brag about profits, or something like that.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Trevor Reynolds</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Got it. Thanks.</p>

<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Zachary Evershed</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Thank you. A quick follow-up on the Fed deal. I was under the impression that the payment would be one time, 15 days following the final delivery, so will that actually be payment received throughout the contract?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Darren Driscoll</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. The order is so large there is multiple orders and multiple shipments basically every week between now and then. So our, our cash outlay at any given time is much smaller than the total because we're getting cash in almost on a weekly basis. So yes, I think there's 10 different -- 10 different orders in total.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Zachary Evershed</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Okay, understood. Thank you.</p>
