Encouragingly, we regained sequential positive operating profit and efficiency, which was mainly attributable to effective cost control and ultimately demonstrated our ability to navigate the dynamic market and drive profitable growth. The performance in this quarter makes us remain confident that we are on to the right tract to achieve our long-term corporate goals and maximize shareholder value.</p>
