<p class="p p1">Thank you, Shiwei. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call. As the world comes to terms with the new normal, it is becoming increasingly clear that investment in business continuity, highly automated processes no longer an option.</p>
<p class="p p1">During this period, we've benefited from our ongoing efforts to automate a majority of our network, data center and service escalation processes. Our services having stood the test of this pandemic, are now more relevant than ever in a rapidly evolving IT landscape.</p>

<p class="p p2"><strong>Kamal Nath</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Thank you, Raju. Over the last quarter, we along with our customers have launched new modes of doing business. Our cloud at the core products and services are margin of the most relevant to the ground relatives [ph].</p>
<p class="p p2">Previously cloud hostile and cloud sceptical customers have opened up conversations about cloud adoption to de-risk their dependency on on-premise IT. Our cloud portfolio, together with our cloud adjacent Data Centers are the perfect solution for customers looking for quicker adoption of Hybrid IT.</p>
<p class="p p2">In line with the precedent, I would like to expand on the business highlights and our growth drivers. Revenue from data center-centric IT services grew 5% over the same quarter last year. Segment-wise, revenue from Data Center Services and Cloud and Managed Services grew 49% and 42% respectively, while revenue from Applications Integration Services and Technology Integration Services fell by 16% and 42% respectively. Revenue from Network Centric Services fell by 12% over the same quarter last year. Segment-wise, revenue from Data Connectivity Services grew 1%, while revenue from the Voice business fell by 42%.</p>
<p class="p p2">Let me now expand upon the growth drivers. The pandemic has accelerated the primary growth drivers in the market for cloud adoption, led by digital initiatives. This trend is triggering movement of workloads from on-premise Data Centers to hyperscale Public Cloud and hosted Private Cloud in varied degrees, based on the digital and cost objectives of the enterprise.</p>
<p class="p p2">Let me summarize the categories of customers who are signing up with Sify. To start with customers choosing Sify for migration on their on-premise data center to multi-cloud platforms like Cloudinfinit, AWS and Azure and Oracle. They also entrusted Sify with management and security.</p>

<p class="p p3">I will now hand over to our Chairman for this closing remarks. Chairman?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Raju Vegesna</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Thank you, Vijay. We view the current pandemic as an accelerator for our business model of digital transformation services. Companies are actively seeking us out for our cloud-based services that has time and again delivered customized process active solutions.</p>
<p class="p p3">We're now coming good as a solutions provider that can quickly expand capability across multiple landscapes. Our focus now is to consistently broaden the value that we deliver to our clients. Thank you for joining us on this call.</p>
<p class="p p3">I'll now hand over to the operator for questions. Operator?</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p3"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Greg Burns at Sidoti and Company. Your line is open Sir.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Greg Burns</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Good morning. So it looks like we're seeing the acceleration in demand in your data center and cloud-managed services, but we're not seeing that translate in the Technology Integration Services so -- but why do this time where you're seeing the strong growth in certain parts of your data center services, but maybe larger projects from transformation projects aren’t moving forward. Can you just talk about and in general what you're seeing with your customers in terms of conversations in the Technology Integration Services and the length of sales cycles there?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Kamal Nath</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Raju, you can answer please?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Raju Vegesna</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So as all of us are aware, most of the technology driven services business are when the customer spends upfront and with this current situation going on across the globe and definitely also in the Indian market, we expect this business to go down now only for us but for all the relevant player of the market and more customers will be adopting more cloud models where they need not spend CapEx and they're going to have a valuable model of IT consumption, which will be guided by their own business growth and IT consumption around the business growth.</p>
<p class="p p3">So this is a trend which is you're seeing, which you’ve started seeing for the past few quarters but the pandemic has only triggered that trend more now.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Greg Burns</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. So I guess the still longer term, this is not necessarily maybe it's been accelerated but the recent, what's going on in the market COVID, but this is a longer-term trend you expected the business to transition more to the assumption data center services away from kind of the Technology Integration Services. That's something outside of COVID that you expect to happen over time?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Raju Vegesna</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">I think what is the thing is before the system integrator hardware and on service data center used to the there, now it's moving towards the cloud and the data center space and now being the cloud that technology integration is more of a system integration going down. That means you see more adoption of the cloud either private, public and hybrid, we're seeing all the three fronts, especially hybrid is very important because nobody in the world just goes to public cloud. It is hybrid.</p>
<p class="p p3">So that is the way we position, we service, we have our own cloud platform and then also we service the public clouds and also we are one of the data center colo player. So the direction is going with the COVID is the direction we would like to see and is accelerating and we're seeing the trends going towards that helping us whereas our traditional technology integration sales of the hardware is going down.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Greg Burns</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. Perfect and then in terms of the network services, can you just talk about the [indiscernible] sales, the voice, what was driving the significant decline in voice and do you expect that to stabilize or rebound at some point this year?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Raju Vegesna</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yeah, I think that one, I think temporarily reduces, but I think it will over the time, I think that one will come back. People keep talking right and that one will come back, but our traditional network business is intact, but this voice is we believe that it could be temporary slowdown.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Greg Burns</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. Is there a difference in the margin profile, the voice versus the data component of business?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Raju Vegesna</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, we would like to sell the data. We are one of the biggest data network provider. Our interest to sell the more data than just the voice minutes..</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Greg Burns</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. All right. What was the debt balance at the end of the quarter?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">M P Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">The debt balance at the end of the quarter net of cash is $80 million.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Greg Burns</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">$80 million US dollars?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">M P Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Greg Burns</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. And then it seems like you have a couple big CapEx here so as two years since it slowed down a little bit this quarter this quarter, but what's your outlook in terms of investment this year around your network in data centers? Do you expect it to slow this year and then I guess do you expect your debt balance this year to decline?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Raju Vegesna</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I think we're going to invest both data centers and the network coming year and actually this is a great opportunity to expand our data center business and same thing we're doing the metro networks. So that way we will start spending to increase this opportunity to take our data center position in the network. So Vijay you want to answer on the debt point if it?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">M P Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, as far our debt balance is concerned, we currently have leveraging ability and as we keep getting our expansion plans executed, we'll use a combination of accruals and some amount of leveraging to meet the capital expenditure. It's likely to increase marginally as far as end of year is concerned, but in the relative longer term, we might try to use the leveraging ability effectively.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Greg Burns</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. Great. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Raju Vegesna</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Thank you, Greg.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">[Operator instructions] And I currently have no other questions holding. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing comments.</p>
