<p class="p p1"><strong>Zhiwei Zhao</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">[Foreign Language] Good morning and good evening. Thank you for joining us for today's earnings conference call.</p>
<p class="p p1">[Foreign Language] During the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a devastating blow to the Chinese economy and created unprecedented uncertainties for the global economy. The stock markets around the world experienced massive sell-offs and unusual volatility. As a result, our institutional business was negatively impacted as some institutions scaled down or postponed their advertising placements. And our business development activity were limited by the lockdowns and travel restrictions.</p>
<p class="p p1">However, our financial results of stable revenue and reduced loss demonstrated the resilience of our diversified offerings and the further improvement of cost controls, while we weather the storm and extended our leadership in online user engagements.</p>
<p class="p p1">[Foreign Language] Our ability to navigate through the challenging first quarter amid the downturn of the Shanghai stock market is mainly attributable to the outstanding performance of the investment advisory services. Over the decade, we have dedicated ourselves to better understand the behaviors of mass retail investors in China.</p>
<p class="p p1">We strongly believe that as the Chinese stock market continue to mature, more and more retail investors would willingly seek professionals' advice, and the transition from simple trading transactions to sophisticated wealth management programs will present more opportunities for professional financial service providers, including us.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">[Foreign Language] The growth of wealth management business also benefited from the fintech wealth management empowerment system that we have developed over the years. Now we are introducing this very system to institutions. Along with the secular trend that drives financial institutions' emphasis our wealth management, our investment education services, investment advisory services and asset allocation services are well received by more and more institutions.</p>
<p class="p p2">[Foreign Language] In the meantime, we are also constantly building up our service capabilities. In July, we formed a strategic partnership agreement with the global news and financial data's business, Dow Jones. The two parties will work together to better serve the huge financial information and data market in China. This partnership will combine global economic data alongside financial news and information expertise from Dow Jones with China Finance Online's domestic market-leading data and audience engagement to bring timely, quality and professional capital market information and intelligence to the Chinese investment and business audience.</p>
<p class="p p2">[Foreign Language] This partnership with Dow Jones symbolize a strong endorsement of our business philosophy that technology and data-driven knowledge will enable financial services and investors on their quest for excellence and success. For over 100 years, Dow Jones has established a distinguished reputation for its best-in-class global economic data, financial information and market intelligence.</p>
<p class="p p2">On the other hand, China Finance Online has been fully committed over the last 20 years to building and providing one of the largest financial and economic database for Chinese institutional and retail investors. We believe that this strategic partner is highly complementary and will create tremendous knowledge and data synergies as well as premium content to benefit over 1,000 of our institutional clients in China.</p>
<p class="p p2">Sophisticated data analytics and timely news have always been the vital building blocks for our data mining and smart research products that are dedicated to empowering wealth management services in China. We look forward to further collaborations with Dow Jones to explore more opportunities in the Chinese wealth management industry.</p>
<p class="p p2">[Foreign Language] In this new environment shaped by the pandemic, we continue to bring innovations to our operations. As a Tier 1 financial news aggregator, we enhanced our production capabilities to introduce a series of high-quality content such as webinars that we invited renowned domestic and international economists and chief strategists to share their views on economy as well as the emerging growth opportunities in the complicated post-pandemic world. We also continued to explore different medias and diversified channel to deliver our enriched content to our audience. For example, our account on the popular short-form video social media, Douyin, has already attracted nearly 1 million viewers.</p>
<p class="p p2">On new services, we introduced enterprise value-added services in the recent year. Through both online and offline channels, we provide professional communication services to companies listed on the domestic or international market. This new service has been retaining its growth momentum even during the turbulent first quarter.</p>
<p class="p p2">[Foreign Language] During the first quarter, the Chinese stock market suffered a tremendous loss. However, our Robo-Advisor product, Lingxi, produced an average return of 0.2%, once again, outclassing most peer Robo-Advisor products in the marketplace and significantly outperforming the Shanghai Composite Index that suffered a loss of 10% during the same period. The best strategy of Lingxi posted a return of 2.8% in the first quarter of 2020. All strategies of Lingxi managed to control the expected annualized fluctuation under 12.6%, while the expected annualized volatility of Shanghai Composite index reached 27.8% during the same period.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">Powered by our proprietary asset allocation system, Lingxi provides Chinese retail investors with a wide array of investment combinations and personalized global asset allocations through Chinese domestic mutual funds. Since its inception, Lingxi has established a solid track record of balancing performance and risk management.</p>
<p class="p p3">[Foreign Language] Looking into the future, we will continue to strengthen our fintech capabilities through optimization and upgrades of our services and products to empower the wealth management sector in China.</p>
