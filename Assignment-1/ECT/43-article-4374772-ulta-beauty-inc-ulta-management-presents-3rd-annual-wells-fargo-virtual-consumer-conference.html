<p class="p p1"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">All right, well, thanks everyone for coming back. We've got Ulta Beauty with us, really excited to have Scott and Dave here again; Scott Settersten, CFO; Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. I feel like Dave and Scott a year ago as we sat here, although we were in Laguna Beach, which was nice. The category has just started to crack a bit. I think there were a lot of questions about how you've managed that. On one hand, I think you guys have actually managed that pretty well. But on the flip side, I think, the overall environment couldn't be any less certain than it is right now. So just it's an interesting time.</p>
<p class="p p1">I guess my first question high level, it could get up to both you guys just what is COVID doing to you guys from a strategic standpoint in terms of how are you managing the multi-year strategy of the business? Just anything big picture that if COVID hadn't happened, maybe you guys wouldn't be talking about when you're sitting around the desk with all the executives.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Dave Kimbell</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. First of all, thanks for having us Ike. Great to see you, at least virtually, and hopefully we get back to more attractive surroundings for our next meeting together. But - yes, so, of course, this has been for everybody wildly disruptive time. So we have spent a lot of time over these last several months, both managing in the moment crisis of which there has been a lot of twists and turns like there have been for every company.</p>
<p class="p p1">But also thinking about what our strategic path is going forward and how we can take the strengths that we had coming into this and position ourselves to really accelerate coming out of that. And overall, we're really optimistic about that path forward for us. The way I'd summarize how we're thinking about the path forward is well a lot of the specific opportunities have evolved and shifted. The fundamental strategic direction that we saw for our business pre-COVID still remains. Key aspects of it like are - the first, the belief and confidence we have in the beauty category itself.</p>
<p class="p p1">We think while there's been ups and downs and some challenges in segments over time, we believe through all of our research and just looking back over time, the role that beauty plays in our consumers lives, the opportunity for us to continue to be a leader in connecting with our guests, and helping them express themselves to the world and bring to life everything that they want to through the way they look and feel. It's such an emotional category. It's such an innovation driven category. And as a leader in, we're really confident about the future path of the category itself. So that's one.</p>
<p class="p p1">And that hasn't changed. In fact, in some ways, this has called some evolution, but we think even new ways and more important ways, beauty category will play a big role going forward. And then our position coming into it, the things that have driven our company for really the history of it, I mean, we're 30 years old and some of the core aspects of our business is we think that have driven our success will continue to drive our success.</p>
<p class="p p1">One of the biggest differentiating features one of the elements that makes us really unique and special in the marketplace is our assortment, this idea of All Things Beauty, All in One Place, mass to prestige, all price points, all categories, hair care, skincare, bath, fragrance, makeup, every category across all price points and brands allows us to flex. And that's worked well for us pre-COVID and certainly is working well for us right now. And so, some of the fundamental building blocks of the company we think will still drive our business going forward.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Having said that, we think there's five, and I'll go through them really quickly, but probably there's five key areas that we were thinking about before COVID. And this crisis has evolved our thinking not the importance of each one of these, but how we might go and execute. First, we are an omnichannel retailer. We were before this crisis were even more so now as our e-commerce business like every - like most other retailers, our e-commerce business has really strengthened ours as - and we think that's a really good thing because we have more people that have experienced both our in-store and our online experience than we did just a few months ago.</p>
<p class="p p2">And history suggests that's a really positive result and driving greater share of wallet in connection. So we're going to be thinking even more omnichannel, more ways to engage our guests across both channels. The role of stores, expanding stores, the role of the e-commerce and building the best-in-class e-commerce experience that omnichannel work was underway and we're accelerating that. Guest experience is number two across all touch points. And there's key aspects of that that stay the same, but there's some elements that we think evolve.</p>
<p class="p p2">Trial and discovery is a big part of this category. And the way people will discover new items we think will shift. Right now, testers, as one example, are not available for most products in our stores. We think we'll get back to that, but we know the way our guest will discover products will look different. So we're evolving our focus in that. And so, the whole guest experience were accelerating and thinking about how in a post-COVID world that could look different. The third is assortment. And that, as I said, has played a big part in our success for our whole history. We're leaning into categories that were strong before, but we think will be even stronger coming out of this wellness, self care, categories like skin and bath and hair, fragrance. So, we're adjusting our assortment and leading into those.</p>
<p class="p p2">The fifth is around loyalty and that's been a big part of our business. We are proud to have what we believe is one of the best loyalty programs. And we're going to continue to innovate and drive connection through that because we know there's power in that. There's data and insights in that and that's got disrupted through this, but we're going to lean into that and drive even more. And then the last thing that's kind of the foundation in many ways is continuing to work hard on the cost structure of our business and the capabilities we have to succeed going forward.</p>
<p class="p p2">So we've had success over the last couple of years and some key initiatives to pull costs out of business. We're doubling down on that. At the same time, we're making sure we have the capabilities to deliver those other four examples. So we're excited about the future. We're managing through this crisis. We think the best we can, but we're also preparing ourselves to be the leader that we were coming into this and accelerate out of it going forward.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Great. And I want to touch on some of those omni and e-com details [indiscernible] Scott. But let me ask another question much more near-term. Just you talked about big improvements in the comp trend, July to August. What exactly drove that sequential improvement? And then was there anything unique in August that would have created a much better comp run rate relative to what you've been seeing?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Dave Kimbell</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, yes, what I'd say is, early in Q2 with our stores closed, of course, our comp was much more challenged with stores closed; that stores started to reopen in late May, June. We started opening them by July. We had pretty much all of our stores open then that's when we really saw kind of full engagement across the fleet across all markets. So, I'd say, a big factor was just getting our stores back open and getting our guests reengaged in the omnichannel experience. A lot of our guests that were previous store-only shoppers came online and so our stores were closed, but some didn't. And so, getting them back into store was the key focus for us. That's started happening in July is that all of our stores were ramping up and then strengthened as we moved into Q3.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">We did in order to reengage our guests, we had what we called our member appreciation month throughout the month of August, which was very purposeful in pinpointing those guests that all our data suggest should have shopped with us over the second quarter, but we think largely because our stores were closed and other disruption factors didn't get in them back in through engaging in the loyalty program points offers special programs with a key brand partners. So that really worked and helped to reengage our members. All of that is very purposeful in setting ourselves up to kind of rebuild and recover those guests that were disrupted by the store closures and everything else going on in the world around us.</p>
<p class="p p3">So August was a month to kind of get that kick, start that. We're in the middle right now of 21 days of beauty, which you know is one of our biggest promotional and traffic driving events of the year and we're pleased with the overall direction. And we're just taking steps then. And then we go into holiday at the end of the year, and gearing up to hopefully get back in where our guests are. It won't be normal by any stretch, but we're at least getting our guests back engaged. So that's why we're seeing some of the strength and we're very purposely trying to re-engage and get our guests back into the Ulta flow.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Got it. And then just I think you mentioned we talked about promotion. I mean, why exactly are you guys pulling back on promotion? Right now, it seems like driving traffic has got to be such an important thing. So how do you kind of balance promotion and traffic? And what's embedded in your outlook right now for the second half?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Dave Kimbell</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, well, first I just say we are still going to leverage promotional activities to do what you suggested and drive traffic to get customers engaged. But also more importantly to focus on those events and activities that have long-term equity building impact on our business. So I mentioned briefly 21 days of beauty, which we're in right now, where there is only a few days left Ike. So make sure you get in by the end of this week. But it's a great example of a strategic promotion. Yes, there is a discount related to it. But the purpose of this promotion is to do what we call mass migration to get those that are only shopping and mass to in many cases try a prestige brand for the first time.</p>
<p class="p p3">And we've done it for many years, and we have lots of history and analytics that demonstrate that is the behavior, not just in the moment, like I'm buying this discounted item, but I come back and engage in those items in entire brand, and there is equity built for us as we get more greater share their wallet, we're introducing them, we're moving them up and the brands. So that is a promotion with a real strategic purpose.</p>
<p class="p p3">Where we've been trying to pull back and optimize as those that are maybe not as strategic, not as equity building over time or have a very purposeful consumer driven other than just discounting. So two examples in Q2 that we talked about, we've had a big leader event, which is just a deep discount across a bunch of our large size professional shampoo and conditioner. Yes, it drove volume, but it really didn't have a sustained impact on our business and cannibalize core business, and over time was not a equity building and long-term sustainable type promotional activity.</p>
<p class="p p3">Similarly, we pull back with this broad scale 20% off coupon and will still do some of those occasionally. But those just serve to in the moment drive traffic, but don't lead to a long-term loyalty and connection to either Ulta or the brands that we carry.</p>
<p class="p p3">So we're shifting that focus to strategic initiatives, loyalty, there is a lot while those are the big things that everybody sees. We're trying to eliminate some of those. What is harder to see is all the pinpointed loyalty personalized promotions, identifying segments of guests that we think will be really excited about the newest launch we have and makeup and directing pinpointed high value high ROI promotions towards end. So it's not a total cut back on promotion as much as it is a shift to those higher value strategic ones. And so far, we think it's working.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Great. So I'm going to shift over to omni. I am going to talk to Scott for a little bit on this. I mean, Scott, we couldn't get a fireside chat without talking about channel margins. So, on the e-comside Scott, I don't know if you had a chance to see, but we put out a pretty detailed note on your guys last week discussing your margins by channel, I guess – can you update us on how best to think about profitability by channel today. In terms of what you're able to share with us?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Scott Settersten</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, so yes, we did. We're aware that you published a report last week and it was very well done, very thoughtful, very thorough view of your assumptions, right, but…</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Fair enough. Fair enough.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Scott Settersten</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Just important to remind everyone right, that this is an omnichannel business, right? Its brick and mortar and a digital e-commerce kind of working well together. We know that our most engaged omnichannel shoppers spend 3x what a normal brick and mortar only shopper spends over the course of a year. We also know over a long period of time that when we open up a new store, we get incremental e-commerce shoppers that come along with that, right.</p>
<p class="p p4">So again, it makes sense to us, right that people get closer to the brand and more engaged with us in this notion of newness and the beauty enthusiast shopping behaviors, they work equally well, whether it's in the store or online.</p>
<p class="p p4">Just remind people when we talk about omnichannel, there is five different ways that people engage with us, right, either to stores directly, what you call the DTC right through the website or the app and to our distribution network, they come into a store and we're out of stock, we can ship it to them right through our e-commerce capability to their home. We have BOPUS right and curbside service, right, BOPUS was rolled out late last year. So we're really just beginning to see kind of the power of what that can bring to the mix overall.</p>
<p class="p p4">And then finally, we tested some ship-from-store capability last year. We're going to do more of that this year. We're ramping up in the fourth quarter to have hopefully maybe 100 stores capable of doing that around the country in key markets to get us closer to the end customer, right, which provides some good cost benefit for us on the final mile kind of shipping equation.</p>
<p class="p p4">So we're not going to get <strong>- </strong>be able to get specific around actual margin basis points headwinds or tailwinds. Suffice it to say we think about the sales channels, it's holistic. And we think the same way around cost mitigation strategies, right. So it's not just what can we do in e-commerce cylinder, let's call it, so both<strong> - </strong>this is a way to mitigate some of that FFC and ship-from-store as a way to mitigate some of that. But there is also other elements as well.</p>
<p class="p p4">We mentioned some of that around some of the store service manager tweaks we're making to help take some cost out and to optimize our business, but there is a likely of other things, fixed store cost and rent leveraging other SG&amp;A opportunities as well to help us mitigate some of those, what I call natural headwinds that are part and parcel of the direct-to-consumer or what people commonly call the e-commerce business.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So we're not going to talk about the absolute margin until they understand that, but at a higher level, let's talk about the channel. So in e-com I guess my question would be, wherever those margins are, can they move higher? I mean, you talked about curbside and focus mixing up, Jacksonville is launching soon. It seems like the mix headwinds in the second quarter got much better than the first quarter. So it seems like there is some potential there to move the margins within the channel higher over time. Can you kind of just speak to that at a high level?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Scott Settersten</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure. So while it's unlikely that if compare an e-commerce direct to the front door sale versus a brick and mortar sale or some amalgamation of those other three methods we have of engaging with our guests. It's never going to be on parody, right? It's never going to be richer, I would say then some of the other avenues we have, the sales avenues we have. So again, that's kind of a given I would say on the front-end. And then the question becomes, what can you do to mitigate that, right? And again, it's more than just an e-commerce challenge or a gross margin challenge. It’s overall operating margins. That's kind of how we think about it again.</p>
<p class="p p5">Longer term, we need to be agnostic on where the sale originates, and how we complete the sale. Right. I mean, that's what true omnichannel means. And so we mentioned - I mentioned here a second ago, so both this and curbside it's clear to us that that's a better margin profile sale overall than a direct to the front door sale. All right. Things around the FFC. So Jacksonville moved up this year, right, it was planned, had gotten deferred to 2021, moved up, that's going to get us closer to end customers in a very key market for us in the southeast, especially the Florida market which is key for us.</p>
<p class="p p5">Getting closer to your customer is better on the cost equation side of things. Ship-from-store is another element of that, right? So again in key markets across the country, how do we get closer to the end customer to try to mitigate some of those shipping costs with surcharges, other things that we're grappling with as all retailers are at this point in time.</p>
<p class="p p5">And then when we shift to okay what else is there outside the e-commerce cylinder that you guys can influence, I mentioned service labor right in the store. So in the SG&amp;A line, store labor and benefits is the biggest driver of SG&amp;A for our company. We've been making significant investments there over the years, part of it, the boutique strategy, part of it, engagement with guests in the store, so a lot of things going on behind the scenes, but there is obviously again in light of COVID and the changing environment. There is definitely ways for us to optimize its class<strong>.</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">There is things around rent. I know we might talk a little bit about landlords and real estate and what's going on there. But our EFT efforts, remember, there is four major buckets there, and one of them is around our real estate strategy and what we can do to optimize our rent structures in our stores. There is a lot of work going on behind the scenes. We think that's a major lever that will help us mitigate some of the e-commerce channel headwinds we have in this feature.</p>
<p class="p p5">And then lastly, just SG&amp;A as a total bucket, right, again, in light of what we've seen here with disruption and assuming sales are going to be tougher. Right in the near term, there is definitely other areas of the business we're looking at across the enterprise to optimize the cost structure for the business. So again, we think there is a lot of opportunity over the longer-term, and the one thing in your report I was appreciative of that I will come and done as we both agree that double-digit EBIT margin is something that Ulta can deliver over the longer term [indiscernible].</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Got it. That was my last question on margin, actually, I mean, it's kind of – can you talk about each channel in and of itself. And on the e-com side, there are initiatives to push it up. On the store side, it sounds like there is labor and occupancy and some other levers that you're working with in a lower productivity and potential lower productivity environment going forward because of e-com, I guess, I don't know, your operating margins peaked at 13.5 to 14. You know, based on the conversations we have, some people don't think you'll ever get back to 10%. I mean, you guys seem pretty confident that double-digit is very much stable. I mean, can you elaborate a little bit on what you just kind of offered in terms of 10% and how you think about margins long-term?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Scott Settersten</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. So I mean, I would tend to agree that mid-teens operating margin that's going to be tough, right, but just in light of what we've seen with color cosmetics and digital shifts that we have in our business, and again some of the inherent headwinds that come with that. I would just remind people that we've said this call it 400 basis points that we've seen of headwind in 2020. Right when our stores were closed, and you become a just a solely a direct-to-consumer kind of business, that's not going to last forever, right? That's extraordinary. We've already seen sequential improvement. You alluded to that second quarter over first quarter, and we see in that continue to moderate as we get into the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="p p6">Again, the good news is I think Dave said this is, as the stores reopen, it's obvious that consumers our guests want to come back into the store environment, right. That's a key part of the equation here. And so, again, the strength what gives us confidence is coming out of the second quarter in the early part of the third quarter, again, those comps, right, again, net, net in light of everything that's going on, that's pretty good place to be. And we're just working on how do we continue to optimize the total model right, what do we do to mitigate some of the rate headwinds.</p>
<p class="p p6">And make sure we continue to invest for the future, right? Because there is just things we need to continue to work on to help elevate the guest experience for the long-term. And that's what we're focused on.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So, not to talk a little bit about holiday and this for David and yourself, Scott, just, you know, I think we're getting some rumblings of some cautiousness on holiday and this is just because of the uncertainty. I mean, you guys were the first explicit company that I saw that really kind of said, we're going to have a tougher Q4 than Q3 and here is why. Do you view that as just conservative, do you view that as really realistic and kind of what went into your thinking about your comps kind of decelerating on a rate basis in Q4 versus Q3?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Dave Kimbell</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, we look out over the rest of this year. And while I mentioned earlier, we're optimistic about our plans. We feel like we've got a very strong kind of holiday merchandising, marketing, our stores are ready to go, staffing, or e-commerce or distribution centers are cranked up and ready to handle demand. But we also balance that with a lot of uncertainty starting with consumer uncertainty for just in how they will choose to engage in Beauty and shopping in general. And, yes, hopefully it's conservative, but we think it's actually that's why we said - what we said is we think it's our best guess of what as we look over the landscape with a - with just a very disruptive marketplace, and consumer dynamics that we think are going to be like none other than pretty obvious. We think that's a good realistic representation of where we see our business. And the dynamics going on. It's just because while we're really competent in our business now and we're really excited because we feel like there is some strength and I talked about that, we talked about August coming back and feeling good about our business today.</p>
<p class="p p6">November and December are not like the other 10 months of the year, holiday is just a very different timeframe and different consumer mindset, different shopping occasions. We're competing with not just beauty, but everybody for gift giving. And so we're looking at the disruption and the different consumer dynamic going on, and putting the pieces together. And that's what we feel is this is realistic.</p>
<p class="p p6">I mean, I'll give you a couple of things that kind of come together to make us think about the uncertainty here is we feel nor in a normal year, holiday is driven from a consumer standpoint by what we call glamming and gifting. Glamming is – I am getting and I am going out to holiday parties and office parties and neighborhood events and we know that part is going to look different. I mean - maybe we'll be back to some level of that. But there is a lot of uncertainty about how big and bold and exciting this is going to be.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">Gifting, we actually feel pretty good about. We think beauty is a great gift category in a time of uncertainty where people are looking for things to feel better about themselves and wellness and caring for each other. So, we're feeling good about the gifting, but totality concerned about that, then you layer in the economic uncertainty that we're all well aware of and a lot of concerns and questions about unemployment and stimulus and what the rest of the year is going to look like.</p>
<p class="p p7">And then you throw in, of course, what a - at a minimum will be a pretty high volume election. And who knows what the output looks on that going into that key kind of beginning of Black Friday in November, early November. So all that says we know it's going to be disrupted. We feel prepared operationally. And from a consumer go to market strategy to get - to capture share and drive volume. But when we look at the - and assess the marketplace, those two months, we think, are going to behave a bit different than the time that we're in right now. And that's why we kind of framed it up the way that we did.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Is store volume the biggest unknown/headwind that you guys see for holiday? Or are there other things that maybe I'm not thinking about?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Dave Kimbell</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, I think that's probably the biggest. Yes, just store traffic comfort of coming into stores. We're going to work on trying to stretch that out. I know we've talked about that some. I know a lot of other retailers have - trying to kind of move out from us, big single Black Friday to stretching out. We announced we're going to be closed on Thanksgiving, again with the intent of trying to just stretch the volume out. So a lot of uncertainty about store traffic.</p>
<p class="p p7">Having said that, a lot of confidence in our e-commerce. And what Scott talked about was buy online pick up in store and curbside and app engagement. So we think we can offset some of that, but it is store traffic, but it's wrapped in this broader like consumer mindset and the types of things that our guests will be looking for in both shopping and what's going on in their lives during this really disruptive timeframe that we think will lead to that.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And then Scott, maybe for you come holiday time with Jacksonville up especially it's such a high volume period for e-com as it is. Do you have any capacity constraints on e-commerce orders that you're forecasting? And then we've heard a lot about shipping surcharges and shipping inflation. Is there anything on shipping that you think should be a margin call out for us although appreciate when thinking about margin dynamics in the fourth quarter?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Scott Settersten</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, so as far as capacity is concerned that was on our minds way back when COVID first kicked in, and that was one of our first actions was to pull that forward and get it queued up and ready to go for holiday this year, partly from just pure capacity for the network overall, but especially, as I said earlier, around that really key markets for us down in the southeast of the United States. So we feel good about where we are right now. Again, people, I think common knowledge kind of how this works. You're forecasting units, right. And you're working with your third-party shipping partners to make sure all that's kind of in equilibrium.</p>
<p class="p p7">And then you're thinking about the demand drivers, right. Like, how do you marry that up and just make sure you kind of keep it all working in unit since you don't get any negative surprises coming out of it. And then on the surcharges, again, everyone is kind of ferreting through this right now trying to figure out what the implications are for the holiday and whatever the future right. This whole thing is kind of a quick developing story. Again, yes, it's out there. Yes, it's probably going to have some kind of impacts, but we're still working through litigation study.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Last two real quick for you, Scott. Just a quick update on Canada, the thought process for next year. And then also just return to share repurchases and capital allocation, any update there for us?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Scott Settersten</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, so Canada, we're still on track. Again, it's we're on track for a handful of stores in 2021 and in e-commerce capability as well. So full go to market kind of strategy up there. And sorry, forgot the last one there.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Return to share repurchases.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Scott Settersten</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. So that again, disruption now a lot of uncertainty or being prudent and conservative in the near-term. But again, once things get back into equilibrium, we feel like that's the approach shareholders most appreciate at this point, and there would be no aversion to kind of going back on that path.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Got it. Scott, Dave, thank you so much again for participating. Hopefully next year in Laguna, but we appreciate it as always.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Scott Settersten</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Great. Thanks, Ike.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Ike Boruchow</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Scott Settersten</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">I appreciate it.</p>
