<p class="p p1">Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Hancock Whitney Corporation’s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call maybe recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Trisha Carlson, Investor Relations Manager. You may begin.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Trisha Carlson</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you and good afternoon. During today’s call, we may make forward-looking statements. We would like to remind everyone to carefully review the Safe Harbor language that was published with the earnings release and presentation and in the company’s most recent 10-K and 10-Q, including the risks and uncertainties identified therein. You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statements made by Hancock Whitney speak only as of the date on which they were made. As everyone understands, the current economic environment is rapidly evolving and changing.</p>
<p class="p p1">Hancock Whitney’s ability to accurately project results or predict the effects of future plans or strategies or predict market or economic development is inherently limited. We believe that the expectations reflected or implied by any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but are not guarantees of performance or results and our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in our forward-looking statements. Hancock Whitney undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.</p>
<p class="p p1">In addition, some of the remarks this morning contain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial tables. The presentation slides included in our 8-K are also posted with the conference call webcast link on the Investor Relations website. We will reference some of these slides in today’s call.</p>
<p class="p p1">Participating in today’s call are John Hairston, President and CEO; Mike Achary, CFO; and Chris Ziluca, Chief Credit Officer.</p>
<p class="p p1">I will now turn the call over to John Hairston.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>John Hairston</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you, Tricia and good afternoon everyone. Our timing for this quarter’s earnings release and call was different than our normal practice and we thank you for joining us late in the day. Today’s economic environment is challenging and evolves daily, sometimes hourly. In light of those challenges and volatility, we took significant steps in the second quarter to continue de-risking our balance sheet.</p>
<p class="p p1">After building a solid reserve for credit losses in the first quarter and then issuing sub-debt in June, we made a strategic decision to opportunistically divest a large portion of our energy portfolio. Since 2014, we have communicated a goal of reducing our energy-related exposure. We went from a high of 13.4% of total loans to just under 4.5% as of March 31. Our plan to diminish relies upon – and impact from this portion of our loan book was successfully working the book down to a less material level. In recent months growing concerns due to an ongoing supply demand mismatch were exacerbated by the global pandemic leading to a decision to accelerate reductions in exposure.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">We were pleased to reach an agreement with Oaktree Capital Management and sell over half the energy portfolio as of March 31, including the entire RBL book and substantial majority of the larger relationships in midstream and energy services, some, but not all of the credits in the sale were in deferral. Our remaining energy concentration is a portfolio of mostly granular support service credits, with an average outstanding balance of approximately $670,000. We have a healthy reserve and the remaining portfolio at 5.7% of energy loans and the transaction brings our energy portfolio sharply down to 1.7% of total loans, excluding PPP. Both non-performing loans and criticized loans declined significantly as shown on Slides 8 and 9 in the deck. And all but 2 of the remaining loans are pass rated credits. To complete the transaction, we booked a special provision of $160 million or $1.47 per diluted share in the second quarter, in addition to releasing the existing reserve on those credits of $82 million.</p>
<p class="p p2">Additionally, based on the updated economic forecast, during the second quarter, we built what we believe to be a stronger level of reserves for potential pandemic impact in our markets. So, additive to the special provision for the loan sale, we booked our provision of $147 million or $1.34 per diluted share. Our ACL to loans now stands at 2.3%, excluding PPP. On a positive note, loan payment deferrals applied at the onset of the pandemic began expiring in June.</p>
<p class="p p2">As noted on Slide 10 from a peak of $3.6 billion in outstandings in May, deferrals ended June at $2.7 billion and were further down to $1.4 billion as of July 15. We expect the trend to continue through mid-August all else equal. In an 8-K we filed in late June, we indicated an expectation of more than 50% of deferrals returning to normal payment upon maturity. Since that day through July 15, our expectations have been further refined such that we currently expect two-thirds to three quarters of our commercial customers to return to normal payment, while we work with the remaining on either a structured solution for our second deferral.</p>
<p class="p p2">Stepping back from credit, the core businesses within our company improved linked quarter. Growth in loans and deposits both reflect the impact of PPP fundings. PPNR was up 2.4% linked quarter and we kept expenses under control despite the sizeable costs and over time and other expenses necessary to just over 12,000 of our primarily small business clients with PPP loans. Looking forward, we remain committed to helping both our clients and associates manage through this pandemic event and we believe we are making decisions in the best interest of our shareholders.</p>
<p class="p p2">With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Achary for few additional comments and details.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Mike Achary</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect a loss of $117 million or $1.36 per share. They include, as John mentioned, $160 million special provision for the energy loan sale as well as an additional $147 million provision related to updated, COVID-19 forecast and modeling. Excluding the special provision from the loan sale at a 21% tax rate, earnings would have been $9.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Recalling out the tax rate since our second quarter, effective tax rate was 39%. Due to our year-to-date loss, tax credits and other tax related items, we weren’t able to report a profit after tax excluding the sale. We did expect the effective tax rate to normalize in the back half of the year at about 18%.</p>
<p class="p p2">Loans for the company increased $1.1 billion from March 31. This growth included $2.3 billion in PPP fundings partly offset by the energy loan sales of $497 million and about $500 million in pay-downs on lines of credit. As a reminder, we had a similar amount of line draws in the first quarter as clients built liquidity in an abundance of caution associated with the uncertainty surrounded COVID-19. Despots were up $2.3 billion as PPP funding remained for the most part in customer DDA accounts. Also the balance sheet was flushed with liquidity with almost $760 million at quarter end and $17 billion in untapped sources of funding. Consistent with our intra-quarter comments, the margin declined 18 basis points linked quarter mainly related to the Fed rate moves at the end of March.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">Slide 23 notes the headwinds and tailwinds and the waterfall chart notes the basis point impact per item. We believe the NIM will mostly stay in the range of a couple of basis points, plus or minus from where we are now, at least for the next couple of quarters, which is about as far out if we have decent visibility. John has already covered the loan sale and provision discussion points. But I would like to mention that for the quarter, we use Moody’s June forecast for our macroeconomic assumptions. These are listed on Slide 18 in our earnings deck. We believe these scenarios present a reasonable mix of economic forecast and are appropriate for our ACL modeling purposes.</p>
<p class="p p3">Our fee income balances were down in most areas either related to market dynamics or stimulus payments reducing overall fees. Secondary mortgage income is offsetting some of those declines in what’s becoming a very favorable rate environment for mortgage banking with increased volumes. Non-interest expense was down $7 million linked quarter, reflecting equity write-offs of energy-related credits in the first quarter. The increase in personnel expense was mostly related to annual merit increases in April and over time pay related to mortgage lending and PPP applications.</p>
<p class="p p3">Our capital remains solid and in excess of regulatory minimums, including buffers as detailed on Slide 28. TCE did fall below 8% to 7.33% as of June 30. However, we expect to rebuild the levels closer to 8% by year-in. 36 basis points of the drop from last quarter was related to the loan sale, with another 56 basis points due to the impact on TCE of the $2.3 billion in PPP funding. Finally, we do expect to pay our quarterly dividend, but are in consultation with our examiners. As always, the Board reviews our dividend policy quarterly.</p>
<p class="p p3">With that, I will turn the call back to John.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>John Hairston</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Thanks Mike. Let’s just open the call for questions.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p3"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Michael Rose</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Hey, good afternoon, guys. Certainly understand the loan sale. I think a lot of us were surprised by the magnitude of the severity that you guys thought. Can you just give some rationale as to why sell now and maybe why didn’t you hit the bid, couple of months ago, as you were de-risking the portfolio and maybe what does energy lending look for Hancock Whitney going forward into the business that you continue to plan to be in? Thanks.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Thanks, Michael. This is John. I will start and Mike can add color or Chris can. If we look back in time, we have been ratcheting the concentrations down really since 2014. And in the last couple of years, a good bit of quarter-over-quarter improvement in the book and then as we got toward the end of the year, the end of last year supply demand mismatch began to get worse. We all saw what happened as fears in the market took place around a storage capacity and whatnot. And when looking in the future, the likelihood in a pandemic environment, that demand was going to go up fast enough with the challenges that RBL, particularly companies in the RBL business have with raising equity just in the private market. The concern was that demand just wouldn’t get up fast enough to cover some of those issues. And we would see no further deterioration in the book. And we had a buyer who was both sophisticated, had the capacity to purchase meaningfully all of the RBL midstream in a very large percentage of the lumpy credits in the services side. So I think the degree and the quality of the partner that we had allowed us to do a transaction that was more conclusive to just small pieces at a time. And so while certainly, we admit the discount appears steep, I think time will tell whether it was a steep discount or whether it was a reasonable discount just over time. And so the benefit to us and to shareholders is the fact that the book is now de-risked from an energy perspective. And the residual book has a far lesser average loan size than what we sold. So I think the average outstanding on the book we sold was a little over $11 million and the residual amount is about $1 million per loan. So it’s a – and that’s by the time you take out all the zero balances about $1 million of loan. So in terms of going forward, Michael, the book that remains are primarily small to medium sized businesses with a more diversified revenue stream and just simply the scale of the book being less and the client size being something that we believe is a lot less risky from an investor point of view is a business that while I think the balance sheet will continue to diminish, the content of it is something we are a lot more comfortable with.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Achary</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Mike, this is Mike. So the things I would add to John’s comments, probably first and foremost is on Friday, we announced that the agreement to sell the portfolio was executed. And then this afternoon we actually were able to close the transaction. So, all aspects of the transaction are really kind of behind us now. The other thing that I would add and I think this is obviously pretty important, but we look at all of these activities that we have kind of undertaken in the first half of this year as part of our overall de-risking strategy, if you will. So we proactively built reserves pretty substantially in the first quarter. We added to that in the second quarter aside from the loan sale. So, our ACL to loan stands at about 236 basis points right now. We raised some sub-debt during the second quarter and then took the opportunity, as John mentioned, to deploy some of that sub-debt if you will, towards further de-risking our balance sheet through the sale of a big part of the energy portfolio. So again, we look at all of those activities really is kind of an overall de-risking plan.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Michael Rose</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I appreciate all the color. And just as a follow-up, I wanted to talk about the dividend a little bit. We had a larger bank in Texas today note that regulators really have not given them any guidance around using the CCAR fourth quarter look back in terms of dividend tests. I mean, where you use that for you guys, given two consecutive quarter losses, it doesn’t look good to the dividend, but there also are some countervailing forces, maybe if you can just walk through how you guys think about ability to pay the dividend and capital adequacy? Thanks.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Achary</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Sure. I’d be glad to. So, look, we think and believe that our capital ratios really do help us support the payment of the dividend in the third quarter and kind of on a go forward basis. But look, we have been real transparent with our examiners through – so through really the entire process of looking at de-risking our balance sheet through the reserve builds as well as through the sale of the energy book, we have kind of kept in constant contact with our examiners. And they absolutely support the actions that we have done. And as we said in the deck and on the script, we do intend to pay the third quarter dividend. But of course, we are in consultation with our examiners as well as our board. So, that process should be completed within the next 30 days or so. And then we will kind of go from there.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Michael Rose</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Great. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">You bet. Thank you. Michael.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Our next question comes from Kevin Fitzsimmons with DA Davidson. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Kevin Fitzsimmons</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Hey, good afternoon guys. If we could just touch on deferrals, I recognize that I appreciate that detail, that have peaked and now it’s declined. Just curious what your outlook is on where this settles. In other words, there is probably some remaining first round deferrals that have not yet matured and I am not sure where you are at in the process of having conversations with folks that may need a round to deferral? So, if I did my math, right, I think as of mid-July, you are roughly at a little over 6% of loans in deferral and where you think that might settle as you progress out over the next several weeks and get into more of a Round 2 scenario?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So, Chris, you want to take down?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Chris Ziluca</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, sure. Yes, this is Chris Ziluca. As you pointed out, right now, we are settling out as at I believe 7.15% at around a little over 6% closer to 7% right now of deferrals. That’s come down pretty steadily since the peak. And as we also indicated earlier on in the conversation, we have kind of refined our expectation around customers going back to normal payment to the two-thirds to three quarters level, which basically indicates that the remaining portion is where we are focusing our attention mostly around structured solutions to handle issues that may linger longer than just the regulatory guidance around less than 180 days. And to the extent that a customer feels that they are closer to resolving their operating challenges, then we would entertain a shorter second deferral to kind of bridge that gap. So, we have pretty active dialogue on a weekly basis with our client-facing teams to ensure that we are executing on the plan more focused on structured solutions to the extent that anything additional goes beyond that timeframe. And we are feeling pretty confident, lot of the conversations that we are having, certainly a lot of them are focused around the hospitality sector, including hotel and some of our full-service restaurant clientele in the New Orleans market, but overall, I think we see some real positive dialogue going on between us and our clients to kind of bridge the divide here as it relates to the pandemic.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Kevin Fitzsimmons</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Great. Thanks, Chris. Just one quick follow-up if on the subject of de-risking, are there any other than obviously monitoring the loan book and deferrals for COVID-19, are there other de-risking type of activities or moves that you guys are evaluating and you think you have at your disposal? And as a related point, are there any expense initiatives that you are considering that might be – that might fall into that line as well? Thanks.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay, this is John, I’ll start at the end and work my way back to credit in terms of expense treatment. We have got a good history of taking good views or rationalizing expenses in both good times and bad. Certainly the environment that we are in now leads to volumes of various activities being somewhat diminished. Some of those are coming back, like fee income, and etcetera. Some may take a little longer. And so we will be taking, I think a very disciplined view of expenses around every category, ranging from office space to, facilities to non people-related expenses, and also in terms of workforce. We are obviously hiring very few folks right now. And that’s predominantly because very few folks were trading we have extremely good retention of have team members at the moment, but we are not hiring out are not hiring very many when vacancies appear, so I do think expenses will be a more favorable story as we go through the back of the year but not ready to try to wrap any bookends around numbers as of yet. In terms of credit in the first and second question, I couldn’t tell if you met around other books that we thought were selling or not. If you did, I think the answer to that is we have no other plans at the moment to do anything like that or any dialogue with anyone but you obviously never say never but that’s not our intent. And then in terms of just credit in general. I mean, obviously, we tighten credit, certain sectors and Chris you want to go in any specifics on that?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Chris Ziluca</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, I mean, again, we are learning from a lot of the deferral activity and we are, utilizing some of that experience, to really tighten our underwriting guidance to The field into our credit officers. And, we have been focused for a while around making sure that the types of transactions that we are on boarding are, less chunky and sizable in nature. And certainly that sort of thought process continues. But overall, when we think about some of the sectors under focus that’s in the in the earnings release, we are, providing general guidance around just ensuring that existing accounts, meet our criteria, as well as any new relationships that we might be considering, with the idea that some of those sectors under focus are ones that we are going to be a little bit more selective and cautious about before we consider new opportunities. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Kevin, this is John. The page that Chris is referring to is on Page 16 of the investor deck and that’s a little bit of a more enhanced slide than the one we had last quarter where we had whole sectors, and for that slide, we divided it between the sub sectors in some cases even within the sub sector, and broke those into tears of concern. So you can somewhat say from that page, that the total book of loans that we have under the most intense look right now is a bit smaller than maybe what we talked about a quarter ago. And then I think, as we get towards the end of the year, instead of focused on sectors, we will be talking about individual credits. And so I think over the course of the next quarter, as the deferrals are completely retired, as we know what the credits are that end up needing modest modifications versus additional restructuring, than if we are going to see migrations. based on actual risk readings, and not just sectors under focus, but page 16, was intended to give a little bit more detail that was helpful, we thought for investors to understand what part of the book could be at the most risk or less risk. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Chris Ziluca</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And I will also just going to add to that, I mean, the reality is during the last earnings release, this was all fairly new, we were really, focused on broad categories. And over the past quarter, we have been able to kind of refine our understanding on such that in certain areas, and in certain situations, we have realized that maybe it’s slightly less of a concern. And then in other areas, we still have the same level of concern, and we are at the same level of intensity around managing those transactions and books of business. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Kevin, I think the last thing to add related to this question is, look I think we feel good about where we are in terms of the de risking activities we’ve done up to now. And there is nothing else out there. As John mentioned on the horizon as far as out we can see and we believe we have done a significant amount of de-risking and really looked forward to kind of a return to more or less a normal level of provisioning in the second half of the year. Now normal in this environment, it’s kind of a wildcard, but as best we can tell, we should be able to return to kind of a more normalized level of provisioning and that would also imply a level of profitability as well.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Kevin Fitzsimmons</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay, thanks very much, guys. That’s helpful.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">You bet. Thanks for the questions.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Our next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Casey Haire</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So, a follow-up question on the deferrals, the loans that are come – that are not carrying that are coming back for a second wave, is there a concentration from Slide 16 that you are seeing there like a pattern?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Chris Ziluca</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, I think what we are seeing in general is some of the hospitality related credits, hotel and restaurants are the ones, where the deferral has expired and we are in the process of essentially executing on the structured solution. I think that’s probably the most obvious pattern.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, Casey, this is John. I know you haven’t had a chance to see the whole deck and they just went out an hour ago or so. But if you look at Pages 12 through 15, that highlights those sub sectors that we mentioned on the far right, you will see where the deferral dollars and percentages are as of July 15. Now a caveat to that is we are in deferral maturity season right now, right. And so everyday, those numbers are coming down. And so when doing the comparative within the mid cap space, that date as of date really is meaningful. So ours is as of the 15 and each day those numbers come down a bit.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Casey Haire</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay, great. Yes, I think I will take a closer look. And then on the capital build, Mike I think you said you want to get back to your – you expect to get back to 8% TCE by year end. I mean, if we get a lot of forgiveness of PPP, you will be there at 7.89% ex-PPP plus you got lower provisioning coming post the divestiture. So, is there something that I’m missing? Do you expect loan growth to kind of bounce back here like what would – why would TCE not come back meaningfully given PPP’s forgiveness and less provisioning?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Achary</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">No, we absolutely think it will. You are right, if we just back out the PPP loans were at 7.89%. We have also talked about having a good deal of excess liquidity on the balance sheet that I think will largely subside by the end of the third quarter. So, that’s another dozen to 15 basis points. So look – I think we will be very disappointed if we are not back over 8% by year end.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Casey Haire</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay, great. And just one last one on the PPNR front, the service charges, I think, John and Mike, you guys said that those have come back later in the quarter. Is there a trend line that we can point to like June versus April just to get a better line of sight on the service charges?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">On service charges, it’s – I wish there was a simple answer, but it kind of depends on which charges we are talking about. So if you look at the hit from 2Q to 1Q, it’s a pretty big number of about $10 million pre-tax event number depending on how you count it 40% to 60% of the overall $10 million in reduction was really the presence and by stimulus I am talking about beneficial unemployment payments building, PPP deposits into business accounts, and just really what was early quarter of fear driven hoarding of cash. And so NSF OD charges and regular deposit maintenance account charges were dramatically down. So that was about half, I am going to call it 40% to 60% of the $10 million hit. Those will come back as deposit account balances normalize. Another million, maybe 1 or so were directly waived fees and those ended in July. And then the remainder would be in transaction-related fees that were very much diminished just when the economy was largely shutdown. And so those will be like annuity sales, loan fees that are not amortized, debit card volumes etcetera. So, both annuity and debit card balances have both no, we are not at normalized levels yet, but they have resumed more so in July than June. Time will tell whether that sticks around for the whole quarter, but it looks maybe pretty good right now particularly given the rate environment for annuities. And so that I think we will start seeing some return on 3Q. It’s very hard to project what the service and NSF OD income patterns will be, because it’s tied to the excess balances in the deposit accounts. So, without a place to deploy those funds, we don’t – we are not getting the type of finished income benefit you would get from that excess liquidity, right. So we are staying very liquid right now for that reason, because we do expect those deposit balances diminish as people begin to use the money. Totally different topic goes to secondary mortgage income, where that revenue which we thought would ease up a little bit more and 2Q did not and it continued booming right through the second quarter. And really through July so far has still remained stronger than we would have anticipated. How long that lasts? I don’t know, but it’s rate driven and there is a somewhat attractive percentage of first-time homebuyers beginning to get into the market probably due to the attractiveness right. So we will see how long that actually holds up. Does that help you out? Do you have help you or do you have any others you would like to – or any other?</p>

<p class="p p7">Our next question comes from Brad Milsaps with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.</p>

<p class="p p7">Hey, good evening guys.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Hi, Brad.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Achary</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Hi, Brad.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Brad Milsaps</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Mike, as I was curious if you can maybe comment on the charge-offs away from the energy sale, any particular sector that encompassed those charge-offs outside of what you had to take on the energy portfolio?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, I will start. This is John and Chris can add color if you like. When you get to non-energy charge offs, there were a small number of credits, some in the behavioral modification book, which is quite small. There was a fraud in a construction company. And several of those were somewhat in play before the pandemic began and there were some signs that we thought were pretty bright that they would be able to work through it and come back and actually do well. The pandemic took the wind out of that sale. And as a result, we opted to go ahead and proactively take those charges in 2Q. So, it really wasn’t any particular sector. It was more the inventory of credits that had some weaknesses that were maybe headed better that the pandemic eliminated and our opinion a chance of them actually recovering. And so that’s been dealt with. Anything to add to that, Chris?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Chris Ziluca</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">No, I think that’s a fair summation. Beyond that just the normal stuff that happens every quarter really haven’t seen a big uptick in like consumer losses or anything like that caused by the pandemic as of yet.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">No, I think also fair to say that again we took a proactive approach to dealing with issues, not that we have it in the past, but first half of the year that’s been our MO.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Brad Milsaps</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Got it. And then just back to the energy, so I am curious at what point, was this something that you guys contemplated early in the quarter, maybe earlier in the year when you are sort of going through your initial CFO estimates, just kind of curious kind of how it transpired and how it will impact your thoughts around provisioning going forward. I appreciate that it’s very difficult to predict, but do you guys know that you expect it to go lower? And then also just curious, any color you can give us on kind of marks in E&amp;P versus midstream versus service as you kind of went through the process, kind of what you saw in terms of what the market kind of demanded there?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, this is John. I will start and kind of tackle the first question. We have made no secret our desire we want to take down the energy concentration over course of time and I have successfully done that and the book really was improving. The – we were beginning to get towards the back of the year and I think I may have mentioned that on the call at some point that we were getting in a onesie, twosie offers, some of those we took, most of them, we didn’t. On individual credits, the discounts were not terribly attractive, because generally, these were credits that were already distressed that for whatever reason, a buyer was trying to accumulate debt for their own purposes. This transaction was the first opportunity to do something conclusive and a meaningful step towards a big de-risking maneuver and that really because of that and because the size of it and unfortunately drove the discount to be higher than I think what I’d like to see. But that was just our reality. So, in terms of discounting between books, when these portfolios come together generally just comes down to a number. I am sure there were individual numbers were very different on the other side, but we're not privy to that, and it'd be improper for us to discuss it even if it were. So I think if you just kind of look at the whole pool and look at there were certainly credits in that book that we expected zero loss from. There were credits that might have had material loss in it and so by the time you read them all together, you get a number we viewed as where our current expected losses may be, if our darker scenarios came to provision and then the other opportunity to exit it all right now. And redirect those resources and the company’s focus towards business we want to grow versus shrink. And that led to the decision. Anything else you want? </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Chris Ziluca</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, just briefly, but yes, little bit about the process, Brad, and I mean look this is something certainly we have thought about overtime, as we have gone through the process of reducing our cancer concentration pretty substantially over the past few years, and a number of factors, I think came together in the second quarter, that brought us to the conclusion to, to kind of initiate a process. And that’s what we did. We had multiple individual firms that were, involved in taking a look at the book. And in the end, we received multiple bids. And, it was fairly competitive. And we were pleased really with how the process played out. And as John indicated, typically in a process like this, you are not going to get folks to differentiate, their pricing, by credit or even by segment of the book. So for the most part, it was really a portfolio sale with portfolio level pricing, hope that helps.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Brad Milsaps</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes, no, that’s great. And if any additional color Mike on you addressed this a little better we just get a magnitude of provisioning or yes I know there is so many unknowns, but just any additional color would be – would you offer there?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Achary</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes, I mean, it’s really hard to put a number on that. So we are not going to go there in that regard. But suffice to say that, again, we have really kind of completed the de risking that we thought was necessary in the first half of the year. And we look for a return to a much more normalized level of provisioning, both in the third and the fourth quarter. What that is, will depend on a number of different factors. But I think that, we have built reserves substantially and don’t really at this point, look at or out looking at building reserves, too much beyond where we are now. </p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Hey, Brad, this is John. The only thing I would add in just staring at numbers, NPLs are now down 33% and criticized commercial down 34%. The deferral percentages are obviously significantly reduced. And then the ones that don’t come back to normal payment will migrate to an answer, probably to the end of the year. And I think we will all know a lot about what that has been but the one big wildcard that I think none of us really know is what direction does the economy go. And that has a big impact from an ACL perspective as we apply different scenarios, right. So if it seems as if the resurgent infection rate has not led to the somewhat knee-jerk, reaction of close everything, and that is much more measured this time around. If that continues, then I think the futures maybe a little more brighter. If we end up with massive closures, then that would be a little more tough but all things equal in the current posture we are at, you would certainly expect provision to decrease meaningfully</p>

<p class="p p9">Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Ebrahim Poonawala</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Hey, guys. So most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just one follow-up I guess on the energy book, why not sell the entire book, John, why we kept the remaining $350 million? I am just wondering given it seems like you just wanted to remove the tail risk if oil went lower. So you kind of sold it at the best price you could get so that you don’t have to worry about this the impact on stock is diminished. So why not sell the entire book John?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">This is John. I will start the honest answer is when you get into the very small credits, the appetite for a buyer is very low. When you get into credits that you have, $300,000 balance, $500,000 balance just not a lot of appetite. So, on the larger end, the few remaining large credits we have. And when you are fairly far down the road in a workout situation, it can become problematic to include one of those credits in a portfolio sale. And so those items that were meaningfully close to a resolution, one way or the other, it’s better to leave those alone. And then the rest was just very, very small. And there was also a large number of accounts that they have a zero balance right now there is no real incentive for a buyer to buy zero balance at zero right and just take the remaining commitment. So that’s the reason.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Achary</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. And Ebrahim, just to add a little bit of color to John’s points, on the book that we sold, the average size of the relationship was about $11.3 million and we sold about 44 relationships. In terms of what’s left, the average size of the relationship is only about $670,000 and it’s well over 240 different relationships. So what we have left is extremely granular. And again, to John’s point, I am not sure if there was much of an appetite by folks to acquire that granular of a portfolio and we should also call out there were two credits that were not passed right? So, it was a better performing book.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Chris Ziluca</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes. And the vast majority of what’s left is really kind of bilateral relationships. So, these are true customers and much of what we sold was a syndicated book.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Ebrahim Poonawala</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Got it. And what Mike, remind us what’s the SNC book at the end of the quarter, I get a good view on just the energy norms?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Achary</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes. Our total SNC book about $1.8 billion, so again, our concentration in SNCs is down pretty substantially pre-sale versus post-sale. So, post-sale, it’s about what 8.5% before that it was about 10.5% near 11%.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Ebrahim Poonawala</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Got it. Thanks for taking my question.</p>

<p class="p p10">Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Jennifer Demba</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Thank you. I just wonder if you could give us some color on the mortgage pipeline as it stands now, just wondering what kind of revenue impact you are expecting in the second half of the year and how much momentum is carried?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">That’s a terrific question. The first one is easier to answer than the second. But the first one, the pipeline is still full. In fact, just this morning, we were looking at the pipeline and it’s still so full for refi that it’s somewhat getting in the way of working with portfolio relationships that while they are not quick revenue that they are valuable. And so our dialogue was do we need to peel off any resources to focus on the primarily private banking portfolio that we expect to retain. And so the pipeline is still very full. In terms of revenue second half, all things being equal you would expect secondary mortgage to be similar in 3Q to 2Q if that holds up. But I will confess to you, I am really surprised, Jennifer, I didn’t expect there to be that much more refi business out there, but it just keeps on coming. And so, we are glad to take it. So, I think 3Q ought to look like 2Q, if that pipeline stays where it is right now. Full quarter is a little too far to think out there, but sadly, I don’t think we are going to see rates going up really in the near-term, but they are just – you would think it would be an end to the refi business the bonds were actually producing.</p>

<p class="p p10">Our next question comes from Matt Olney with Stephens. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Matt Olney</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just want to go back to the asset sale and I think most of us have been assuming that the midstream assets are lower risk and therefore midstream assets have lower loss content. Would you agree with that assessment of midstream assets? And I guess the RBL assets they will make sense given some of the losses there just trying to reconcile that the midstream sale? Thanks.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">This is John. It’s a good question. That is a business historically that has done very well. But what – if you look at a forecast and these things ripple, right, so if you see a lot of pressure on RBL, then you began or at least you could begin to see more pressure on contract rates for transport and storage on the midstream side. To-date, I think, Chris, if I am right, there was only one significant concern in that book. But as you begin to look forward, if we are right or if we began to see a darker scenario there, we could end up with problems in the midstream remaining book and so made the call to do a much more broader exit of energy in total. And the fact that those were syndications without co-relationships, man, it followed the pattern we have been following in terms of managing more towards more granularity and more full service relationships. And so that is really why I was included was downside risk potential and the lack of offsetting liquidity. </p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Matt Olney</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Okay, that makes sense. Thank you for that. And then shifting over to loan balances. If I exclude the TPP impact and the energy both long tail it looks like loan balances were still down sequentially. And you mentioned the previous blind draws were paid down. Just curious where you think loan balances go from here, and if credit is tightening in a certain segments that you mentioned before, should we assume that loan balances continue to contract from here ex-PPP?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">It’s a good observation. And I think the headwinds do not appear or do appear stronger than the tailwinds in the very near term. And I mean forgive me for doing anecdotes on you. But I think they are applicable. First in terms of just attrition from the portfolio, other than amortizations, we are seeing very, very little attrition in the book i.e. customers that are out pricing, existing debt. Clients appear to be more hunkered down. The downside to that -- I mean that's the upside, that we see less runoff relative to prior quarters in the book, particularly the commercial book, The downside to it is, is the same thing is happening everywhere else. And so there’s just not as much deal flow available. So it’s hard to tell is that hunkering down, and clients who are for whatever reason or out of are unhappy where they are, but they are not willing to take the chance of moving to a new bank, or is it just straight up like demand because business sentiment is poor. It’s hard to tell exactly why but the bottom line is demand is very light. And so as we look towards Q3, while we do have pipelines, they don’t look that bad. In fact, the pipeline for the end of 2Q is the same as the pipeline for the end of 2Q last year, and that doesn’t correlate with that demand scenario. But as we move through that pipeline, the credit risk appetite in sectors, under focus begin to apply. And we I think the pull-through rate is going to be much lower for the third cue pipeline than it was for third cue last year. I gave you a lot of information there. But there is a whole lot of anecdotals that points to less - light attrition but much lighter demand and with the secondary refinance activity causing diminishment the mortgage portfolio coupled with a runoff of the indirect books which we are not replacing a couple with our appetite being a little tighter on the home equity line side and at the upper end, and certainly with syndications being more tight than that would suggest to further shrinkage in the third quarter before begin to see increases loan balance sheet going forward. The only other wildcard I will put in there is some of the PPP balances apparently went to paying down existing debt because the recovery didn’t happen as quickly as people thought. And so with no expenses to use the PPP balances to barn they just went to pay it off other debt in the short term, as though as the reopening occurred, we began to see some of that come back, but only very, very recently. And so it’s really tough to give you up. But we are not going to give any guidance because the guidance would be too much of a guess versus an informed decision. But I would just end it with saying the headwinds are outweighing the tailwinds for the near term. </p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Matt Olney</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Okay, that’s very helpful. Thank you, guys.</p>

<p class="p p11">Okay.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Our next question comes from Catherine Mealor with KBW. Your line is now open.</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Catherine Mealor</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Thanks and good evening everyone. Question on CECL, I noticed that you are waiting between the baseline and the various scenarios changed from last quarter. Last quarter, you were 80% baseline and then 20% of the two severe scenarios and then looks like now you are at 50% baseline and then 25% actually a better scenario and then 25%, just a slower growth scenario? It seems at least your baseline is more optimistic, just any kind of commentary on your thought process there?</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Mike Achary</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Sure, Catherine. This is Mike. I’d be glad to comment on that. So, yes, you stated the other various mixes between first and second quarter accurately. And I guess the thing I would point out is the mix that we use in the first quarter was pretty detrimental and as you recall, as the first quarter was proceeding, the various Moody scenarios got kind of darker and darker as we went through that quarter. They also continue to get a little darker as we went through the second quarter. Although now that we are in the third quarter and have had a chance to look at the July scenarios, they seem to be stabilizing in a bit. So, the reasoning for why, we changed the mix a little bit, I think has everything to do with some of the comments John made earlier about, our regional economies opening and probably, I think, on balance doing fairly well. There's also the prospect of additional stimulus out there over the next quarter or so. And so that played into our thinking as well. But I think on balance, we really look at the two kind of together. And then we look at the result of how much we built our reserve, and where we stand now and feel that we are in a pretty good place all things considered.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">And Catherine, it’s John. The only thing I would add is as we look across our footprint, there are pronounced differences and the degree of recovery already experienced market-to-market and just using something as simple as hotel occupancy, average daily rate and revenue per available room, RevPAR, the relativity between markets is extremely different. And so we have seen a lot of questions around New Orleans and the pressure in the city is primarily around the lack of convention and tradeshow business. But as you get to other markets, particularly the beachy markets, the beach facing markets, in some cases, unbelievably, the numbers are only like 10%, 15% off of where they were a year ago. And so that also plays into the snare differences, trying to drop the net around the whole footprint with both good and bad relative to baseline experiences.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Catherine Mealor</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Okay, that makes sense and helpful. And then my only follow-up is just on the deferral conversation. If they are going to quantify the balance of loans that are now off deferral, so we didn’t take the second round, but they are undergoing some kind of structured solution and then where would we see that balance of loans in terms of loan grades?</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Chris Ziluca</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">So, I will take a quick run at that. It’s Chris Ziluca.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Catherine Mealor</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Hey, Chris.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Chris Ziluca</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">The – if you look at where we peeked in the way of deferrals and where we report kind of the 715 numbers. I think Page 10 really kind of articulates that. We peaked at $3.6 billion. We are down to $1.4 billion. So, the net obviously is kind of what’s run off, the $2.2 billion that have kind of run off. I think we also indicated earlier that, we are seeing two-thirds to three quarters of our loans essentially going back to repayment. So, you can assume from that, that the remaining amount are the ones that we are actively discussing or continuing to discuss, second deferrals, but really more steering them towards a discussion around whether or not a second deferral is really sufficient or whether or not a structured solution is probably the better way to go. And it's a mix of both of those. I wouldn't say that, that they are all going to go to a second deferral, situation, some are just needing an additional month or two to kind of get them to what they feel and what we feel, is a little bit more stabilized operating rhythm. But, from there, then, we start to explore, risk ratings, and the risk rating migration related there too into the extent that the structures that we are talking about what our customers, would indicate that, we should be looking at potentially downgrading those credits, some of which may be just downgraded kind of within past and some might be moving to watch or some sort of special mention substandard category. We will probably see some migration in that regard. And I think we have talked about this, we did certainly talk about it earlier last month, you know, in one of our investor presentations, where the reality is that the migration discussion is more of a second half of 2020 as you start to really truly assess the longer term impact of the pandemic on those individual credits and the structures that you might need to put in place to bridge that gap. We think it’s all pretty manageable at this point in time based on the dialogue that I am having with our relationship managers and portfolio managers. But I do expect to see some migration in risk rating across the board, you know, across our risk rating spectrum, in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Kevin, it’s John. I know that there is so much detail. It’s really kind of hard to find a theme. So I will do my best to encapsulate some of that for you. When we filed the inner part of the intra-quarter 8-K back in late June, the guidance that we gave – it really wasn’t guidance, it was just a statement of where we were, it looks like something a little better than 50%, we are going to return to normal payment. And that was early. That number got up to where it looked more like two-thirds a few weeks later and now it’s two-thirds to 75%. So the trajectory of our expectations in return to normal payment has certainly gotten better over the course of time. That said, it’s not done and August 10 is the last big tranche of deferral maturities. So we will have been through all of those initial 90-day deferrals by the second week of August and then by the second week of September, we would have passed 30 days on all of the return to pay deferral dispositions. So, when Chris says through the end of the second half, it’s – there are prescriptive times, where I think we will have a lot more information around sort of what those themes turn out to be. So, the purpose of giving all the details in Slides 10 through 16 was to provide the market as much detail as we have to support and explain the reason we are maybe a little bit more optimistic than we were a few weeks ago. Now, time will tell right. We have got a long way to go, I think as an industry to know really what the pandemic impact is going to be. But those would be the broad themes that may be helpful for you.</p>

<p class="p p13">And then so within that, did you provide in the deck and I am positive I didn’t see it, the update for watch list loans? And was there a big change in watch list credits quarter-over-quarter?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">I think we gave the commercial criticized numbers back on Slide 8 and 9 is the NPL change and the criticized change. It’s broken probably for the last time between energy and non-energy.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Catherine Mealor</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Okay. But in terms of watch with the big inflow at least to watch?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Chris Ziluca</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Yes. We didn’t really disclose all of that, but clearly, you know, we are pretty actively monitoring all of our credits. And so like I indicated, I mean, there has been some migration, some of the migration that we are seeing is kind of pre-COVID normal stuff that you would see and some of it is categorical. What I would say is, is that we did move you know in Q1 all of our RBL and midstream credits into watch category. So you are actually going to see probably a net reduction in watch as a result of the loan sale, but it’s a pretty active and fluid process.</p>

<p class="p p13">Thanks very much.

Is there still a hiring reps that can happen as well as sort of new business generation that is in the near term?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Yes, this is John. Thanks, Chris for questions. It’s nice to talk about revenue. It’s fun. We have hired one team. We won’t get into where the team came from with some good early progress made. That said, it seems like it was 4, 5 years ago, we actually had that conversation so much has happened since then. So I think it would be safe to say and I will break it apart, we have a number of technology initiatives that while they are about a quarter behind, where we earlier thought they would be, because we directed all the resources to support the automated solutions for PPP funding and forgiveness. Those are back on the track about a quarter behind. And those will make a meaningful difference both in effectiveness and efficiency in the sales process as we get to the end of the year into ‘21. So that is continued and we talked about that pre-pandemic. Secondly, we are absolutely in the market to hire good talent and those more granular parts of the loan and our balance sheet. And should those opportunities come up, we will certainly pursue them. So I think what we are saying is we would look for workforce efficiency in areas that are not revenue diminishing and we are willing and have the appetite and capacity to add resources that will make a meaningful positive difference in revenue.</p>

<p class="p p13">Great. That’s helpful. And is there any ship in expenses as a result of that or can that kind of work in your kind of what you were expecting on spending?</p>

<p class="p p14">In both of those two items I just mentioned?</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="question">Christopher Marinac</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Right.</p>
<p class="p p14"><strong><span class="answer">John Hairston</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p14">Yes, this time – by this time, I thought we would probably be able to talk a lot more about that, but so much has changed. And there is so much volatility that at this point, I think we need to let kind of pandemic related expenses settle some and then we will talk more about those impacts as we get later in the year when things settle down and we will do it in terms of ‘21 versus ‘20.</p>
