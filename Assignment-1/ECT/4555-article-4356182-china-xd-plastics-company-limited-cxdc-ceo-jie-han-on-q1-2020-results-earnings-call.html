<p class="p p1">[Foreign Language] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, China's auto industry was hit hard with production and sales decreased by 45.2% and 42.4%, respectively for the first quarter of 2020. The Company's manufacturing facilities in Harbin and Sichuan were temporarily shut down in February and March 2020, while our Dubai facilities' operation has been suspended since early February 2020, pursuant to the local government directives.</p>

<p class="p p2">During the first quarter of 2020, the Company's revenue decreased by 52%, and our domestic sales decreased by 51.1% in all regions, as compared to the same period of the last year. The Company has taken proactive measures to respond to these changes from the supply disruption and the decreased orders of auto industry.</p>
<p class="p p2">We continued to promote sales of high-priced semi-finished goods in domestic market during the first quarter of 2020. We are pleased to see an overall increase of 65.6% in the average RMB selling price of our products, to partially offset the decreased sales volume of 70%.</p>
<p class="p p2">[Foreign Language] Meanwhile, China XD has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by producing raw materials for PPE such as goggles and masks, to help alleviate the pandemic to our communities and mitigate the negative impact of world pandemic on Chinese auto industry.</p>
<p class="p p2">[Foreign Language] We also resumed our commitment to completing our industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics by the end of third quarter of this year, and our Qinling Road Project and Jiangnan Road Project for equipment upgrade and factory revamping by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, thus bringing the production capacity in Heilongjiang Campus back to 390,000 metric tons.</p>
<p class="p p2">At the same time, we expect to complete additional 10 production lines in our Sichuan plant by the end of the fourth quarter of this year, thus to bring the total capacity of Sichuan base to 300,000 metric tons.</p>
<p class="p p2">Together with the production capacity ramp up in Dubai, we are confident in our ability to make further inroads into more specialized high-end products for various applications in more other markets.</p>
<p class="p p2">[Foreign Language] We will continue to optimize our management structure and enhance our operating efficiency. We are confident, through our cooperation with Chinese big banks to successfully execute our expansion strategy in multiple regions and sectors, and to be confident with our core market positioning and expanded platform for growth.</p>
<p class="p p2">[Foreign Language] With that, I would now turn the call over to Taylor Zhang, our CFO to walk you through our financials. Taylor?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Taylor Zhang</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Thank you, Mr. Han. Thank you, Shaojie and thank you everyone for joining the call today. Before I review the numbers, let me remind you that all figures I discuss are for the reporting period, the first quarter of 2020 unless I state otherwise. Additionally, any year-over-year comparison is to the first quarter of 2019 and any sequential comparison is to the fourth quarter of 2019.</p>

Revenues were $144.8 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $156.7 million, or 52%, compared to $301.5 million in the period of last year. This was due to the decrease of 70% in sales volume, 5.5% negative impact from exchange rate due to depreciation of RMB against US dollars, partially offset by an increase of 65.6% in the average RMB selling price of our products, as compared to those of the same period of last year.</p>
