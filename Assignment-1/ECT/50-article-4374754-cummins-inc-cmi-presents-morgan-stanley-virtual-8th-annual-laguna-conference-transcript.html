<p class="p p1"><strong>Courtney Yakavonis</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning, everyone. I'm Courtney Yakavonis, the US machinery analyst at Morgan Stanley. Next up, we have Cummins with us. But before we begin, please note that this webcast is for Morgan Stanley's clients and appropriate Morgan Stanley employees only. The webcast is not for members of the press. If you are a member of the press, please disconnect and reach out separately. For important disclosures, please see Morgan Stanley's research disclosure website at www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. And if you have any questions, please reach out to your Morgan Stanley sales representative. </p>
<p class="p p1">So as many of you know, Cummins is a manufacturer of engines across the various different end markets in both on-highway and off-highway as well as aftermarket components and distribution. I'm very pleased to have with us this morning James Hopkins and Matt Rush from the Investor Relations team. James and Matt, thank you so much for joining us virtually today.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, James, I believe you have some brief opening remarks and then we will open it up to Q&amp;A. For those of you who are joining us via webcast, I would encourage you to submit your questions via the ask questions box on the portal. So, James, go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>James Hopkins</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Hey. Good morning, everybody. And thanks, Courtney, for the invite, really happy to be here. This is our second year in attendance this year virtually, a little bit different than last year, but happy to be able to participate -- participate again this year. So just sort of a little brief comment to start with I think is many people are more than aware the challenging first half of the year in many of our end markets whether that's due to COVID or some cyclical declines in some of our end markets, particularly North America truck that were starting to occur before COVID hit.</p>
<p class="p p1">Given the decline in revenues that we experienced in the first half of the year, feel very good about the profits that we're able to bring to the bottom line, and lots of different things to help support that. We announced the restructuring plan in late last year in preparation for some kind of cyclical downturns in North America. We also implemented some temporary cost reduction actions as the impact of COVID became clear.</p>
<p class="p p1">As we look forward, we are seeing improvement in most of our end markets, particularly North America truck. And then looking further down the line, feel very confident about our competitive position opportunities our market share gains, growth related to emissions content, and of course, some of the new technologies we're investing in and how we can leverage those whether it's battery electric, fuel cell or electrolyzer technology.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Courtney Yakavonis</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. So maybe if we can just start off talking about production trends, I think ACT was out this morning with the latest build rates but you've been talking about how you've seen the cross [ph] OEMs successfully increased build rates back to pre-COVID levels.</p>
<p class="p p1">So can you just give us an update on are you -- what are you seeing in terms of build rates on your off-highway markets? And on the on-highway side, have you seen any improvement or have they been pretty stable with those Feb-March levels?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">James Hopkins</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yeah. Absolutely, as you mentioned. On the on-highway space specific to North America, the industry's been producing for a couple of months now right around 20,000 units which in essence, is very similar to the levels that we were being produced in February and March, so pre-COVID. At the same time, industry orders have also kind of hovered around that 20,000 unit level supporting that level of production.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Outside of the on-highway market, the off-highway market, do you have some slightly different dynamics? I'll kind of highlight a couple of them. So on the construction side, I would say recovery has been more slow which we've kind of talked about that a little bit on our second quarter earnings call. And that's partly due to the fact that we had a significant amount of equipment purchased over the last couple of years.</p>
<p class="p p2">And so those markets were already starting to weaken in the second half of 2019, continue to be weak pre-COVID in the first quarter. And so we still have some kind of more cyclical things to work through, I think before we see meaningful growth on the construction side of things, both in the United States and in Europe. </p>
<p class="p p2">We also participate in mining markets. And so for us that's an important piece of the portfolio within our Power Systems segment. We had seen weakness in mining market, certain portions of mining market, again, before COVID, primarily coal-related end market which represent about 50% of our exposure in that space. So that kind of weakened into the first quarter of this year, remains quite weak into the second quarter, and we still do not see much sign of improvement on the coal-elated piece of the mining portfolio. </p>
<p class="p p2">On the other hand, the other 50% more related to copper iron ore, gold extraction. Demand in that space has remained relatively stable over the last year. Haven't seen many changes there. Certainly haven't seen meaningful changes in the last three or four months regardless of the change in commodity prices in that space going up quite significantly. So, not unusual for those off-highway market. And then others, we participate in such as power generation to take a little bit longer to recover versus the truck markets which tend to be a little bit earlier cycle. But that's kind of how we see those end markets today, clearly still a lot of uncertainty in the market given the situation with COVID. But that's kind of how we see things today given the current situation. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">And on the North American truck cycle, I think you guys had at your Analyst Day back in November suggested that we would start to see an uptick at the beginning of 2021. ACT has begun to raise their build estimates now. Do you have a strong view on ACT's forecast? And based on what you're seeing, how optimistic are you for the recovery? I think Don and Richard yesterday said that they think we could see next year, kind of back to the 10-year average?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">James Hopkins</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yeah. I think it's too early for us to kind of provide any kind of specific guidance for next year on that. But as in prior cycles, there's certain things that we'll look at to kind of determine how we anticipate demand in future quarters into next year. So, we've seen an improvement in freight rates. That is supportive of fleets purchasing more trucks. We continue to see new trucks with better fuel economy, improves safety systems, drivability with automated manual transmissions, that do provide some incentive for people to replace their older trucks with new trucks. </p>
<p class="p p2">Of course, really important for many people that there's an ability to sell their old truck as they trade in. The used truck market has improved a little bit in terms of quantity of trucks being able to get sold, and at least a stabilization in the prices that people are able to get for the used truck. But the prices are still meaningfully below where they were a year or two years ago. So the metrics seem to be moving in the right direction, still a lot of uncertainty out there. But certainly, metrics moving in the right direction that could suggest an improvement in demand over the medium term.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Got you. Maybe moving over to China, clearly has been recovering much faster than the rest of the world. You called out heavy duty and medium duty truck to man up over 50% and US where your sales up over 50%. So how are you thinking about this recent strength and how sustainable it is? And any thoughts on government stimulus over there?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">James Hopkins</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yeah. Absolutely. So Q2 was an incredible quarter for our business in China. We had record revenues, record profitability, almost every market we participated in was at record levels. In the truck market specifically, the annualized demand for trucks in Q2 was 2.3 million units. I think the highest ever full year demand for trucks in China is 1.4 million, so you can see just how incredibly high demand was.</p>
<p class="p p3">Part of the strength in the truck market and also the construction market, just our other primary market in China, were certainly driven by catch up from industry shutdowns in the first quarter but we also did see some stimulus-like measures that we think have augmented the demand in the second quarter and also running into the third quarter.</p>
<p class="p p3">One of the items that we've kind of highlighted in relation to that is on the truck side of things that there's been a push to scrap some of the older national Standard III emission level trucks out in the field. So those trucks now are several years old. And in essence, in some regions, you’ve seen regulation put into place, which means that folks can't drive those trucks on the highway or into the city, in essence, creating demand for new trucks in the marketplace. </p>
<p class="p p3">Our estimate is that some of that scrapping of older trucks this year has resulted in incremental demand of -- somewhere in the range of 250,000 to 300,000 units, a pretty sizable number. And that certainly kind of void the market. Unclear how that will continue into 2021. Not something that I think that I have a good enough crystal ball -- a crystal ball to kind of figure out. What I will say though as we go forward into China next year, we do have some nonmarket-based opportunities in terms of growth.</p>
<p class="p p3">So the rest of -- the portion of the country that isn't new emission standards and a VI level will move to those levels next July. That will provide us an opportunity to increase sales of our aftertreatment systems to help folks meet those regulations. The annualized impact of that is around $300 million a year. And we'll continue to increase selling our transmissions -- our Eaton-Cummins joint venture. So we're planning to sell about 1,000 of those transmissions this year in China. I expect that to increase meaningfully going into next year, which will also provide a revenue bump not related to market size. </p>
<p class="p p3">We're also hopeful that as we introduced our NSVI product into the market, we have over 10 years of experience with similar levels of emissions whether it's in the United States or Europe and so we feel our product portfolio and our offering to customers in China will be pretty compelling. And so hopefully, we will see some market share increases as people take on board these new powertrain portfolios and see really good performance on them.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">I think that’s helpful. Maybe moving on India, much different story over there, you’ve mentioned that nearly all of the company’s end markets are extremely challenged. Have you seen any signs of stabilization in this market? And what do you think is really going to take for this region to recover relative to other regions? And I believe there's also some emissions regulations opportunities over there, so has that timeline shifted at all?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">James Hopkins</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. So really challenging conditions in India, which frankly started before COVID, starting in the middle of last year, we started to see the negative impacts of low credit availability in the truck market in India where the majority of customers are owner operators and essentially look to finance their purchase through the shadow banking organizations. And the ability of folks to do that really dried up. </p>
<p class="p p3">So we saw negative impacts of trucking kind of starting last year in Q3 and then we started to see that trickledown effect into Q4 in construction markets as construction of new buildings kind of started to slow down as people weren't able to get financing for construction. And then we saw it flow through to power generation in the first quarter of this year as you can imagine, less new buildings being put up and so less backup gen sets.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">So the situation in India was very challenging before we even got the additional challenge of COVID in the second quarter. So still rough today, the credit challenges with the industries we participate in or facing remain, it's still very challenging to get credit and to finance a new truck or piece of construction equipment or building a new building, and that is impacting our end markets negatively. </p>
<p class="p p4">I think as we look forward, that availability of credit will be critical to helping support the market and getting a little bit of growth out of India. We're confident that over time that will happen and when it does, we'll perform exceptionally well. We have very high market share positions across industries in India. We've been doing business in India since the 1960s. And on top of being able to leverage that strong market share, we'll also leverage the new emissions regulations that you mentioned.</p>
<p class="p p4">So, the industry there, the truck industry did move to these new emissions in April of this year. And so, when the truck market returns, the annualized impact of those regulations on our revenue was about $300 million, similar to the number I referenced in China. So, very challenging right now. But as we look forward when the markets do recover, and I think we'll perform quite handsomely in India over time.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">In your opening comments you mentioned some of the cost actions that you started at in November of last year. And then you obviously took the incremental $25 million of temporary cost savings. So can you just comment on that and how confident you are that you can achieve that 25% decremental framework in the second half of this year? And anything we should be thinking about as we think about incremental margins in 2021 and how those will be impacted by some of these costs coming back in?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">James Hopkins</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. So for several years now, we've provided this framework on margins where we see incremental decrementals in this 20% to 25% range. To the extent that we fall out of that range, either with our actual results or with any kind of guidance, you should expect us to kind of explain why that may be. And then the first half of the year, we’ve kind of been in that range.</p>
<p class="p p4">We don't have official guidance for the second half of the year, given the uncertainty in our markets. And so how we've been really framing the second half of the year is discussing how it may change from the second quarter results that we have and really viewing it sequentially.</p>
<p class="p p4">So the items we've really highlighted from a sequential perspective are kind of as follows. So we had very, very strong warranty performance in the first half of the year. In Q2, our warranty as a percent of sales was 1.9%. An average performance for us on warranty is more like 2.5%, and so all else being equal, we would expect a little bit of a headwind from Q2 levels on warranty from 1.9% to say 2.5%.</p>
<p class="p p4">Other item we mentioned was joint venture income. So China was incredibly strong in the second quarter and we participate in China in many ways through joint ventures, so very hydrant joint venture income in the quarter. So to the extent that China's cooling into the third quarter, we'll see a little bit of a hit to the joint venture income in China.</p>
<p class="p p4">On top of that, we talked about research and development. So in the second quarter, a lot of our employees for an extended period of time were not able to get into our technical centers and so our spending on research and development activities was below where we would have liked it to be. That is not money that we were looking to save, that is an investment that we're looking to make to improve product quality, develop new products, improve fuel economy, things of that nature. So we are looking to catch up some of that spend. And so you'll see an increase in research and development from Q2 to Q3.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">And so those are kind of the general headwinds sequentially that we expect. And then all of that we’ll be looking to see to the extent we can offset it with volume. </p>
<p class="p p5">So we mentioned in our Q2 earnings call that we expect Q2 to be the bottom of revenues for the year. We expect improvements across our markets. We’ve historically done quite nicely at getting a volume leverage when we see increases in net sales. And so that will be what we look to try and offset those cost headwinds into the third quarter.</p>
<p class="p p5">As we look to the fourth quarter, the other thing to keep in mind is that we will see the temporary salary reductions that began in April and run through the third quarter. Those will end. And so from Q3 to Q4 we'll have a headwind of about $90 million from resuming the salaries back to their normal levels. </p>
<p class="p p5">In terms of next year, full-year 2020 versus 2021, the items I think to keep most in mind are going to be those temporary salary reductions. So those would have totaled about $165 million this year in the second and third quarter. So that will be a year-over-year headwind from a cost perspective.</p>
<p class="p p5">Given the challenging markets we're facing this year, our variable pay will be below a base payout this year. And so from 2020 to 2021 you're talking in the range of $200 million of likely incremental cost on the variable pay. Those are really kind of the two big numbers.</p>
<p class="p p5">Then, of course, we'll see how volumes come out for next year. We'll look to leverage that as much as possible to improve our margin cycle over cycle. And we'll continue to make improvements in our distribution business. Remember well we're kind of in the middle of the transformation process in distribution here in North America, which will bring sustained improved performance to that business unit from an EBITDA percent perspective.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Great. That's helpful. Maybe moving on to alterative power trains, you've obviously been making a lot of investments in your new power division in both battery electric and hydrogen but can you just talk maybe at a high level, your views around how electric and hydrogen will be adopted? How early you think it's possible to see in certain geographies and truck categories?</p>
<p class="p p5">And then, you've also kind of mentioned that you could be a potential beneficiary during the transition period as OEMs might rethink the amount that they want to invest in diesel, have you seen any evidence of OEMs kind of giving some of their R&amp;D to Cummins versus making the investments themselves?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">James Hopkins</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yeah. Who wants to cover on that one? So I think on the -- I'll do my best and if I forget anything, we can recircle back. So on the new technologies, our position has been pretty consistent over the last year, since our last Analyst Day, that we expect adoption of these new technologies to take time and we expect it to vary by region and application, whether that's true, whether it's battery electric, whether it's fuel cell. So it will take time. These are industries which have pretty sophisticated business models that have been worked out over many, many decades.</p>
<p class="p p5">And so I think our view is that the likelihood is we'll take small steps to understand the technology, how it works in applications and then to the extent that business models need to be adjusted that will need to be worked on, so slow and steady over time.</p>
<p class="p p5">From a technology perspective, we, as you mentioned, have been investing in the building blocks that will allow us to participate in that space. So, the last couple of years, we've made some acquisitions on the battery electric side. We have full battery electric systems today. Got over 200 buses running around North America with full Cummins fully battery electric systems in them, both from a school bus and the transit bus side. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">We've also invested significantly in hydrogen. And so the hydrogen, we've got both fuel cell technology, PEM fuel cells. But we also have access and ownership of electrolyzer technology. So essentially the piece of equipment that takes electricity and then produces hydrogen. That's an area that's very interesting to us.</p>
<p class="p p6">I think we see meaningful opportunities in that space as we see increased interest in green grid balancing, and potentially changing the current hydrogen utilization that we see today from gray hydrogen to green hydrogen, positively impacting the environment.</p>
<p class="p p6">So, lots of interesting kind of investments that we're making and different technologies that we think provide us this building walk that allows us to participate in these markets as they develop. And as I mentioned, we are doing that. So early adoption markets, buses, with battery electric, we're there today. On fuel cells, we have two fuel cell trains running in Europe. On electrolyzers, we're in the process of building out the world's largest PEM green electrolyzer up in Bécancour, Canada with our partner Aerodaki [ph]. So, lots of interest. We're there today, we'll be there tomorrow. </p>
<p class="p p6">And through this investment cycle as you mentioned, we still think we're going to see meaningful growth within our core business. Whether that's items that we’ve kind of leveraged over the last 10 years or increased emissions content on diesel vehicles, outgrowth of our parts business, growth within our transmission business and then market share growth, where over time, we see opportunities to assist OEMs if they decide to allow Cummins to help supply them more engines than we do today.</p>
<p class="p p6">And we've certainly seen some moves in the right direction from an availability prospectus over the last year, very much excited to see our X12 engine become available in regional haul application here in North America. I'm excited to have our engine available at max new medium-duty truck in North America and then in a couple of years, we'll be supplying medium-duty engines for Mahindra in the truck market in India, and some after treatments for Ashok Leyland already in India. So some nice customer announcements there which I think show the strength of our current product today and the desire for customers to use Cummins power and components.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Great. That was a good overview. Maybe just one on hydrogen, I think you've mentioned historically that you think it's more viable at this point in trains versus trucking. So can you just kind -- obviously, you have the two trains with Alstom running currently. But can you just talk about the hurdles to hydrogen truck adoptions versus train and how you think about the timelines there?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">James Hopkins</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yeah. Absolutely. So one of the compelling reasons why you're seeing a bit of interest in trains is that frankly the hydrogen fuel cell trains or the least cost greenway to go forward. So if you’re looking to reduce your environmental footprint, which is certainly a priority across Europe, you really have two options with your trains. You can either electrify lines that haven't been electrified where kind of trains still run today that are diesel and that's very, very expensive, millions and millions of dollars per mile to electrify the lines.</p>
<p class="p p6">Alternatively, you could put a hydrogen train on the line, more expensive than a diesel train but significantly less expensive than the electrifying portion of your network that you haven’t already electrified. So a bit of a unique case there but there's a kind of some of the courts we will probably see in some markets around where we see early adoption.</p>
<p class="p p6">On the fuel cell side related to trucks, some of the barriers to entry and things that need to be overcome there, we kind of talked a little bit about broadly last year at our Analyst Day, so infrastructure is certainly one cost, it’s certainly one durability of technology is one, I think we have a path to get there.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">But the expectation is that a truck will run 1 million miles with really no issues and a truck is much more heavily utilized than say a passenger cars and so ensuring that the technology is reliable and durable for these applications. These are some of the things that we continue to work on at Cummins and I think as an industry -- and we just need to have solutions to some of those issues before we see broad market adoption of these new technologies.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">You also commented that you see a very strong opportunity for electrolyzers in the near term. Can you talk about longer term? Is that where Cummins still sees the greater revenue opportunity or do you think it will be fuel cells over time once adoption picks up?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">James Hopkins</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">We certainly see very good opportunities in both of those markets. As you mentioned, I think there is probably additional visibility to the electrolyzers in the short run. We’re in the process of building out electrolyzer installations. Today, we've announced several other project wins in that space. And there has been a lot of industry activity from the power side on moving forward with some of those green grid balancing. </p>
<p class="p p7">So I'd say kind of just more visibility on some of the electrolyzers, a little bit more certainty on projects coming forward. The opportunity in the fuel cells remains significant. But I think what you'll see is that will just take a little bit more time to come to fruition as some of the constraining factors, the infrastructure, the cost, the durability are sorted out by the industry. </p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And can you just remind us what are your current hydrogen products sales today? And given some of the additional visibility you have on the electrolyzers side, how do you see that ramping over the next one to three years?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">James Hopkins</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yeah. So the revenues of our hydrogen portfolio are within our new power business unit. So that's where those revenues would reside. So we don't have a guidance number right now for any of our business units this year. But we do expect to see some meaningful growth in that over the next few years as we see increased adoption. But we have to wait a little bit longer for specific targets on that.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Just coming to the end of our session, we have a couple of questions from the audience. Can you just talk about the leadership change in the new power segment and talk about -- has it changed the strategy of the segment at all?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">James Hopkins</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yeah. We’re excited for the change there. So, for the first couple of years of that new power business unit's life, we had Thad Ewald who also ran corporate strategy, running that business. And during that time period, there was a lot of activity around acquisitions whether it was the three battery-related companies or Hydrogenics that we purchased, and a lot of work on positioning, determining from a strategic perspective where we wanted to participate. I think it has gone exceptionally well. We feel very well-positioned from a strategic perspective. </p>
<p class="p p7">Earlier this year, we kind of moved focus in some regards to starting to produce and commercialized. And so as we make that transition, we made a change in leadership. Deb still runs our Strategy Group growth office, and then we've moved Amy Davis over who used to run our filtration business. And prior roles ran one of our distribution entities in North America, also has a history in our on-highway business to lead that New Power segment. And so, the focus they're shifting to manufacturing and commercialization of technology, and we think that we have a great team currently in that new power business to move us forward on that journey.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And then just one more question from the audience on your mining segment. Do you think that, is it safe to assume that will coal will be down and all other minerals will be up for the year?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">James Hopkins</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">I think given the first half of the year performance, it would be very hard for coal to be anything other than down. I think on the other minerals, still probably a little too early. Still have six months of results there. But that could potentially go either way depending on demand in the second half of the year. </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Courtney Yakavonis</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay, great. Well, James, thank you so much for joining us today and thank you to everyone on the line. Really appreciate your time and good luck with the rest of your meetings today.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>James Hopkins</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Great. Thanks so much.</p></div>
