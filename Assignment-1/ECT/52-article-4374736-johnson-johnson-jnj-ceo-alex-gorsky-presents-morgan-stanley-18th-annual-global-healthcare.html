<p class="p p1">David Lewis - Morgan Stanley</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>David Lewis</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">I want to welcome to the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Conference 2020. Thanks for joining us here for the first two days. And we are excited obviously about the back half of the week. It is my pleasure to have this morning, continuing our coverage this morning, the CEO and Chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Alex Gorsky. It’s always a pleasure to have Alex be with you and I appreciate taking time to be this year this morning.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Alex Gorsky</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Sure. Well, David, it’s good to be with you today, albeit remotely, but thanks a lot for having us and I look forward to the conversation.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - David Lewis</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. I appreciate it. So, I want to start strategically and this is one of my, an oldie, but a goodie, Alex, but I feel like I want to ask it again. It’s a funny time, right. You would have all these disparate businesses. The consumer business is benefiting from your pantry stocking the pharmaceutical business is running as this is the hallmark of vaccine development trying to get us back to work and the device business obviously being acutely affected and the hospital system has been impacted, so three disparate businesses being impacted all different ways. Does it make you feel now that the benefit of having all these businesses together? Are you more emboldened? That’s the right decision for Johnson &amp; Johnson or does it make you think maybe this is the time in the post-COVID world to think about a Johnson &amp; Johnson that’s more effective in its parts versus the whole?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Well, again, David, thank you very much for having us on and look, I think more than ever, what this demonstrates is that J&amp;J was really built for times like this. And maybe before I get into a discussion around the portfolio, which I do think is important though, I just want to start off by thanking all of our colleagues at J&amp;J, who frankly have just been doing awesome work over the last 6 or 7 months. I mean to think back in February, March, when we first got word about this. What we were doing and they have been able to keep serving patients and consumers and we have been able to keep our employees safe, when you think about not only the impact on our core business, but the way that we have been able to accelerate development of a vaccine that could truly have an impact on the world at this particular time, let alone the extraordinary work that’s been going on in communities, particularly during times of a lot of racial and social unrest, certainly here in the United States and at the same time staying focused on delivering strong competitive results to the business and for our shareholders, I couldn’t be more proud. And what’s really important is that while we have about 150,000 employees, many of them working remotely doing the Zoom just like we are right now, about 50,000 of those have been going to work everyday. And they have been in our manufacturing facilities, they have been in our laboratories, making sure that the products and services that you know are so important for healthcare systems and patients can still get access and that we are not seeing a slowdown in our clinical trials or gaps in either the patient care or in the datasets that are being developed. So, I think it’s really important to acknowledge them and thank them upfront.</p>
<p class="p p1">And secondly, I think it’s also a real testament to our model during these kind of times that frankly our business is doing as well as its doing. If you think about our pharmaceutical performance, for example, you mentioned first half of the year seeing about 7% growth and you look at all of our different categories, whether it’s oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, we are seeing really good solid performance in many cases actual share gains, the way the teams have rallied to ensure that patients could continue to get access that we continued compliance that we were still reaching out to physicians, getting patients the kind of access programs they needed. Our consumer group like you can said, you can imagine the volatility and some of the demand when you see Tylenol up 78% in North America due to some of the pantry stuffing, the offset in other areas. Nonetheless, we have been able to ensure consistent and continuous supply throughout that and by the way, also adjusting our supply chain so that we could add a hand sanitizer ready. And in our medical device business, there too when you see surgeries around the world extensively shutdown for several months, but what’s really impressive and I know we can talk about this more, David, is when you look at the resiliency of the hospital systems, clearly here in the United States, but around the world and coming back, getting online, making sure that elective procedures are being performed and we have been partnering, collaborating with them on that to make sure that they have got the tools, the devices and the other services that are required. So really – and then by the way, while we were doing all that, we have also been working on a vaccine and doing what would normally take 5 to 7 years being able to doing about 5 to 7 months to ensure that we have a safe, effective vaccine that’s accessible to people around the world. So, we really think that the only way that we could do that is because of frankly the diversity, the scale, the reach and the capabilities in total of Johnson &amp; Johnson and we think that’s not only what has delivered long-term sustainable, historical returns and frankly, innovations historically, but that’s what we will also ensure that we continue to do that in the future.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay. So it’s an impassioned defense of the existing J&amp;J structure and you still seem very committed and this is the right structure for Johnson &amp; Johnson?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">But David, I would add one other element to that and that is that I think as you have seen, certainly over the past 9 plus years now, we put a very high standard on place on where we choose to compete and where we choose not to compete. And I think if you look at our track record of divestitures that making sure that look, if we are not number one or number two in a market, if we don’t see a strong business, if we don’t see a strong path of innovation going forward, if it’s not complimentary to one of our other businesses, we will exit that business and we will put that capital to use in other areas where we think we can make a better difference for patients and consumers and actually generate better returns. So, it’s very much performance based. Each one of our sectors is benchmarked against their respective area. We also look for convergent opportunities, which we see in areas, for example, like in lung cancer, more and more on oncology, potentially urology and other areas in the future. So, it’s not just a strategy that we are attached to historically, but it’s one that we truly think best positions us for the long-term and where healthcare is going in the future.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay. So, let’s dive into some of these segments, Alex and see kind of the progress has been made, you talked about the resiliency of the U.S. hospital system, J&amp;J was actually early. You set the mark on talking about medical device recovery. And to be honest when you first said it, I am not sure who really believed you. We have seen pretty robust even V-shaped type recovery. How has a medical device recovery fared in the acute care setting here since the second quarter? I mean, we have heard a lot of commentary about month-over-month improvement. Are you still confident in sort of steady cadence of month-over-month improvement and how are you feeling about getting back to normal here in the fourth quarter?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, look, here too major kudos go out to the U.S. hospital system. I mean, throughout this pandemic, David, I was reaching out talking with a lot of the CEOs from around the country and the efforts, the commitment that the doctors, the nurses, all the support staff put in to managing this pandemic, particularly the eye of the hurricane you might say, in areas like New York, New Jersey, other hotspots that came up later on and you see the tremendous decrease that we have seen in mortality rate, it’s quite remarkable. And look, one patient dying is too many. But I think it’s really important to acknowledge the steps that they took. And on top of that, they have remained very committed to getting their hospitals backup in these other areas, because we know that everyday that a procedure is delayed for a cancer patient, frankly for an orthopedic patient that has long-term consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality and so we have seen them put the right protocols in place, testing procedures, getting the right PPE, sectioning off different departments, moving some patients to an ambulatory setting where possible. And as a result, I think throughout the United States and really throughout the world right now, we are seeing return rates to about 90% to 95% of pre-COVID which look I am proud of the projections that our team made, if you remember back, when we did first quarter results. You are right, there was probably some skepticism, but our team did their homework. We tried to take a very fact-based approach. And what we have seen frankly our results quite consistent in fact a little bit better.</p>
<p class="p p2">Now, if we look past, if you remember our second quarter, our business was down about 33%, but we saw sequential improvement in April, May and June, with June being down only about 20%. Since then, we have seen positive momentum. And look it won’t be linear. We still have to navigate our way through. We have seen these surges in certain places. We have to keep our eye out for as people perhaps do go back to schools to the work environment, how that impacts the fourth quarter. We don’t believe that it will be have the same impact that we saw back in the second quarter. We think hospitals are much better prepared. They have got better medicines, better protocols, but it’s something that we are going to have to watch, but look we are optimistic going forward and we remain very committed to make sure we are doing everything we can to supply them and support them as they work their way through the backlog. And I think look, I think the other thing we need to keep our eye on are what about that new patient inflow? And as I talk to physicians making sure that primary care visits that the diagnostic procedures necessary to identify those patients and get them prepared for surgery that those things keep on flowing as well.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. Are you confident that this patient willingness dynamic gallops that you referenced? I mean are you confident as we get into ‘21 the healthcare system is functioning relatively normally? Are you concerned somewhat about these patient willingness dynamics?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Look, I think I understand that patients could be concerned. And then somebody has had family members who have actually been in the hospital seeking care during this timeframe and with somebody who has a lot of knowledge, I can understand that. But look I think, again what hospitals have demonstrated for the most part, as I have talked to CEOs is we haven’t seen significant increases in infection rates. We have seen really good protocols put into place. We have seen patient satisfaction scores remain high. And so – and I think as time goes on, as hospitals and the healthcare system continues to deliver care in that manner that you will see increasing confidence. Now, again, we can’t predict will there be other surgeries? We are hopeful for right now actually about the flu season, if we look to places like Australia, New Zealand, so far the flu season in those areas, it’s actually been dramatically low, because people are taking a lot of protective measures masking, washing their hands, social distancing, that should help the flu season. But look, we all need to remain very vigilant and cautious frankly until we have a vaccine on board and we stamp this virus off.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. Look another essentially during a time of significant tumult, you have not been afraid to deploy capital, right. So recently, your move to acquire Momenta, [indiscernible] said why Momenta, people forget immunology is your biggest business within broader pharmaceuticals, why is Momenta the right ask, what’s the enthusiasm around Momenta?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, David, you are right, I think the first step – the first question we had to answer is how do we continue to serve patients and consumers? Second, how do we take care of our employees? Third is how do we keep our core businesses going in a healthy way? At the same time, we wanted to do that and not sacrifice the long-term opportunities that we saw out in the field and so look, Momenta I think is representative of a classic J&amp;J long-term success deal. And if you think about our portfolio whether it be in immunology, with our acquisition of Synacor and Remicade many years ago, you think about how we built our oncology franchise. It’s where we identify a very unique mechanism, in this case, it’s auto antibodies, where we have got a lot of clinical development expertise, a lot of regulatory expertise, a lot of commercial reimbursement expertise, we apply those to this very early promising data that we have, nipocalimab right now. If you look at it, it’s somewhat de-risked and that it’s not just in one indication, but its spread across multiple indications. We are very excited. For example, in areas such as myasthenia gravis, we know it works not only in neuro, but obviously in immunology as well. If you look in other areas like AIHD or HDFN, excuse me, there is really good opportunities. So, this is a classic Johnson &amp; Johnson kind of opportunity. And we think collaborating with Momenta in this way gives us an opportunity to build, you might say a sixth or seventh leg to our pharmaceutical stool. And it’s on a timeline that we also think is very attractive to us in the interim. And so look, we are very hopeful and I couldn’t be more proud of the work that Jennifer Mathi and the rest of the team did to make that possible.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. How are you feeling about this in the construct of pharmaceutical acceleration? There are several reasons why we upgraded the stock late last year. One was a more balanced J&amp;J. One was pharmaceutical acceleration, the other one is our view on legal liability, which will I am sure we will touch on here for a few minutes at least, but pharmaceutical acceleration is part of the key tenet of that and you are definitely seeing in the first half of the year. How do you feel about sort of the pharmaceutical acceleration? And how does sort of Momenta make you feel about you have some generic substitution events in 2023, so pharmaceutical acceleration this year and with Momenta and other pipeline programs, the ability to continue to grow above market here these next few years?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Look, we are very confident in our ability to continue to grow our pharmaceutical business. I think it’s very well positioned in its core business. Look, if you look at the strength, the depth, the breadth of our current oncology portfolio, whether it’s Darzalex, whether it’s ibrutinib, the great uptake that we are seeing in those areas, if you take a look at immunology, the uptake that we are seeing with Stelara, [indiscernible] if you all of those categories were seeing solid growth. We are seeing earlier penetration. We are seeing access to additional patient populations. And as a result, we saw 7% growth through the first half of this year, which again given all of the other dynamics is quite remarkable. Now, if we look at the back half of the year, while we are continuing to see an increase in physician visits and positive signs regarding new patients being identified in continuation of therapies, we will have to watch that closely. We also know that the second half of last year we saw particularly strong growth in our pharmaceutical business, so comparatives will be a bit different, but fundamentally, we are going to – our goal is to continue to grow at and above the market growth rate. And we think through number one, the de-risked opportunities that we have by expanded indications as you know, overall, we have more than 50 over the next 4 years, 10 of which we think about, have about a $0.5 billion of opportunity, our core business growth opportunities, the 10 new compounds that we expect to either file or launch between now and 2024 with a $1 billion opportunity. You put the Momenta deal on top of that. We think it positions us very well. And last but not least, David, what I would say is just look at our history of performance. I mean, time and time again, people could have potentially been skeptical about our ability to launch into oncology in a major way 9 years ago. They were skeptical about our ability to withstand the REMICADE launch of biosimilars in that area, ZYTIGA. And you look and our team has continued to innovate, they have continued to execute, they have continued to deliver throughout that period.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. And every time a bigger pharmaceuticals enter election cycle, I feel like I would be remiss just to bring it up very quickly. Is there anything about the ongoing political climate, I feel that there has been an assault against pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical innovation last several years, but part of me says, there is really nothing this election could bring that we haven’t already seen or heard or answered. Is that sort of how you see are there any concerns investors should have heading into this new election cycle about pharmaceutical innovation, pricing, any upcoming regulations?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Well look, we all know that we are heading into a very political season. And I think what we try to communicate through all this is really just the important role the biopharmaceutical industry plays in overall healthcare. And so in spite of much of the noise and sensationalism that we are likely to hear over the next 48, 49 days and even beyond making sure that look – let’s look at the current situation. It is remarkable that we have more than 200 approaches on a vaccine overall, about 10 of which literally are in Phase 1, somewhere between Phase 1 and Phase 3 as we speak and that’s been done over the last 5 or 7 months. And the only way that we are going to be successful and truly eradicating this virus and when I say eradicate I use that loosely, because I think we are going to be dealing with it through years, but we will certainly bring it under much better control with a vaccine and with therapeutics is because the biopharmaceutical industry has been investing literally billions of dollars for the last several decades that’s enabled this kind of acceleration. And so, whether you look at the portion of overall healthcare spending at about 14% that’s invested in pharmaceuticals, if you look at the percentage – the impact that that’s had on life expectancy, likely 50% to 75% of the increase in life expectancy, when you look at the fact that usually after 5 to 7 years, many of these compounds are available literally for pennies. Once they become generic or ones that, others are launched, it shows that the system does work. Now, there are clearly areas where improvements can be made and areas such as co-payments, particularly in our system for Medicare patients, we need to get those reduced, especially given the tremendous improvement that we are seeing in patients’ lives attributed to the pharmaceutical products, the fact that 20 5% of the average co-pay for a pharmaceutical product is coming out of the patient’s pocket versus only less than 5% for hospital care, that’s something that should be addressed. Are there ways of doing contracting in different ways that are more outcomes based? Absolutely. We were trying to work with payers and providers to do that, but what we don’t want to do is we don’t want to sacrifice the innovative nature of this industry and that’s required and that’s producing all of the kind of breakthroughs that we are talking about. We have tried to take a very bipartisan approach on both sides of the aisle to educate. That being said, look, we know this is a very political season and we need to do an even better job of communicating that, not only to legislators and to the government, but frankly, to consumers as well.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay, very helpful Alex. And couple of topics I want to hit before we close out our time. One is just on litigation, I know it was a tough topic to talk about publicly there is probably limited things you can disclose, but look there are two components of this. It’s the opioid piece and the talc piece. We have seen a fair amount of movement in opioids, even more movement here in a post-COVID world. How are you feeling about some of the dollar figures that have been thrown out there? We saw initial settlements. We have seen new settlements around that $5 billion. Are you feeling better about the ability to sort of range bound the risk for investors around opioid? And what about the timing to resolution getting the money back to the communities to getting better sense of timing, is this something that can be resolved in the next 6 months?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure, David. Well, first of all, thanks for the question. And I think the perspective you have provided is spot on. And that we always put safety, quality compliance first and foremost in everything that we do and we certainly have them both these situations. We always try to follow the science, the data when making these kind of decisions, particularly when we choose to defend our product. And we also I think have a history and a track record of trying to resolve these things in a way that’s best for all of our stakeholders over time, assuming we can find a reasonable way to do that. That’s the approach that we are taking in both these situations. We have been very transparent and public certainly about our approaches and we expect to continue that. I don’t think it would be right to contribute or for me to comment much beyond that at this point, but look, we remain committed to getting these things resolved in the best way for all of our stakeholders.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. Do you feel in opioids, you seem to be taking a different tack you obviously have in talc-based litigation? I feel like in talc, with sciences on your side, how are you balancing out this notion of the sciences on your side, it makes sense to protect the company, protect shareholders, because the science is on your side, but at the same time knowing it’s a bit of an overhang of the business and you want to resolve in the interest of shareholders, those are two masters that are hard to serve and how are you thinking about that?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. Well, look, I think you have to take each situation based upon its unique characteristics. Regarding opioids, look, we understand the impact that it’s had on our country and we are trying to be a very responsible partner in the way that we are responding. And we also try to be very responsible in the way that we address all of our other litigation issues as well. So look, as I said, I think our track record, our history demonstrates that we are very thoughtful, very deliberate in trying to bring these things to an appropriate closure, so that we can move ahead in the right way, but we can also serve all of our other stakeholders in the right way and that’s what we will do in this case as well.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay, very helpful. If you just transition here to vaccines a little bit, are you still comfortable with the timelines that you set forth to investors around the vaccines towards the latter part of this year?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. The short answer is yes, we remain committed to the earlier comments that we made. And look here too, I couldn’t be more proud of our team, who quickly took some of the sequencing information back in January, quickly applied it to our platform or add that platform, ran it through the early preclinical trials and look, David, I think it’s really important here is that this is a proven platform that’s been used in I believe close to 90,000 patients, it’s been used in the DRC and for things like Ebola, HIV. So, it’s got a very good characterization of its safety profile certainly and our preclinical models show very promising data regarding its efficacy as well. As you know, we are conducting a Phase 1 trial as we speak of over 1,000 patients. We are in the process of analyzing a lot of that data literally real-time. We will be working very closely with the regulators taking the outcomes of that data, building that into all of our protocols for Phase 3 trial that we hope to start in the coming weeks. And clearly, we will be in much better position then to really be able to characterize and understand the safety, the efficacy, the delivery of the vaccine at that point in time. And simultaneously, we are ramping up our ability to supply and there too our current thinking based upon the great partnerships that we now have with multiple different partners in the U.S. as well as Europe, in India, they will also be in a position to supply substantial volumes up to by the end of 2021 up to 1 billion doses. But we have to – there is still information we need to find out for example around the dosing that has a direct impact on the specific amount of supply that will be available, but all of our – so far our current beliefs are very consistent with our earlier projections and understanding. And as we get more information and more data, we will certainly make that available.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. So Paul has sounded very confident in this vaccine platform, it sounds your confidence is coming from some of the existing data. It’s also coming from the fact this platform has been tried and tested and your confidence is platform from February to now has stayed relatively firm, it sounds like?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Correct.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay, very helpful. And then just financially, Alex, [indiscernible] I don’t know that for J&amp;J, the financials of the vaccine are frankly the most important thing, how should we think about this from a financial perspective for J&amp;J, I have already talked about this being sort of not for profit? Is this a multi-hundred million dollar opportunity for J&amp;J? Is it a $1 billion opportunity for J&amp;J?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Well, look, as we said, we are going to do this on a not-for-profit basis. We think it was critical for a company like J&amp;J to do so given the extent of its impact frankly around the world. We are going to do that for the pandemic period, because we believe that our vaccine platform is going to be very important in the future as well. And by the way, as I mentioned earlier, we don’t believe our vaccine or any of the current vaccines will necessarily be the lone silver bullets – single bullet that will eradicate COVID-19, we are likely going to be dealing with this for some time on an ongoing basis that may require boost. We will have to see how the virus may or may not mutate going forward. And so those are all things that are TBD, but we also recognize that this is going to launch us in a very significant direction of having a vaccine platform, because prior obviously, it was relatively limited to some of the global public health areas like Ebola and HIV work. Now, when we think about not only what we are doing with COVID, but when we think about potential with RSV that this set – this could set up again another leg on our pharmaceutical portfolio going forward and result in a significant opportunity for us.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">We have 2 minutes left. Alex, I guess, you are the CEO of the largest healthcare corporation in the world. You see a lot of things you talk to a lot of people. This is our first global pandemic in decades, maybe arguably since polio. What do you see as key themes or key changes either from a corporate perspective or healthcare perspective that emerged in a post-COVID world?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Well, I think there are several David and look, we are learning about this everyday. More people have probably gotten this, their projections wrong rather than right. In this case though what I would say…</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Alex Gorsky</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">That’s all of us. In this case though, what I would say is clearly an understanding the importance of healthcare in global public health. I mean, in many ways, David, we don’t have, what we found out through this is we don’t have national security, we don’t have economic security. We don’t have societal security, if we don’t have strong global public healthcare systems in place and I think unfortunately in the past, they have tended to be one of the lower priorities. And I think coming out of this healthcare systems, not only here in the United States, but around the world, are going to have to move strictly from effectiveness and efficiency to resiliency and redundancy in certain cases. And so I think that represents an opportunity to help us do a much better job at the next pandemic, which could still happen even during our lifetime. So, I think that’s one fact. I think secondly, I think one of the things that we have certainly seen across healthcare is the importance of technology and data. And one of the major differences between the Spanish flu and this is frankly our ability to gather and understand data what was happening real time. And as a result, we could then triangulate, we could identify hotspots, we could better characterize the disease, the spread, the risk that’s involved, we could better and faster accelerate the development of vaccines, all that’s enabled by data and technology, I think that’s going to be ubiquitous in the uptake going forward in almost every sector of healthcare. And third but not last but not least, I would say just about the way that we work. And by the way, that’s healthcare systems. That’s you. That’s me. I think all of us know that in our case, we would say, working together in a proximate way is important for culture. It’s important for innovation, collaboration, but we won’t go back to completely the way that we work before. I think we are all going to be perhaps a bit more effective, a bit more efficient. We are going to think more about when do we do this kind of an engagement versus a person to person. And I think hopefully that will actually improve our output and our ability to work together and collaborate going forward.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">David Lewis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">This is great thoughts, Alex. I know you are a very busy individual and I very much appreciate taking time this year for me in the conference. Thank you for being with us today and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day and everyone else, thanks for listening.</p></div>
