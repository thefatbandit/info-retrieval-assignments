<p class="p p1">Good morning to all of you. A very warm welcome to the 2020 Pan African Year End Results Presentation. Hopefully we will meet again soon in person. In the interim, thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedules to join us virtually today. Pan African strategy is to position ourselves as a sustainable, safe, high margin, and long life gold producer. The last financial year has again seen us taking significant steps towards the delivering into this strategy.</p>
<p class="p p1">We are very proud of our recently launched new corporate identity. Please join us for a couple of minutes as we view a clip that should give you even more of a sense of the DNA of Pan African Resources.</p>
<p class="p p1">[Video Presentation]</p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you and welcome again. Rest assured that we will keep the presentation fairly brief, even though we again have a number of positive developments to highlight. There will be an opportunity for questions after our presentation. Please refer to our SENS, RNS announcements, and to the supplementary information available on the Pan African website, should you require further detail not dealt with in today's presentation.</p>
<p class="p p1">As per usual, our disclaimer and detail on forward-looking statements can be found on Page 2 and 3. On Slide 4, an overview of the presentation. We will spend time on the impact of – and our response to COVID-19, and follow up with some of the highlights and features of the year past, which was a year of delivery for Pan African. I believe it is a key that we provide shareholders with a sense of how well positioned we are for the year ahead from an operational perspective. This means spending some time on our key mining assets and also our ESG initiatives.</p>
<p class="p p1">Deon will analyze our financials, including detail on the group de-gearing and the very large increase in the proposed dividend payout. We will conclude with an update on Egoli and our outlook for the business for the year ahead. So, let's get right into it.</p>
<p class="p p1">Slide number 6. Firstly, our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19 and those who have suffered with the illness. I am incredibly proud of the manner in which the people of Pan African responded to the massive challenges presented by the pandemic and by the lockdown situation. We started planning well in advance of any lockdown putting protocols in place, educating our staff on prevention, and identifying and stocking up on critical consumables and space.</p>
<p class="p p1">Within 24 hours of receiving word of the hard lockdown in South Africa we had our detailed plans mapped out, and have communicated those plans to all stakeholders. We managed to look after our people and also protect our assets. We operated our tailings operations with just 20% of the normal staff complement, and we ensure that our underground mines were ready to hit the ground running so to speak, once we received the okay from government.</p>
<p class="p p1">The accelerated rated ramp up post lockdown is testament to the quality of management and commitment of our people. And I wish to again thank each and every Pan African employee for your dedication and very hard work during this difficult time. In terms of the numbers, it is encouraging to see our number of cases going down. As of yesterday, we only had one employee still hospitalized with a recovery rate of more than 90% for our group.</p>
<p class="p p1">On Slide number 7, not only did we manage to operate successfully during the height of the pandemic, we also managed to assist others. And we will continue to do so. We assisted employees and also vulnerable community members, distributing thousands of food and essential hampers to the most needy. Our policies and procedures were audited by external parties, and generally the results were favorable, and we adjusted policies and practices where required.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">In terms of COVID-19, we do not know what the future holds, but we are as prepared as we can be. If we then turn the page, in terms of financial year 2020, despite corona, the year was a year of delivery for Pan African. That is demonstrated in our safety, financial, and also our operational achievements.</p>
<p class="p p2">Let’s have a closer look at a summary of our performance on Slide 9. In terms of safety, we managed to maintain our industry leading lost time and reportable injury frequency rate performance. For the first time in the operations history, Barberton mines achieved 3 million fatality fee shifts, and Fairview Operation 2 million. Elikhulu went for 11 months without recording one single lost time injury, which is exceptional.</p>
<p class="p p2">Against the backdrop of this achievement, we are saddened to report a fatal injury related to a fall of ground accident at our Fairview mine in July 2020 post year-end. We again express our condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of Mr. Mavimbela and also Mr. Williamson, who was injured in the accident. In terms of safety, we will continue our unrelenting push to do better.</p>
<p class="p p2">Also on Slide 9, Deon will spend more time on our financial performance, but a couple of comments from my side. We changed our reporting currency to U.S. dollars in 2019. If we were still reporting in South African Rand it would have been a record profit year 2020. We estimated COVID cost us more than 10,000 ounces in lost production. Despite the setback, we managed to [hov senior debt] and significantly reduced our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio during the year.</p>
<p class="p p2">We are also proposing a record Rand dividend to shareholders for approval at the upcoming AGM. This recommended dividend demonstrates our confidence in the positioning of the business in the next year. At current gold prices, assuming we meet production guidance, we should be pretty much date free at the end of a FY 2021.</p>
<p class="p p2">Slide 10m if we move on to operational performance. We will discuss detail per operation in the next slides. However, the following is worth noting. We managed to increase production in the year passed by some 4%, despite COVID. Even more encouraging is that we are increasing our production guidance for the year ahead to approximately 190,000 ounces, an increase of some 6% broadly comprised as follows.</p>
<p class="p p2">100,000 ounces from the Barberton complex, 60,000 ounces from Elikhulu, and 30,000 ounces from our 8 Shaft pillar operation, which is now steady state. This increase in production guidance again demonstrates how quickly we managed to ramp up post the hard lockdown. </p>
<p class="p p2">We also now source 50% of our gold from surface operations and production. Certainly are all-in sustaining costs for the year that's passed was badly impacted by huge losses and also by the impact of COVID related production losses. But I think on an absolute cost basis, our costs are very well controlled. Barberton’s total cost base increases with less than 10% per annum. As we mine more gold in the next year, the unit cost for all of our operations should also decrease.</p>
<p class="p p2">On Slide number 11, it includes a simplified, but easy to understand schematic of our flagship tailings retreatment operation Elikhulu and also its 12 years life of mine plan. During the financial year 2020, Elikhulu [treated] 13 million tons of tailings at head grade of 0.3 grams per ton to recover almost 60,000 ounces of gold. We produce these answers at an all-in sustaining cost of just over $600 per ounce, which I believe is exceptional.</p>
<p class="p p2">Compartment one of the Kinross Tailings facility is now undergoing floor cleanup to establish the area for the construction of enlarged Kinross Tailings facility during the next year. So, we are finishing up on Kinross in the next two years, and then we are moving to Leslie/Bracken with a final four to five years of Elikhulu’s life on the Winkelhaak Tailings Facility.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">The operation ticks all of the boxes in terms of low cost, safe, long life with the added benefit, but we are reducing our environmental footprint as we go along. The 10 MVA solar plant that we will construct on site in the next year at a cost of approximately 150 million rand will take care of most of Elikhulu’s day time power requirements and also further add to operations sustainability into the future.</p>
<p class="p p3">In the year past, we spent very limited capital on Elikhulu. In the next two years, we are enlarging the tailings footprint and also preparing to move to the Leslie/Bracken tailings facility. The capital required for these initiatives is approximately 300 million rand split over the two years. Once this move is complete, the capital will again drop to a very limited number for Elikhulu. Also worth noting as a final point on Elikhulu that the operation generated almost a billion rand of EBITDA in the last year at a much lower gold price than prevailing spot.</p>
<p class="p p3">On Slide 12, in terms of our BTRP at Barberton, or our other tailings business, we produced just over 20,000 ounces for the financial year in-line with guidance and expectations. The BTRP’s costs were higher in the current year as a result of lower recoveries from the areas where we are currently mining being Harper North, again in-line with what we expected and also the cost of buying material.</p>
<p class="p p3">Now BTRP’s life is currently six years and we should be able to maintain the cost at these levels in the next years. We are also finalizing studies and plans for alternative feedstocks, including from our Royal Sheba project, in order to keep BTRP going for many more years.</p>
<p class="p p3">On Slide 13, which is a schematic of our Fairview and also our Sheba underground operations of Barberton, we always refer to the Barberton underground as a universe of opportunities and it continues to prove true. Fairview has a life of mine of 20 years only on current reserves, but I suspect the operation will outlive us all. In the last years, the mining and development layout at our high grade MRC ore body has been optimized to enhance mining flexibility and decrease the waste development required.</p>
<p class="p p3">Currently, we have three active high grade platforms and production cycle with a fourth platform being accessed in a FY 2021. Having four high growth platforms to cycle at Fairview mine has not been the case for many years. We should be in a position to commence with the [indiscernible] of the Fairview sub-vertical shaft in the next 12 months to 24 months. And a Fairview mine is very well positioned for the year ahead.</p>
<p class="p p3">If we then move on to Slide 14, an achievement that we are particularly proud of is the much publicized discovery of Consort’s PC Shaft 42 level. We promised shareholders that we would turn Consort around and now we have. The group successfully executed into this turnaround strategy for the new Consort operation by developing and establishing the extremely high grade mining panel on 42 level PC shaft. This specific target block is only the first of seven identified target areas that are currently being evaluated.</p>
<p class="p p3">You will note from the production profile, from Consort, that production has increased maturity in the last month with unit costs of production decreasing. We still aim to reduce Consort’s all-in sustaining costs to approximately $1,200 per ounce by year-end. And I wish to specifically give credit to our mining and MRM teams for this 42 level initiatives. Suffice to say, that has given Consult a new lease on life.</p>
<p class="p p3">On Slide 15, the Evander 8 Shaft pillar, so steady state production the pillar was achieved during May 2020 with nine crews’ now actively mining panels within the pillar. This pillar mining is much less complex than the historic mining at Evander 8 Shaft because we have much shorter training distances. We have improved ventilation and environmental conditions. There are minimal geological disturbances in the pillar area.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">We have pre-developed mining blocks resulting in high confidence in grade and orebody continuity, and the 8 Shaft pillars also relatively shallow when compared to other South African pillar operations. So to conclude on 8 Shaft, we have – look, the capital we have invested in its development should pay itself back in the first year of steady state production.</p>
<p class="p p4">On Slide number 16, in summary, in our assets, we have a unique value proposition of surface re-mining and underground operations. Our assets are long life, highly cash generative, and have further optimization and growth potential.</p>
<p class="p p4">On Slide number 17, the costs of our low cost operations are pretty compelling. And these comprise the largest part of our portfolio by far. I also think that the initiatives highlighted in the previous slides should give comfort on how we plan on reducing the cost of production at our higher cost operations. So, what does all of this translate to in terms of Slide number 18, a targeted all-in sustaining cost of $1,000 per ounce for FY 2021 at an assumed dollar rand exchange rate of 16.5. This excludes aging profits or losses. This cost profile is very much in line with the global average.</p>
<p class="p p4">On Slide 19, very briefly, a CapEx profile for our group. We are reinvesting quite a bit into our assets. However, you can expect the overall CapEx for the current operations to reduce in the years ahead. If we then move on to Slide 21, ESG, or environmental, social and governance, this is really part of our DNA and it's part of what we do. In the past, we have maybe not articulated this focus and our achievements sufficiently. This has to change and we have to do even more.</p>
<p class="p p4">Some of the initiatives I have to mention are the following: Our board has approved a major agriculture project in Barberton utilizing very fertile, but currently fellow mine land. This initiative has the potential of creating more than 400 permanent jobs. I've mentioned the solar project and planted vendor which is only Phase 1. We will look to expand this plant to a possible 25 MVA for Egoli and we are also conducting a feasibility into a similar plant at Barberton.</p>
<p class="p p4">Our closure costs are fully funded. And during the year, we increased our ongoing rehabilitation initiatives, including the final closure of Evander 5 and 9 Shafts. We were subject to a number of independent audits and reviews, including on our tailings facilities and our carbon emissions. And I have to say, I'm particularly proud of the work that we are doing with regards to schools and clinics in the Barberton area.</p>
<p class="p p4">Let me pause here and hand over to Deon to take us through the financial results and emphasize some key matters.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Deon Louw</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Thank you, Cobus. Slide 23 summarizes the group's results for the 2020 financial year. Evident is an increase in turnover by 26%, resulting from a combination of a 1% increase in gold sold, and a substantial increase in the dollar gold price by 24% and 37% in rent terms, falling to 23% year-on-year depreciation in the rent dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p class="p p4">Although earnings increased year-on-year by 17%, the 2019 comparative financial results included in a payment reversal of 18 million, which if eliminated, shows that earnings actually increased by 93% as is reflected in headline earnings, which under these circumstances is a more appropriate indicator of the relative performance. These payment reversals relate to the commencement of Evander’s 8 Shaft pillar project, following the payment of the [8 Shaft complex] in the 2018 financial year.</p>
<p class="p p4">Adjusted EBITDA, which also excluding payment reversals increased by 52% to $87 million enabling the reduction in net senior debt of 52% to $62 million relative to the $130 million owing at the end of the prior financial year, Both in dollar and rent terms, all-in sustaining cost was adversely impacted by the COVID related production losses and the inclusion of realized hedge losses, which I'll touch on later in a subsequent slide.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">Slide 24 illustrates in the top half, the group's existing senior debt obligations, which were the 2021 financial year comprises 75 million rand on the RCA facility, and 200 million rand on the Elikhulu facility, a total of 275 million rand were approximately $16 million, but relative to the $340 million with $20 million of principle debt that matured in the 2020 financial year. Subsequent to year-end, we further reduced senior debt by 216 million, or approximately $15 million.</p>
<p class="p p5">The bottom half of the slide shows anticipated rate at which the group delivers its existing senior debt at the prevailing rand gold prices and guided production. In anticipation of the possible losses and associated negative cash flows resulting from the COVID-related operational disruptions, we defer the repayment of the lost 5,000 ounces of the gold loan to the first quarter of the 2021 financial year.</p>
<p class="p p5">Fortunately, COVID-related disruptions were well managed, with limited negative cash flow consequences and we ended the financial year with $34 million in cash relative to the $5 million at the end of the prior financial year. The new Egoli facilities first drawdown is anticipated in November 2020, and [indiscernible] 400 million rand in the first 18 months of the project development, followed by 800 million in Phase 2, which will be drilled down in the last 18 months of the project's three year development period.</p>
<p class="p p5">The Egoli facilities redemption profile of 24 months is sculptured to the cash flows generated from the project and should not curtail the group's ability to continue paying dividends from the cash flows generated by the existing suite of operating mines.</p>
<p class="p p5">Slide 25 illustrates the improvement in the group's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio following the repositioning of the business model in the 2018 financial year. At a ratio below one-to-one, the group's financial strength has materially improved and despite the new Egoli debt, it just continues to be robust given the operational mix and sustainability of the mines going forward.</p>
<p class="p p5">Slide 26 lots of rand gold price in kilograms over the loss by five years, during which the gold price increased by 117% from 456,000 rand a kilogram in June 2015 to 991,000 grand of kilogram in June 2020. This has however not been without volatility as we see the rand gold price increasing to 650,000 rand a kilogram on more than one occasion, only to revert again to levels well below 500,000 rand a kilogram, eliminating most of our cash flow margin. And after the post-Brexit peak of 2016, we see it took more than three years for the rand gold price to attain the level of 650,000 rand a kilogram again in August 2019.</p>
<p class="p p5">The 2020 financial year was no exception to rand gold price volatility. Where in the first half we saw a modest 7% increase in the rand gold price to 683,000 rand a kilogram. The second half saw a stellar 45% increase to 991,000 rand a kilogram. The group's debt is random nominated and with evident volatility in the rand gold price and onerous debt redemptions of the 2020 financial year.</p>
<p class="p p5">Our risk was a reversion in the rand gold price to below 650,000 rand a kilogram for protracted period of time, leading to covenant breaches and possibly an inability to redeem the senior debt obligations during this period. As the gold price progressively increased during the first nine months of the financial year, we increased our hedge levels to approximately 50% of the guided production to ensure that adequate cash flow margin is locked in for both debt redemption and an increased dividend. One at the same time being cognizant that some upside would be sacrificed in the event of a substantial spike in the gold price in the short-term.</p>
<p class="p p5">We keep our hedges short dated, and based these decisions on risk management principles, rather than a specific view of the gold prices prospects, least of all the probability of a global pandemic and its likely impact on the rand gold price. With a substantial spike in the rand gold prices in the second half of the financial year, realized hedge losses of $12 million were incurred and unrealized hedge losses of 10 million, while the remaining 50,000 ounces hedged for the second half of the 2021 financial year.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">Unfortunately, the profit and loss impact of these losses was exacerbated by a COVID-related production loss of approximately 10,000 ounces with the value of approximately 300 million rand, which would have materially offset the P&amp;L impact of the hedge losses. The remaining hedges for the 2021 financial year comprises 26% of guided ounces, with a floor price of 708,000 rand of kilogram and a ceiling price of 926,000 grand a kilogram, approximately 12% below the prevailing spot price of [1,050,000 rand] a kilogram.</p>
<p class="p p6">Post December 2020 the group is unhedged, and with the 52% reduction in net senior debt in the post financial the anticipated rate of deleveraging in the current financial year, future hedge levels will be more in-line with policy guidelines. Slide 25 illustrates historical dividend yields and yield of the proposed 2020 financial year dividend based on the share price at 30 June [of 370] or approximately US $0.21 per share. </p>
<p class="p p6">The dividend proposed by the board of [330 million rand] were approximately $19 million is in excess of the group's dividend policy guideline that takes into account the robust cash generation in the 2020 financial year and the favorable prospects for the 2021 financial year.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Cobus Loots</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Thank you very much, Deon. I think it is now worthwhile spending a bit of time on Egoli as our board has now approved the development of this project, and we have finalized the project finance on a non-diluted basis with our banking consortium. So, if I can ask that we move to Slide 29. We don't build projects for the sake of ounces. We only undertake a project where we are convinced that it will generate the requisite economic returns for our shareholders over its life, it's fairly conservative gold price assumptions.</p>
<p class="p p6">Now we get a number of offers of funding for Egoli, including office for streaming, royalties, and minority equity positions. These offers demonstrated the confidence that third parties has in our project and also in the feasibility work that we undertook. So, on Slide number 30, are we crazy to start a new mining project in South Africa? I guess the point is that Egoli is not new. It is utilizing existing infrastructure to access a [virgin ore body].</p>
<p class="p p6">The fact that there have been 10 vertical shaft sunk on Evander’s ore bodies says something about the quality of the Kimberley Reef in the Evander Basin. We don't have to sink, we equip a new vertical shaft for Egoli. We have a functioning twin vertical shaft system to 1,600 meters. </p>
<p class="p p6">We don't have to construct a new processing plant. The Kinross plant is currently operational and has the capacity to [cheat more] than 50,000 tons of hard rock per month. And we don't have to develop an underground haulage. The current haulage extends all of the 1.6 kilometers to the start of the decline.</p>
<p class="p p6">You will have to look far and wide to find a brownfield’s project able to produce almost 80,000 ounces for an initial life of mine of nine years with definite potential to also extend this life, at an all-in sustaining cost well south of the thousand dollars for a peak funding requirement of $17 million.</p>
<p class="p p6">In terms of the next steps, we are currently busy with detailed [scheduling] for Egoli, preliminary refurbishment is about to start, we will start placing orders for long lead items before the end of the calendar year, and for the dewatering and equipping will start before the end of the 2021 financial year. We have done the work on planning and checking for cycle flows. Going forward, we’ll again be about project execution and I think that is the way Pan African really excels.</p>
<p class="p p6">We really look forward to updating the market on Egoli on a regular basis. If we then move on to Slide 33, and our track record, I do think that our track record of delivery in terms of projects speaks for itself. There's no reason why Egoli will be different.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">In terms of looking ahead on Slide number 36. So, what are the key focus areas in the year ahead. We’ll continue to produce safely and sustainably into the production guidance of 190,000 ounces. We will certainly continue our ESG initiatives and efforts. We will reduce the group all-in sustaining costs to sub $1,000 per ounce through focused asset optimization. And then we'll continue to degear the balance sheet and increase dividends to shareholders. </p>
<p class="p p7">Let me conclude and thank all of my colleagues at Pan African Resources for your dedication and hard work in the last year. I would also like to thank all of our other stakeholders for your contributions to our business. We look forward to mining for a future in the year ahead. Thank you very much. Deon and I will now be available to take questions.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Deon Louw</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Great, thank you. I think we'll start with questions from the conference call if we have any.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p7"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Tim Huff of Peel Hunt.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Tim Huff</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yeah. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Just two really. I guess the first on, I know, you said you're going – it’s on Egoli, you said you're going into the detailed scheduling as we're looking forward, but you're starting with the prelim refurb, it sounds like this quarter, I guess, dewatering gets underway in a couple of quarters, do you – I mean, do you have a preliminary sort of feel as to how long the whole dewatering gets before you get to the whole footwall development and further associated decline work?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Deon Louw</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thanks. So yes, we are in the process of finalizing [indiscernible] we obviously as we mentioned we have bank approval for the facility. So, hopefully we'll get those legal signed, and then the development can start in earnest. Because of the mining we're doing an 8 Shaft, I mean, we’re obviously constantly busy with number 7 and we spent a bit of money and will continue to spend money, as and when needed.</p>
<p class="p p7">So the first goal, at this point spend 20 months from when we start the major development. And again, you know, that's a schedule that we will optimize. But, you know, as we said, I mean, we'll continue to update the market and hopefully we can expedite the refurbishment and development also.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Tim Huff</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, that's great. And the second question was just at Elikhulu, you guys went over fairly well, the CapEx needed over the next couple of years as you transition Elikhulu to the next stage, just wondering on an operating cost basis, I know there are disruptions across the board this year, but we're less in last fiscal year, sorry. And there were, you know, less disruption at the surface operation, particularly on Elikhulu, but I was just wondering in terms of cost progress, do you think you'll be able to get that back down below 600 bucks an ounce in the coming fiscal year or does it look like it's going to be holding around here?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Deon Louw</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yeah. So, we are obviously sort of [naturally] focused on reducing costs the way we can. Most of the costs at Elikhulu are variable. I think it was a very good cost performance. Clearly now, to the extent we can reduce costs will do so, but, you know, there's not an awful lot of scope decrease just squeezed down cost too much further Elikhulu.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Tim Huff</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, that's what I thought. So, it was a pretty similar outlook to be here up here where you are just looking for more steady state costs than anything else at both of [those apps]?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Deon Louw</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Tim Huff</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, that's great. Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Deon Louw</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thanks Tim.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">We have no further questions on the conference call.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Cobus Loots</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, great. So, I think we'll then take online questions. The first question related to hedging and given the gold price and prevailing spot, you know are we going to continue to hedge? And I think maybe that's appropriate if Deon answers.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Deon Louw</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thank you, Cobus. As I said in my section of the presentation, we hedged at a specific level, given the circumstances that was specific to that point in time. With the deleverage on all the group in the manner that we anticipate over the next 12 months, there should be no reason to hedge to the same to the same extent, if at all.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Cobus Loots</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Right, thanks. And I think we had a question on…</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yeah, we've got a question from [indiscernible] Capital.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Hi, guys, congratulations on your good results. First question is, why is your ADR in the states not trading it? And the second question is following the Q3 [GDXJ] rebalance recently, why is it that pan is not – it's still not part of the [GDXJ] given that you meet the criteria? Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Deon Louw</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thanks. Yeah. So, on the first point, we managed to put the ADR program in place. We couldn't push trading, because we were in a closed period until today. And you know, it's a new market for us and it’s a market unknown at this point. So, there will be quite a bit of focus from our side in terms of creating liquidity and creating awareness on Pan African and the U.S. market. So that's certainly is a focus area for us in the next six months or so. And then in terms of the index and our inclusion or not, you know clearly it is not our decision, you know, we had hoped it would be included in the [GDXJ], it doesn't appear to be the case this time around, but I do know it could yield – was said to be included in a number of other indices in the next week or so. So, I mean, certainly that's an ongoing initiative from our side also.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thank you. And there's one more question from Peter Cromberge, Mergermarket.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Peter Cromberge</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Could you provide further details regarding the expected terms of the funding package for Egoli, and the effect on the company's balance sheet?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Deon Louw</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Peter, we will in due course release the terms. The funding rate is very similar to what we have currently on our existing facilities, job all linked with a margin or around about 3.5% 3.75%. Security package will be very much what we already have in place. We have provided for a three-year drawdown period in the two phases that I referred to, and in a 24-month repayment period, once we’re in full production. That's a fully amortizing dedicated facility to the project. So, the whole idea is, with the facilities that itself redeeming from the proceeds of the Egoli project and so doing [indiscernible] upon the existing cash flows from the current operations.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thank you, Deon. We've got one more from Mark Du Toit, OysterCatcher Investments.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Mark Du Toit</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Two questions. You recently launched an ADR program. What was the reason for this? And secondly, what are the current wage agreements that you have in place?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Cobus Loots</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yeah, great. So, let's start with the wage agreements. The wage agreement that we have is still effective until 30 June, 2021, where after we’ll again negotiate. So, we have the next 12 months still under the existing three-year agreement. In terms of the ADR, yes, I mean, all of our South African peers have programs in place and the U.S. market is a market with incredibly deep liquidity and a lot of demand for gold at this point. So, we thought it appropriate to also be included in that market and that's why we went ahead with the idea.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay, and thank Cobus. Looks like there are no more questions. Do you have any concluding remarks?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Cobus Loots</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Well, just finally check whether we have any more questions from the conference call and if we have no questions, then we'll wrap it up.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">[Operator Instructions] We have a last question from Tim.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Tim Huff</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Just one follow up question on the Egoli financing package, if it is repayable from Egoli earnings when it's up and running, does that mean that the debt is held at the project level or at the company level? I'm just trying to figure out whether it will be included in the overall consolidated net debt figure.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Deon Louw </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">It will be. Look, all of our debt is funded through our treasury company and [on into] the subsidiaries. So, yes, ultimately the group stands behind the project. Although as we said, the repayment profile is sculptured to the cash flows from the project specifically.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Tim Huff </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">That's what I thought. That’s perfect. Thanks Deon.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Cobus Loots</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Thanks Tim. So, if there are no further questions, then, you know, thank you very much to all of you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking soon. All the best. Thank you.</p></div>
