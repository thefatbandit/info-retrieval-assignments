<p class="p p2">Mr. Cheung, please start your opening remarks.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Martin Cheung</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Thank you, Kevin.</p>
<p class="p p2">So let me start with a brief discussion on the performance of the 2020 first half. After slowing GDP growth in the fourth quarter 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic costs China's GDP declined by 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020, the worst year-over-year cause decline since 1992. The government's actions to limit the spread of the COVID-19 infection [indiscernible] and lockdowns which created an avoidable interruptions in employment, consumer, and industrial production, and service, as well as in the supply chain distribution in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
<p class="p p2">These interruptions affected the entire automotive industry in China, from material suppliers to distributors, manufacturers, workers, retailers, and service network. The overall Chinese unemployment rate rose to 6.2% in February 2020. The highest metal ever reported according to the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics, NBS. [indiscernible] which was essentially set down from late January for the Chinese New Year through mid-March including operations when government restrictions began to be lifted.</p>
<p class="p p2">The COVID-19 pandemic worsened a slowing Chinese economy and [indiscernible] which effected business confidence and industrial investments.</p>
<p class="p p2">In addition, the first phase of more stringent National VI emission standard and the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China were already negatively influencing the Chinese economy and auto industry for the COVID-19 pandemic stuff.</p>
<p class="p p2">According to data reported by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, CAAM, in the first quarter of 2020 unit sales of commercial vehicle including gasoline powered and electric power vehicles decreased by 25.7%. Truck sales decreased by 25.5%, with heavy duty truck sales down 15.6%. And truck sales decreased by 28%.</p>
<p class="p p2">However, the economy gradually began to improve in April and Chinese GDP grew around 3.2% rate in the second quarter of 2020. An improvement over the GDP reduction in the first quarter in China, but a much slower rate than in the past.</p>
<p class="p p2">The effective COVID-19 restrictions were still being felt in economy and affecting many economic decisions. Following the reopening of the Chinese economy in April, the government enacted economic catalyst to sustain and enhance growth, including [indiscernible] more infrastructure project was approved, taxes were cut, regulations loosens and lending rates and bank reserve requirements were lowered. Manufacturing activity responded and China's exports improved partially because China was among the first to ease lockdown actions.</p>
<p class="p p2">For the six months end June 30, 2020. CAAM data shows that commercial vehicles unit sales in China has strengthened and grown by 8.6% as truck sales increased by 10.8% more than offsetting a 12.4% sales decline into smaller market.</p>
<p class="p p2">Our revenue for the first six months ended June 30, 2020 was RMB822.7 million or US$116.5 million, compared with RMB1468.3 million in the first six months of 2019. Sales to the Chinese OEM market decreased by 35.1% year-over-year to RMB515.7 billion or US$73 million.</p>
<p class="p p2">Aftermarket sales decreased by 56.1% year-over-year to RMB223.9 million or US$31.7 million, and international sales decreased by 49.2% year-over-year to RMB83.2 million or US$11.8 million.</p>
<p class="p p2">Within a six-month revenue results, first quarter revenue was RMB320.8 million or US$45.3 million, compared to RMB669.4 million in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in revenue on a year-over-year basis was mainly due to the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent unprecedented lockdown and travel bans.</p>
<p class="p p2">Revenue for the second quarter increased 56.5% to RMB502 million or US$71 million from the first quarter revenue that was lowered year-over-year.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">Second quarter revenue was affected by reduce unit demand price competition in the domestic aftermarket, but straight towards more sales of lower price products and unprecedented transportation disruptions caused by continuing inter-provincial restrictions following the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in some OEMs using local suppliers interruptible production.</p>
<p class="p p3">We have recently experienced some customers now gradually shipping orders back to us since the restrictions have been lifted and our markets have been focused on regaining market share.</p>
<p class="p p3">In addition, our research and development has a history developing innovative real products to meet or exceed customer's requirements. Even in this turbulent marketplace, our high end tubeless wheels continue to be in high demand as there is little domestic competition in quality and performance to be real. For example, FAW, first auto-works has been a consistent buyer of our high end tubeless during the crisis.</p>
<p class="p p3">We increased our research and development investment in the first six months of 2020 as we are committed in creating unique wheel having the best quality and high performing yields in industry. Also at the end of the third quarter, the company entered into a large R&amp;D contract with a leading research institute in Beijing just to make more resources available.</p>
<p class="p p3">Our gross loss for the first six months ended June 30, 2020 was RMB6.3 million or US$0.9 million compared with a gross profit of RMB178.9 million during the same period in 2019. The gross loss was primarily due to drop in sales volume partially due to provincial transportation restrictions, and weak export demand combined with a low production utilization rate and price cuts following the unprecedented impact from COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p class="p p3">In such an uncertain market environment, we continue to remain financially strong. As of June 30, 2020 Zenix Auto had bank balances and cash of RMB671.3 million or US$95 million and fixed bank deposits with a maturity period over three months of RMB290 million or US$41 million. Total bank borrowings were RMB558 million or US$78.98 million. Total equity attributable to owners of the company was RMB2,294.6 million or US$324.8 million.</p>
<p class="p p3">As of June 30, 2020, we had cash per ADS of US$1.84 and net assets per ADS of US$6.29. Our current stock price we believe may represent a series undervaluation measured by a number of metrics used by the investment market. We are placing greater focus in reviewing our options to utilizing the company cash towards significantly improving the long-term value of our stock as we are committed to increasing shareholder value.</p>
<p class="p p3">For our future product strategy, we are continuing to leverage our strong R&amp;D program to bring differentiating products or technologically advanced products to the marketplace whereas the products fearlessly competing on pricing.</p>
<p class="p p3">And also for production placing an emphasis on greater automation reduction will enable us to reduce unit cost and improve profitability. In addition, we are reviewing the strategic positioning around manufacturing plants with the intense and quality operation to become overall more efficient producer.</p>
<p class="p p3">Upon completion consolidation will improve our unit cost through higher production utilization as we achieve greater economies of scale. These assets may take a little while to demonstrate their effectiveness but we are working towards our goals of being adaptable to changing market. In the past decade, Zenix became the market leader and reliable partner of our customer for three elements.</p>
<p class="p p3">First and foremost our reliable quality, secondly our ability to mass produce and lastly a strong new product R&amp;D capability. In today's environment, we believe that OEMs still highly value suppliers with these qualities. Despite the recent challenges, we will continue to bolster our core competencies as we’re able to guide our business to a strong recovery in the coming quarters.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">Before I review the results of our first two quarters of 2020, we will like to thank our employees, suppliers and customers, as well as the Chinese healthcare workers for their responsible efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, and we opened our operations without jeopardizing their health. As our production capabilities fully reopened all our facilities we remain hopeful for a better second half of the 2020 year.</p>

Revenue for the first quarter was RMB320.8 million or US$45.3 million compared to RMB669.4 million in the first quarter of 2019.

<p class="p p4">First quarter gross loss was RMB2.1 million or US$0.3 million, compared to a gross profit of RMB81.3 million in the same quarter in 2019. The negative gross margin in the first quarter was mainly due to the significant drop in sales volume, lower production utilization rate and wider than normal price cut following the unprecedented impact from COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p class="p p4">Selling and distribution expenses decreased by 35.2% to RMB25.6 million or US$3.6 million from RMB39.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in selling and distribution costs was primarily due to lower sales in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the same quarter last year.</p>
<p class="p p4">As a percentage of revenue, selling and distribution costs were 8% in the first quarter, compared to 5.9% in the same quarter a year ago.

<p class="p p4">In addition, the company entered into a large R&amp;D contract with a leading research institute in Beijing during the first quarter. The company continues to maintain new product development programs associated with new material development, new product design, and new production equipment development.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">Administrative expenses were RMB31.2 million US$4.4 million increased by 9.1% from RMB28.6 million in the first quarter of 2019.

The decrease in revenue on a year-over-year basis was mainly due to double threats of demand reduction and price competition in the domestic aftermarket segment.</p>
<p class="p p5">In addition, the unprecedented disruptions in inter-provincial transportation following the COVID-19 outbreak, which started in the first quarter of 2020, also caused some OEMs to move to use local suppliers to avoid interruption in their production. With the COVID-19 restrictions removed, recent sales indicate that customers are gradually moving their orders back to Zenix Auto in the second quarter of 2020.</p>

<p class="p p7">Now Kevin, that rounds up my presentation and we are ready for questions. Kevin?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Kevin Theiss</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Operator, we’re now ready for the Q&amp;A please.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p7"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from John Sheehy, a Private Investor. Your line is now live.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">John Sheehy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thank you for hosting the call and thank you for taking my question. Could you share some comment about the negative gross margin about the pressures on revenue and expenses?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Junqiu Gao</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, so there are two main factors attributable to - attributed to the negative gross margin in the second quarter. First is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic towards the rest of the world. As we all know, the second quarter China has come back or recovered and a lot of the business has reopened, but the second quarter hits the rest of the world the hardest, this pandemic hit the rest of the world the hardest.</p>
<p class="p p7">So - and also the tension between U.S. and China affected some of the - and many of those wheel companies where their business geared towards international sales, international market. These companies now had to resort to the domestic market to offload their product and to keep up with the production. And so - keep up with the production utilization, so that reason increased competition.</p>
<p class="p p7">And many of those competitors used to only - or mostly sell to the international market now. They are dropping the price and to compete with us in the domestic market. Due to this type of intense and fierce competition, we were forced to lower our selling prices at the request of many of our customers. So during the second quarter, on average we reduced our selling prices by 10% and that hit our margin.</p>
<p class="p p7">And the other contributing factor is the aftermarket. There's a couple of reason. And main issue is the increased campaign by the Chinese government, our anti-overloading policy, which affected the wear and tear - which would significantly reduce the wear and tear of those of the wheel products. So that in fact, also reduced the demand in the aftermarket for the replacement of the wheels.</p>
<p class="p p7">And in addition to that, it's just the economies and the logistics still on the recovery track, hasn't fully recovered from the pandemic and logistic market is still taking some time after the lockdown and travel restrictions to come back. And so, in coupling these two factors, we're seeing the aftermarket sales now accounted for much less of our total sales comparing with previous years and quarters.</p>
<p class="p p7">So to recap this, the negative growth rate is due to the price reduction following intense - market competition. And also the sales contribution from the aftermarket, where they normally carry a higher net profit margin for us, and now due to the decline of the aftermarket sales, the blended gross margin not taking a hit. I hope that answer your question.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">John Sheehy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, that's a lot of helpful detail. And then you also mentioned that you're reviewing consolidation of your manufacturing operations? Could you explain what you mean by that?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Junqiu Gao</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay. So regarding the consolidation of the production, let me give you example. Our long-term factory is situated - located in Hubei province. Hubei is very close to Beijing geographically. Due to the Beijing government and plus where the central government located, they tend to - whenever they do a large event, they tend to order the surrounding provinces to cut down the industrial production and for - whether environmental issues or other issues.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">So they - from time-to-time, our long-term factory will face a call from the government and that's - not only towards our power factory all industrial factory are ordered to suspend their production. And these kind of ongoing or from periodic orders, it disrupts our production. And we are reviewing this idle capacity due to the ongoing - in changes by the Beijing government. So what we're looking into is our northern China factory in [indiscernible] Zhangzhou Province.</p>
<p class="p p8">There is a - about our large production center for Northeast China and we already have a significant presence there. And now we want to move our land farm Hubei province, some of the equipment to [indiscernible] and to consolidate that, so that will help with our production utilization. That will also help with cost control. For many reasons we'll feel it will help us in today's environment.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">John Sheehy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">That sounds good. And then finally, you also mentioned that you are reviewing a shareholder return policy. Could you just describe in a little bit more specific terms what options you are considering?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Martin Cheung</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. Thank you, John, understand that a lot of shareholders has been with us for quite a long time. And we also believe I think the management is pretty serious that shareholders should be rewarded reasonably. And as I think we have been discussing this topic for quite a long time and so unfortunate as the plan of relisting or seeking another capital markets now seems a bit difficult.</p>
<p class="p p8">One thing because of the market or globally, it's not really performing that well. The other thing it's our profit, our business performance is not satisfactory to some extent that we - it's very difficult for us to find a capital market that we can meet the requirement for the time being. But having said that we are we are still open minded and we are monitoring to look into all sort of different alternatives to bring us back to a higher level capital markets instead of staying here to open up and let the company to have a better exposure in the capital market.</p>
<p class="p p8">And not just that, I think - we've been figuring out how to work out our resources, I think you see that we do have quite an amount of resources in our bank. And I think we do really need to mobilize some of the resources, either when it's to allow our management our senior management particularly and to set up some buyback plans. We are talking to the lawyers. We're talking to professionals how to work it out.</p>
<p class="p p8">We need time as one of the big hurdle is the foreign exchange is - there has been we've been headache we basically been struggling with this, but I think we are serious in this. And we are talking with the professionals and trying to work out some concrete plans.</p>
<p class="p p8">In event perhaps and definitely, this is another issue that we also will need to tackle with the foreign exchange problem as well but we do really need to work it out and we were working on it. John.</p>
