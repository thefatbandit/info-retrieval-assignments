<p class="p p1">Thank you, Olivia, and hello, everyone. In the first quarter of fiscal two 2021, we have been diligently cultivating our online education offerings to address students learning needs, especially when offline courses were restricted due to COVID-19.</p>
<p class="p p1">In addition, we continue to optimize offline resources for a more strengthened and cohesive online, offline approach to prepare ourselves for market recovery. Due to the prolonged pandemic containment measures and the restrictions on offline courses most of our classes were delivered online during the quarter.</p>
<p class="p p1">These will switch the transition to online right after COVID-19 outbreaks in early 2020. Our live streams and pre-recorded classes have received a very positive feedback from our students. Aside from academic subject and tutoring classes, we have also transitioned our featured interest based classes online to bring students more content that benefits their intellectual development and nurtures their interest to learn.</p>
<p class="p p1">To further strengthen our online capabilities with solid technical support. We made a strategic investment in Fuxi Network, an online education and training service provider, to sustain the long-term growth and development of our online education. Total student enrollments for the quarter decreased by 35% year-over-year, resulting from the impact by the COVID-19 and the related the regulatory uncertainties.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Additionally, regular school mandatorily deliver the classes online during the quarter. For the sake of Vision House, after a long time of using digital devices, students tend to have less preference in participating additional after school on courses.</p>
<p class="p p2">Enrollment for summer break learning were also impacted due to timeline uncertainties for reopening offline learning centers. Despite these unfavorable factors, it is encouraging for us to achieve 85% quarter-over-quarter enrollment growth.</p>
<p class="p p2">Even factoring in seasonality, this growth still demonstrate demand recovery from our students, and their interest in our quality courses. With a gradual resumption to normal daily life. Currently, over 90% of our existing learning centers have reopened for offline classes delivery.</p>
<p class="p p2">After receiving approval from government authorities, who have reviewed and evaluated the compliance status of our facilities. However, we are privileged to be selected again as an organizer of Trusted Summer Childcare, a project launch device, Shanghai Children Foundation and Shanghai Women’s Federation that aims to provide a pleasant environment and fulfilling some experience for the kids.</p>
<p class="p p2">Being the organizer of this special program demonstrates our best-of-class education, well equipped facilities and the high operating standards of our learning centers that have now been well recognized by government authorities.</p>
<p class="p p2">Generally speaking, we have expedited the digital transformation of operations and to the development of our online education during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, parents and students have been increasingly aware of the importance of offline courses that provide the direct in-person teaching and generally bring more effective learning results.</p>
<p class="p p2">We will continue to make efforts in building our learning center network and enrich our offline courses, which are consistently providing a considerable amount of online courses. We believe that this strategic OMO model will provide more flexibility to our students and allow us to quickly transition across delivery online in case of any negative pandemic development.</p>
<p class="p p2">More importantly, we believe our stellar reputation of high quality coupled with superior class experience, will allow us to continually attracting students through word-of-mouth referrals. We remain committed to serving students of all age with a broad array of classes and academic subject tutoring. Interested nurturing and intellectual development both at our learning centers and are on the online platform.</p>
<p class="p p2">Now let’s move on to the financial results. Amid the challenging market environment with many uncertainties, our top line performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was in line with our expectations. Impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and into lower enrollment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, revenue decreased by 33.7% year-over-year to RMB56.8 million.</p>
<p class="p p2">The softer top line performance created a pressure on margins and profit levels in the first quarter. However, enrollments are gradually recovered sequentially in the first quarter, driving our deferred revenue up by 46% compared with the level as of February 29 2020.</p>
<p class="p p2">In addition, we have been optimizing our learning centers for more efficient offline resource allocation, coupled with our best disciplined cost controls. So as to further reduce cost and efficiently manage our campus network. Our cash position also remain solid, demonstrates our health operations and enabling us to make prudent investments that are constructive for our future growth. </p>

<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p3"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Joy Wei with 86Research. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Joy Wei</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Hi management, thanks for taking my question. My question is regarding your guidance. Your guidance indicated a declining year-on-year. Could management help us understand the reasons behind? How much of the decline is due to the short-term summer vacations? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Yi Zuo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">As we mentioned that because you know the uncertainty of the summer break time schedule and the parents determination to involve their kids to the summer program has been impacted. That is one of the reasons. And also in some schools that - the second reason actually you know a lot of us on players issued some sort of cash - right, that you can get maybe for like 40 classes just for RMB1, and we are not doing that.</p>
<p class="p p3">So, the decline is a results of several factors. But in our view we believe it is short-term, because from the summer and our Four enrollments, we have seen that the trend is back. And over the summer, the parents are also somewhat concerned with the COVID-19 outbreak, the control measurement in the offline facilities.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">That is why we are putting more effort and resources in our online classes. For the four semester, we actually opened up both our online offline classes and try to make the OMO model more smooth. Yes. So that is the reason why to your question why we see a decline in the summer guidance.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Joy Wei</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it. So we are offering OMO models for the four semester. So do you have any expectation for the revenue outlook full-year fiscal 2021, considering that you are rolling out this new model and it might help you better retain and attract new students? Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Yi Zuo</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I'm not giving out full-year guidance on this call, but you can reach out to our IR and we can talk separately. But as I said, that China - The Education Administration also issued a new policy right [indiscernible], so we are making adjustment in all aspects to make us more competitive in the market and more adaptable to the market.</p>
<p class="p p4">We are also going to issue a new program, which is more tailored to classroom textbook. So, we are doing all kinds of things. And in general we are confident that the full-year outlook is in range with our internal guidance and our middle school business is coming up pretty nicely and we are making more investment in which we also believe will be a strong growth driver for the next quarters to come.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Joy Wei</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it. Thank you very much.</p>
