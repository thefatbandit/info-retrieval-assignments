<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Brent Thill</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Welcome back to the Software Conferences. Brent Thill, really happy to have with us Frederic Kerrest, Executive Vice Chairman and COO and co-founder of Okta. Big opportunity, amazing run. Maybe we’ll just kick-off just starting about the story. You’re rapidly approaching a billion in revenue, growing 35 plus percent a year, nearly 9000 customers. What is the secret sauce? What has caused this type of explosion? Walk us through it.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes, absolutely. Happy to do that. Thanks a lot for having me, Brent. I really appreciate it. Really excited to be here today. And I've really enjoyed the conference so far this morning. I know we have some exciting sessions this afternoon. So as you mentioned, we've been fortunate, business has been good. We are in our 12th year of business now. So certainly, we've come a long way since we started. My co-founder and I still run the company. We've gone from two to about 2500 employees, about 9000 enterprise customers; we just had a $200 million quarter last quarter. And it's growing nicely as you said.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, the main things that we're helping and so by the way, if you give me all those stats, as an entrepreneur, when we started, I would have gladly taken those in a heartbeat. I would have signed up for that twice. But the funny thing is that now based on where I am, and what I see, I think the next three, five, you know, we've been public 14 quarters, not that I'm counting, but if I were to be 14 quarters, that's all gone very well.</p>
<p class="p p1">But based on where we are today, and what I see going forward, I think the next 3, 5, 10 years are going to be way more exciting, way more interesting. I think we're finally starting to get to a size and scale where we can do things and these markets are really big.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, what's driving the business are three things in particular; I think the first one is just adoption of hybrid cloud technology. People always ask me, How is that possible? How are we still in the early innings of cloud? The reality of it is most of software is still purchased on premises. And most of enterprise IT is still hardware and services. So there's a long way to go to make it a software only in a cloud only world. And I think the opportunity to help large organizations and frankly, organizations of all sizes adopt modern cloud technology that's been a huge driver to our business.</p>
<p class="p p1">The second one is digital transformation, which is probably one of the most overused terms in technology over the last few years. But very simply just look at what's happened in e-commerce over the last six months. We've basically seen a doubling of the e-commerce as a percentage of commerce ratio since January alone of this year, and those numbers are not going backwards. So as everyone has to find better ways to interact with their customers, partners, vendors, suppliers, they need better websites, better mobile apps, and obviously identity becomes a key part of all that, who are your customers? How are they interacting with you? All those kinds of things.</p>
<p class="p p1">And then finally, digital security. Right. As everything moves online, as more and more people are focused on software, you certainly don't want it to be on the front page of The Wall Street Journal for all the wrong reasons and the acceleration in people working from home, phishing attacks, multi factor authentication, those are all big drivers to our business as well.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great, thanks for the -- thanks for the overview. Maybe just talk about the current environment and what's happened. Obviously, you saw, I think most the company saw the airbrakes come on, and in COVID, we figured it out. And in what are you seeing now coming out of this? How are -- how are customers behaving on, free and kind of post this period? </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes, well, it's unfortunate, obviously, to be in a global pandemic. And it's, it's even more disheartening or awkward to say that you're doing well in this global pandemic. But certainly, I think that the things that we focus on in particular focus on customer success has worked out really well for our customers and certainly for the business. When this all happened, starting in March and April, we really took a step back in the business quickly and said, hey, we need to focus on a couple things. First of all, the health of our employees and our families and our customers and all these kinds of things. Second of all, just customer success, just doing whatever we needed to make us get customers up and running and successful. We rolled out in emergency remote work program, which was Okta free for six months for applications for single sign on just so people could start using the service.</p>
<p class="p p2">And then finally, just making sure that, that we saw a massive increase in usage across things like multifactor authentication. So just making sure that the service was up and available and reliable and performing all those kinds of things. And that all went really well.</p>
<p class="p p2">I think, what we've seen really is what's happened over the last six months has really been a huge accelerant in some of those mega trends that I talked about earlier. Certainly, I think people are not looking to buy more on premises software. I think they understand that enterprise cloud is a good way to go. Once people focused on if you're in the Fortune 500 CIO of a Fortune 500 company, first thing you did in March or April is be like okay, how am I going to get all my employees at home up and running securely, safely access all their applications. After you did all that, you kind of took a breath and said great. What's going to happen next is this customer situation. I got to make sure we can interact with all of our customers, digital supply chains, all these kinds of things. So then we really saw a ramp up in customer data and access management, which is really gone well. I think the pipeline for the second half of the year is looking very strong and going into next year. I think people realize that this is a big opportunity, too, right?</p>
<p class="p p2">Once you kind of got everything settled down, it's a big opportunity to move your company forward to think about if you are going to take a big step digitally, you can doubt now do that. You have not only the wherewithal to do that, but you have the time, you certainly have the budget if you ask your board for it. And you underpin that with enhanced security across the board. I think those are things that people are all focused on.</p>
<p class="p p2">And then frankly, we saw deployments accelerate, right. So FedEx has been a good customer of ours for coming up on a year now. I've worked very closely with them. They signed a five year agreement last fall. A typical organization like FedEx, hundreds of thousands of employees have been around a long time. A lot of logistics, a lot on-prem, a lot of different constituents. It usually takes them a couple quarters to roll the service out. I talked to the CISO [ph] Gene on in, I think early February. He's like, yeah, Frederick, we're on track, we'll do like an April May roll out, no problem. And then I talked to him in like mid-March and he's like, I got an update for you. We need to go live with 85,000 employees and 250 apps this weekend.</p>
<p class="p p2">And we got that done, which is, which is great. It's a great testament to the service and also to all the prep that FedEx had done. But I think that's the kind of thing where and by the way, he was super excited about that. And it's a great proof point for us. I'm happy to point other customers to that and say, why don't you talk to Gene about it. But I think that's the kind of innovation you're seeing where people are saying, okay, I've done all the prep, now I got to get that going. And we saw a lot of that in the business and I expect to see that going forward as well.</p>

<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Zero to $25 billion in market cap. That I mean, it's an incredible…</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Is that what it is? I can't, I don't look at the stock. I can't look at the stock. I'm long in the stock. I got to stay that way.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">25 billion cap roughly. So when you think about kind of success that the company has had, there's always this worry about okay. The next leg of this and you just said, hey look, I'm more excited about what's going forward than what we just created. </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Absolutely.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">But what that motivation, what are the motivating factors? What's ahead that's so exciting, that maybe we can't see in Wall Street, but you're seeing on Main Street when you talk to your clients?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, well, absolutely. So I mean, the first one is if let's just take the macro macro view, which is just look at the size of these markets. So somehow there is $30 billion a year spent on legacy identity and access management for the workforce alone. So that's people still spending money on Oracle, on IBM on CAA on RSA, those two factor tokens that everyone carries around on their, on those on the key chain. So I mean, that's still a huge business and I'll talk a little bit about how we work with customers on that and what the prospects are, but I mean, that alone, just eating that business up over the next 5, 10 years, that's going to be a huge, that's going to be a huge opportunity for us, and one that we're really starting to see play out.</p>
<p class="p p3">And then on the customer day and access management side, like when we went public and I wrote the S1 registration document, three and a half years ago now, we had basically a Tam of 18 billion, which was all workforce. Customer identity management is traditionally been a build-your-own, all this kind of thing that's now looks like north of $20 billion of market as well. So instantly, we've got $50 billion year of market that's being spent every year on legacy software, on build-your-own infrastructure. And that is growing very fast. And that's why I say great, I'm very happy about the results. But now we look like a small business compared to what we could potentially be.</p>
<p class="p p3">So if you break that down, you look at the workforce side of life, one of the -- one of the great things and you see it in the metric, right. We've had 115, 120% dollar based net retention for as many cores as I can remember, it's actually been over 120 last couple quarters because especially in this pandemic, right. I think what you're seeing is large enterprise are just continuing to buy from vendors where they're very comfortable with and obviously Okta is one of those and benefiting from that.</p>
<p class="p p3">But when I go in and I talk to a FedEx or a John Deere or one of the larger organizations. I'm not going in with some story about a forklift upgrade of their entire Oracle and IBM stack and they're not going to see any value for the next three years. I go in and I say, hey, Brent, nice to see you. Look, leave all that IBM stuff running its legacy, but it's plugged into a bunch of on-prem stuff. Talk to me about your three biggest opportunities right now.</p>
<p class="p p3">And you'll say, Oh, I'm looking to roll out, office 365 to 100,000 employees around the world, or I'm looking to roll out a workday at scale. Or hey, guess what I got to launch a new mobile app and website for all the millennials, because instantly all my business has gone online. And I say, great, that's something we can help you with.</p>
<p class="p p3">And so we work on that opportunity with you 3,6,9 months come back to you say how is that and a lot of times people say that was a great experience. And that gives us the right now you've gotten to know us, our company, our products, our platform, kind of how it all works. And that's given me the right to come back to you and say great. Now Brent, let's look at that old IBM Tivoli Tim and Tam stuff you have, and let's map out the 24 month roadmap to take that stuff and just eliminate it.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">And that's how you're going to slowly start to see that bit. And that's just going to roll for a year for quarters and years ahead, there's a huge amount of that legacy workforce infrastructure that we're really going to be able to help people with. And what we do today is identity. As you can imagine, there's adjacencies, there's Pam, there's IGA, there's all sorts of stuff that's going to naturally shift to the cloud. And as it does, I think we'll be very well positioned there.</p>
<p class="p p4">On the customer identity management side, I think what people don't realize and why this is kind of come out of nowhere is the competition is build-your-own. And look, you and I have had logins to amazon.com for 20 years, having a username and a password doesn't seem that complicated. But it's starting to get more complicated, right. You need to have two factor authentication, you want to stamp the machine to make sure that the right person is coming from the right place. You want to make sure that the password reset flows are going to multiple different email addresses in the right way. And all these kinds of things get pretty complicated. Number one.</p>
<p class="p p4">Number two, shortage of over 200,000 developers in North America alone today, and our universities are only printing 30,000 a year. So if there was no software growth going forward, which of course we all know there's going to be a lot of it. But assuming there was zero growth, seven years just to catch up, what does that mean? That means if you're a Fortune 500 company operating in the Midwest, you have a shortage of developers. I don't care how awesome you are the best developers. Okta, get some, Google get some, Facebook get some. John Deere and FedEx, they're doing their best, but they're not going to get as many developers as they need. So they've got -- they've got really limited precious resources.</p>
<p class="p p4">Now, if you're John Deere, what's your business? Technology's taken over everything, you got to put more GPS in the tractors, you got to get them to go straight, you got to get him to work perfectly. You want to make it easier for customers to buy them. So just putting the technology in your own products is what's going to be the most valuable thing for you to do with your developers, not running an Exchange Server, not running an Identity Management Server, and certainly not setting up new websites for customers.</p>
<p class="p p4">And so as people are getting more used to okay, I can take payments off the shelf -- off the shelf with stripe and put them in my app. I can take messaging off the shelf with Twilio and put it in my app. We want them to think oh, I can take identity off the shelf, and just put it in my app. and make it much easier. And you know a lot of people need payments, a lot of people need messaging, everyone needs identity.</p>
<p class="p p4">I mean, identity is inside every single application that we use as consumers or in the enterprise. And I think that's the big opportunity for us in the times ahead. Look, it's already -- customer identity and access management is about a quarter of our business up from 0, 3 or 4 years ago, and it's growing north of 70%, year-over-year. So workforce identity management is going to be slow and steady and continue to go. And there's a long, long runway for us there. And I think it's going to do very well. But customer identity and access management is going to be a big opportunity, too. We're investing heavily into it. We just hired a great leader to run it. We're really doubling down. I think it's going to be -- it's going to be very interesting, exciting to see how it goes in the times ahead.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, just on a customer identity. When you think about the awareness build of where you're at with this, just give a sense. I mean, it seems like its super early innings, but like you said, it's more roll your own. So this just seems ripe. When we look at everything that we're buying online, all the systems are engaged with like, they don't -- they don't annoy him.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">That's exactly right. So we have certainly like we have plenty of very good examples of early like we run JetBlue, TrueBlue system. We run mlb.com for the 60 plus million fans who log-in to stream content every year. You can kind of go down the list. But it also starts to get pretty interesting. You think about an organization like Albertsons, big customer of ours, they own 27 brands, right? Vons, Safeway, all these different brands. Now, you might have different numbers -- affinity numbers at Safeway than you do at Vons. And you might use it at checkout, you might use it a gas station, but like you don't remember all your points.</p>
<p class="p p5">So you're like, I just want one central number across all these different properties. And on the back end, they want even more. Because they don't know that, Brent, Safeway's is the same Brent at Vons. And so they want to be able to upsell you, cross- sell you, give you promotions when you go into the different stores. It seem like they should all be figured out, but these are very basic opportunities that everyone's going to have to deal with. And I think it gives us a big opportunity there.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">When you think of the pricing mechanism for customer identity, how do you -- how are you pricing this out? What are you seeing in terms of economic value back to you for the solution?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, absolutely. So workforce identity management is per user per year, your ENGIE formerly GDF SUEZ you have 120,000, 150,000, seats, wall-to-wall of our different products, universal directory, single sign-on, multi year contracts, all annual cash up front, all these kinds of things. On the customer identity and access management side, we really want to align our success with customer success. So we don't charge you to load the database. So MLB doesn't pay for the 60 million consumers they put in there. They pay for monthly active users. So at opening day they're going to have maybe a burst of a few million or something and then they're going to have hundreds of thousands that login every day throughout the course of the summer. And that's -- so our incentives are very much aligned with theirs and as they are more successful, we get more successful to.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And you mentioned you hired a new go-to-market leader there. Can you just double click on that and kind of the go-to-market motion for customer identity in what you're doing?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, absolutely. Well, we actually hired a new leader overall for customer identity and access management. Because if you think about the natural motion of the company, we started as a workforce identity management company, right? I mean, 10 years ago, there was no customer identity and access management. And it's also kind of where we came from, right? My co-founder and I were at Salesforce early on. We saw this problem from the employee side. So we really -- there's so much natural momentum inside the company, we see this big customer identity and access management opportunity. We want to make sure we're taking advantage of it. So we're really bolstering up the leadership to focus on driving customer identity and access management. We have an overall GM of it. We're hiring a lot more leadership when it comes to engineering, development, sales as well. So we're really good at selling up high. We're also trying to build up that developer motion. We bought an organization called Stormpath has been a very good addition to Okta.</p>
<p class="p p5">When we went public three years ago, one of the best identities for bottoms up, developer motion, libraries, sample code, relationships, all these kinds of things. So our DevEx motion is really starting to go and I expect to see a lot of progress in the next six to 12 months. And as people are out there and they're googling and they're trying to find what the right information is to try and sample all these things, we want to make it super easy to try Okta. So developer.okta.com is totally redone. It's really started starting to take a front and center place. And what we're trying to do is to go-to-market motion and I'm very optimistic about what's going to happen here in the course and years ahead.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">It doesn't feel like this is like a sugar rush where everyone went back and kind of didn't do anything and all of a sudden we snap back. It feels like this has got durable, recurring visibility. This isn't like a flash in the pan, to your point like this is -- these are very durable trends are going to last for quite some time?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">These are mega trends. And we are in the early innings of these things. And so, I mean, here's a little bit -- I know you're a data guy. So here's a little bit of data. If you look at from 2009 to 2020, over 10 years, 2010 to 2020, enterprise IT grew from about 3.2 trillion to about 3.8 trillion. So that's 20% growth on a pretty big number. That's good. Enterprise software went from about 220 billion to about 440 billion. So that's doubling, which is great. Enterprise software as a service, when we go enterprise cloud now, went from like 7.5 billion to just north of 100 billion now. And you're like, wow, look at that. That's 12x growth. Yes, but look at the ratios, we're at $100 billion to $115 billion of enterprise cloud, versus $440 billion of enterprise software. So it's a quarter. And versus enterprise IT of $3.8 trillion, it's like 3%.</p>
<p class="p p6">So first of all, that means $0.75 cents of every dollar spent this year on enterprise software is spent on premises. And the cloud -- and so, I'm not telling you everything is going to go to the public cloud. But certainly, I think all this context software, all the stuff that is not a sustainable competitive differentiator for you and your business, it is going to go to the cloud. People should not be running exchange servers. They should not be running SFA. They should not be running HR financials. They should be outsourcing this to people who do it at scale professionally for everyone. And they should focus. Again, their scarce resource developers on the things that are going to move the needle for their business. And so people always like how's it possible that you say you're in the early innings. You look at those numbers. Its like by far the biggest opportunities in the trends of hybrid IT, digital transformation, digital security are in the years ahead, and I think we're very well-positioned for that.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So, when you think about the gear up for this and your direct go-to-market motion in the field. Can you just help us everyone understand the investments you're putting in your direct field, the inside kind of partnerships? What -- when you look at that distribution funnel, how do you describe kind of -- are you doubling down now, coming out of this, or you just kind of at same pace at the beginning of the year that you've taken? How do you -- how you approaching this?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, absolutely. So, I mean, I think we were -- I like to think that we run the business as responsible mature adults. So when all this happened in February, March, we like took a quick pause. We're able within a couple weeks to just like, take a breath, look at everything that was happening, make sure that we're doing all the right things. I think we did all that. I think what we're seeing now is we're really coming out of this. The second half pipelines looking very, very strong. I'm very excited about what's going to happen next year already. Obviously, we're getting into towards the end of the year, so we're already well into the fiscal planning for fiscal year 2022. And I'm very optimistic.</p>
<p class="p p6">So we're going to -- we're hiring across the board, if you know anyone good in any different division, sales or anything customer facing product engineering, and I think we're going to continue to see that through the end of the year and into next year. So I think there's very good prospects and we are definitely going to be investing into the opportunity.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Just on the back end for your cloud, what is powering at your back end right now?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">We run our service today on AWS. So we have been since we started the company, very good relationship with Andy Jassy and the entire team there. They started to kind of 2006, 2007, 2008 really getting out there. We start in 2009. So it was kind of a big bet. But it worked out really well. We use a bunch of their services, very good relationship with their field sales organization. We're starting to sell a lot with them, because as they get into bigger and bigger opportunities, they're looking for services that offer more than their services do. And obviously, they're focused on selling AWS stuff, customers want multi cloud and we played. We're the best ones to play there, right?. We're the preferred vendor for Office 365. We do the best with AWS. And we're the preferred vendor for GCP. So whatever customers are trying to do in this multi cloud world, we're there to help them out with that. And AWS has worked out very well. And I think going forward we're going to make sure that we can kind of be supported on all these different clouds as people are thinking about that. And we're very bullish about the opportunity there.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">We've had a handful of identity companies. And I know it's a, it's a big bucket. And there's a lot of different areas. And it's a big market. But many have kind of asked like, what is this when they look like in three years? And what this the space look like? Is it big enough to support all these vendors? Are we going to see more consolidation? I don't expect you to name names, but just kind of how you think about what happens in the overall space?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. Well, I think there's kind of two big vectors. The first one is there's this -- I think there's a significant difference between legacy vendors, on-prem software vendors that we've already talked a little bit about and what's going to happen to them, and the modern cloud based version. So if you look at folks like Oracle, IBM, CA, Ping Identity. on-premise infrastructure, that's slowly but surely going to go away. They're going to be living off main streams for a while, but I think that business you're going to see that kind of tail off in the coming years. And I think that's a big opportunity for us. And then I think people realize that cloud is the future. And so obviously, we're well positioned there. But beyond just that dichotomy, I think, also starting an identity, I think that gives us a very strong starting point. I think there's a lot of different things we can do.</p>
<p class="p p7">For example, today, we have great partnerships with CyberArk and SailPoint, in PAM and IGA. But as people are putting more and more things into the cloud, they're calling us more and more and saying, hey, if I already have all my identity information in the cloud, when I want to do governance and attestation about that identity information, why am I going to bring it back on-premises to do that information that was already sitting in the cloud. So when you see a lot of those things, and you see these trends that we talked about how early it is, but what's going to happen with this big shift? I think there's going to be a lot of opportunities for us to provide modern versions of these legacy solutions in the cloud. And I think that, beyond just the TAMs we talked about, I think there's a lot of adjacencies that are going to continue to grow. And those are going to be good opportunities for us to provide good solutions for our customers.</p>

<p class="p p7">Is there, as a founder and running a company right now I know you're -- you look across tech and you're a big investor in a lot of different names. Is there is there a couple big areas not to name names, but anything you're seeing like, wow, this is kind of still -- this is a really big opportunity that we don't address, but maybe as you look at is something interesting that we should be focused on?</p>

<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Frederic Kerrest</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. I mean, we actually try -- we do try and think about it at Okta. We started Okta ventures which is our corporate venture capital arm. Last year, about 15 months ago now, we've done I think, eight investments. And what we're looking for there are early seed Series A investments, in security and privacy, in threat detection, in intelligence management, where we can really help our customers by understanding what's on the forefront of all these things. So, first thing is, I think the Okta ventures portfolio is doing very well. And frankly, I think we're adding a lot of value to those companies. We are seeing more and more deal flow from really quality investors bringing us into those rounds. So I think that that's great. But then I also think I mean, it's probably not going to sound too new to you, obviously, who's an expert in this, you're just going to see more and more stuff around remote work.</p>
<p class="p p8">I mean, the legacy enterprise software of days of old is gone; people are not going to be renewing these big implementations of on premises, Oracle and IBM and CA. They're not going to be looking to put more stuff in their data centers. I think everyone just got a pretty rude awakening about how challenging it can be to get into your data centers physically, when you have situations like what we just had. And it gives all the very forward thinking, CXOs at large organizations and opportunity to say, great, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to use this as an opportunity to step function forward in my technology vision. And I think you're going to see a lot of innovation then in the times ahead.</p>
