<p class="p p1"><strong>Brent Thill</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Welcome back to the software conference. It's Brent Thill at Jefferies. Very pleased to have with us Dan Springer, CEO of DocuSign. Dan has been instrumental in helping run this to a $37 billion market cap and transforming the story. Prior to DocuSign, Dan served as the Chairman and CEO of Responsys through led the sale of the company to Oracle for $1.6 billion. Dan, thanks again for joining.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Brent Thill</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Maybe just to start-off, give us your view on kind of what's happening in your world that just at [Indiscernible]. Obviously, you've got incredible momentum and just bring us up to speed in terms of your high-level thoughts on what's happening with the company's future?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Springer</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Sure. I think there's two things I'd probably point you, Brent as it define my perspective on where we are in the marketplace. The first one is around our product market strategy and the second one is just what's happening in the economic environment, demand environment from standpoint of COVID.</p>
<p class="p p1">From overall, our product vision a couple of years ago, we came to this realization that while eSignature was clearly what brought us sort of to the dance, so to speak, and will be the dramatic driver of our business for years to come, but our customers want to look broader, and we've really characterized this as the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. So instead of just signing documents, people needed to able to prepare and then after they've been signed, take actions on those agreements, connecting to other software, et cetera, and then manage that body of agreements that they have, and storing those agreements that being able to do intelligence search against them, managing obligations across those.</p>
<p class="p p1">And so that's kind of the core of what we're trying to do is say, we're going to help you prepare, sign, act, and manage all of your agreements. And we think this going to be the next big cloud opportunity and we feel excited about our progress.</p>
<p class="p p1">And then on the demand side, we started the year, we feel pretty good. February 1st is when our New Year starts. We are halfway through the quarter. We're having an excellent quarter. And then COVID hit and two very dramatic things happen. One, we ended up having all our employees work from home, which has been non-trivial and not enjoyable for many of us.</p>
<p class="p p1">Clearly, we're fortunate compared a lot of other companies in these kinds of situations. But the other was we saw an acceleration in some demand from for people, who realize that they need to get their digital transformation of their business to accelerate to go faster.</p>
<p class="p p1">And so we had -- yes, we had to blow out Q1 and Q2 at bookings growth -- billings growth, rather, of 59% and 61% the first two quarters. We one-time -- we had 147% quarter last year for billings growth, but otherwise, have never been above 40%. So, this was quite unusual to get that extra boost. But we're really pleased to be filling that demand. We don't think it's going to change anytime soon.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Just on that comment, I think everyone's asking the durability of what many of the software companies are seeing with the pandemic. And I think we're both coming from California, the fires, everything is kind of changing our war halt. So, it's not just what's happening with COVID. There's other things that are happening that are reshaping how we need to act just how things. And so maybe just talk to your sense of the durability and what you think about this whole digital transformation, how long-lasting can this be?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Springer</span></strong></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Yes, I had two perspectives to that. One, with an incredibly high degree of confidence and one that I say, a degree of confidence. The first piece is for the transformation we've had to-date, there's been a lot of questions about, if people brought up into the DocuSign world that once we're in a -- whatever a new normal might look like, not everyone working from home will somewhat pullback and I feel very strongly the answer is people don't go back.</p>
<p class="p p2">When you've taken the opportunity to transform your processes to a digital solution and think about it in our core signature business, it means people are having much -- a more attractive ROI from that move. They save a huge amount of money. They're not FedEx-ing documents back and forth or hand delivering. Documents are not manually processing, so much information they can deliver through technology, not only for sending out but everything can come back, but those app space we talked about, to integrate with the other software systems.</p>
<p class="p p2">Our clients will see incredible cost savings and a better end customer experience. So the folks that they're transacting with and doing agreements say, hey, this is a better way to work with you. And employees realize, some people have changed management challenges, once they get to the other side, obviously, no one's going back. So, we don't feel there's a sense of stuff that's accelerating this year will disappear.</p>
<p class="p p2">The more interesting question we want to have conviction, but it's less clear to me is, what will then sort of the normal for our growth look like. And what will the new normal for the world look like? I think the answer is, we've seen in our own business. We're not going to have 100% of the people that we used to have full-time in the office. Full-time in the office, and people realize there's a lot of roles that people can do, partially work from home.</p>
<p class="p p2">And a lot of our employees are saying -- well, those employees desperately going back to the office, because they're having a hard time doing everything from home. And I relate to that, or feeling not as connected to their colleagues, but we also see a lot of our employees are saying, hey, I have to imagine doing this. Not having a commute and make me want to do this, at least part time.</p>
<p class="p p2">So, I think, whatever the new normal is, I think, we will have an increased demand from what we had prior, but I don't know that it'd sustain. If you look at the guidance we've given for the second half of this year, it's not at the same rate of billings growth or revenue growth we had in the first half, because that was unusually heightened demand. So, we're trying to moderate that and get a sense of what that longer-term thing will look like. But I think the answer is, it will be strong, but I don't think, it will be as strong as it was in the first half.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">To follow up on the point where kind of the eSignature gets you, but now you've got this broader platform around Agreement Cloud, now, maybe just talk to this transformation and what this is going to look like over the next three years for you?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Springer</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. Yes, I think, this content of moving to a broader platform, it's always a little bit daunting, right? It's a change from being a core single-product company. That adds complexity to the business. But I think the reason I feel good about it is, it's driven by our customers. It's our customers saying, these are the things we need to do and we'd like to have DocuSign into a broader solution for us. So, we feel a lot of confidence and it's the right answer, because it's a customer-driven answer.</p>
<p class="p p2">And then, in terms of what it'll look like for us, we've done a couple of acquisitions. And we bought a company called SpringCM just about two years ago, and that was a foundation for building DocuSign CLM. And I think that's now -- Gartner has us in the upper right quadrant top two companies in the space, which we feel great about. In a fairly quick amount of time, we achieved that. We think we’re going to continue to invest aggressively in the CLM space, same what we did in eSignature, allow us to continue to be a leader there.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">The other big one was Seal Software, which we closed in May of this year. And Seal is a company we'd already been partnering with, in fact, jointly selling with around intelligent insights. And really, this is an artificial intelligence perspective to what we call agreement analytics, helping people get more information about the agreements they've done. So one, they can run their agreement processes better. But two, they can run their business better. And we've seen some great financial services use case. One of my favorites is and everyone knows how many banks and financial institutions had done contracts that were denominated off of a LIBOR, so LIBOR plus two as an interest rate.</p>
<p class="p p3">So now with LIBOR going away, we have all these institutions going back. So what are all the agreements I have that have LIBOR turned in. I got to find those and uptake those agreements because it's not going to be available anymore. And so that's an example where the software can help people do intelligence search to find all of the types of agreements in their organization that might have the churn, so they can replace them, they can negotiate whatever new terms they're going to negotiate with the counterparties. And that's a great example of how intelligent analytics will help you run your business better.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">You mentioned, it's hard to understand what the new normal will be. Demand is going to be up. But many have asked just in terms of how you're thinking about the guidance and what factors are one-time versus longer term and how you factor that into your guide?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Springer</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. I think the way -- we try to be consistent. Mike has done this historically in his five years here, well, I guess, 2.5 years the public company, but we spent about a year for that doing a mock quarterly earnings process when we would actually go through the process of saying what are our results and what would our -- as a public company what our guidance be in this scenario.</p>
<p class="p p3">So I think we've got a pretty good time tested model, and Cynthia is excited to pick that up. And we're sort of fortunate that we have this transition time because Mike has taken the international leadership role that he and Cynthia can overlap for so much time. And for the next set of months, we really have an opportunity for -- to make sure we just have a seamless transition. But I think you'll see the same thing from Cynthia. She is in audit committee chair. So she's been involved in this for the last couple of years.</p>
<p class="p p3">But this content, Brent, we're going to guide to what we really have visibility for. So we're going to look out there. And we're going to say, in this case, in fact we give it to Q3 and Q4 because we're giving the total year in Q3. But the visibility we have is going to be stronger in the near-term quarters and last -- in later term quarters just because that's the deals we see. That's the customer conversations we're having that are more prominent because of their timing. But we don't see anything from the longer term that see any significant change from this concept that we had our core growth rates. Now, I think, they're going to be a little bit higher because of an increased work-from-home environment. That's kind of, I think, the story we see for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="p p3">And then the tricky part to your question is -- to give that, how do you give guidance on this phenomenon that you see is there, but it's a conceptual push versus seeing actual deals. And so seeing the actual deals, it's easier to see Q3 than it is Q4 right now because we're partly in it. And that's why you see the higher guidance in Q3 and Q4.</p>
<p class="p p3">It's not that we don't think Q4 is going to be strong. We don't want to guess what's going to happen. We're just saying, we’re going to try to give you those guidance. We actually can see it. That's what we can do for Q3.</p>

<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">For investors that haven't heard this, Dan was on a great podcast with Bessemer, called Cloud Giants, and -- Dan had explained, kind of, a lot of his philosophies, and it was a great session. I learned a lot about how you lead.</p>
<p class="p p4">One of the things that was striking that you had said in the podcast about your time at Responsys is you maybe wish you would have invested more given the demand that it happened or -- and miss -- correct me if I'm wrong. But when you look at the opportunity now, where you said the type of demand you're seeing, does that change your thesis in terms of how much you want to put in, invest? Or do you feel like the investment processes are in, you feel comfortable with where you're at right now?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Springer</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. So in some ways, there -- it's a great question, very different. It's funny, your question -- it's a very different situation. I have a lot of love for Responsys. Actually, I guess, taking from Responsys $400 [ph] as we speak. It was a great experience. We had a 10-year run. It was awesome.</p>
<p class="p p4">Responsys, the issue that came up is when I joined the company a bit of a turnaround, and there was a viability question at the very beginning 10 years in -- one year in and 10-year gate. And I was more conservative, I think, about growing that business because I think we had, sort of, the near-death experience.</p>
<p class="p p4">I think the company needed to feel safer. But in hindsight, I think it was a mistake because other people came into what was a very competitive space in e-mail marketing. And we probably could have finished with an even stronger outcome and even stronger leadership position in the space, if we maybe push the pedal to the metal. We are highly efficient, which is a good thing, but we probably could have been a little more aggressive on growth.</p>
<p class="p p4">I kind of -- as we're getting ready to go public, I was going to -- get to that point where someone's too late and you get your growth profile. You explain to the street what you're going to do, what your profitability profile is. It's harder than little possible, hard to sort of switch and say, hey, guys, we're recently -- current public company. Now I want to really much more aggressive with our spending. But you could have done that, but I think it would have taken a lot of conviction, and we had it quite that much.</p>
<p class="p p4">DocuSign is very different in that when I came in, we had the opposite scenario. The company is growing like crazy, losing tons of money, but a great -- clearly going to be a great company. When I joined, it was more a sense of, yes, I got to get that -- spend a little bit under control, but basically, we want to keep our focus on growth. And what Mike and I have said for years here is that we're focusing, trying to find that apex of the growth opportunity here.</p>
<p class="p p4">And we believe our investors are saying, we care about the operating income. We'd like to see some progress towards the long-term model, but do you see opportunities to slow the progress on profitability side to increase the opportunity to grow faster with growth, that's what we've said we're going to do and that's what we here is a fundamentally request from our investors as they are looking at the opportunity with DocuSign. And that's what we're going to do.</p>
<p class="p p4">So I don't have any concern that my conservatism at Responsys will play over to DocuSign because that's just a different animal. And the last thing to think about is Responsys had an incredibly aggressive competitor set with it, that when I joined, nothing too much Responsys target. But when I joined, we were 13th in Forrester Wave. Unfortunately, sort of a Gartner type wave in that space. So that's pretty bad.</p>
<p class="p p4">We had 17 companies covered. We were 13th. So we had a very different approach. At the end, we ended up first in the Forrester Wave for the last three years. They did it when I was there, but that was a lot of work to get done. But at the DocuSign, we are the dramatic and clear leader in our space. We are six times the next biggest player, which is that the EchoSign product Adobe want. So it's a very different competitive mindset. And this is about leadership, and this is about investing to grow.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">That's great. Just on the product side, you brought in a new CTO, Kamal. Maybe if you could just talk to what the important components Kamal will be focused on going forward?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Springer</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. So I think the way to think about it is Tom Casey, who runs our overall product organization and sets all the product management engineering and that kind of that core infrastructure that we have. And for those that aren't as familiar, the vast majority of our tech stack and our operations are around. So we don't use very much on the public cloud. We've built a network of data centers in Europe, in North America that we sort of delivered an assets majority of our service. So that's a big -- that infrastructure is a big part of what Tom oversees.</p>
<p class="p p5">So what we've asked Kamal to do is to come in and take a big piece of that and really think about the platform. So that's thinking about the actual physical platform that we have, but also sort of the underlying platform for the Agreement Cloud. And Tom has been focused much more on the leadership of all of our products and engineering teams that build our eSignature product that build our CRM product, that build our advanced analytic product. He can really focus on in his love of building software. And Kamal’s CTO will really think about that underlying infrastructure, both physical and software. And I think it's going to be a great match, and they actually have worked together at Microsoft years ago and have a really strong relationship. We've actually been talking to Kamal for about a year and half, trying to just figure out the right sort of model to get him on board. So, we're thrilled to have found that right fit and that right match and have him here.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">You mentioned earlier Mike's push to international. I think the international business is a $200 million rev, reporting close to 60% growth. It seems like it's doing pretty well. But, when you kind of highlight or articulate the international opportunity, can you just maybe walk through what are the biggest areas for you to go after there? How do you segment that market?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Springer</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. So you'd not be surprised, given you know Mike. We've got a plan. This is not a casual entry. And so just quick little history, people don't know or missed our earnings call, but really near the beginning of this year, middle of February, Mike had sort of come to me and come to the whole e-staff and said, hey, guys, look, we continue to have a great international business. It's growing at a good clip, but it's not growing that much faster than our North American business. And that's why it's not taking share. It's like being sort of stuck on 18% of our revenue. I think for a company at our scale, it should be higher than that.</p>
<p class="p p5">We've all sort of said that, but we just weren't sort of mobilizing his leadership team to attack as an opportunity. And Mike said, look, I've seen a lot of stuff in EMEA that I can think about how we might coordinate better the go-to-market functions. So Mike sort of led an effort and had a bunch of its engaged, and we went over to Dublin and pull our European leaders together and put together some plan.</p>
<p class="p p5">And actually, in a few months, we felt, wow, this is doing good. When I actually looked at that growth rate, the revenue growth rate of almost 60% in Q2, we think a lot of that's attributed to our biggest international market, which is Europe. And the growth we had there, somewhat driven by the work.</p>
<p class="p p5">And so, as we start seeing that improvement, Mike and I started talking, wow, this is something we really could do on a broader international scale. And that's just phase one, which is get our coordination and operations better. And I'll talk about phase two and phase three in a second, but that was kind of the impetus to start thinking about it.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">And Mike and we're excited about that work, and start saying I want to put more time into it. I was sort of stuck a little bit and saying kind of need a CFO to a company and you're a good one, and we start having this conversation, and then we were to tell Cynthia at the same time, because she’d have been the CFO at Pivotal, Pivotal got bought out back to Dell. And so, we ended up in a situation where we’re, sort of, wow, if these things can happen at the same time that will be fantastic.</p>
<p class="p p6">And the third piece, again, which almost makes it feel -- 2Q by half, we were talking about bringing some great board members on that also had financial leadership and so, Teresa Briggs and James Beer. And so all of a sudden, just kind of a three-way move, sort of, made sense to bring on the new financial expertise on board. Cynthia jumps in the CFO spot and that Teresa, Mike to promote up to the International opportunity.</p>
<p class="p p6">And that was just kind of came together, we just sort of saw all the pieces in that puzzle and made that move. So, I feel really good about this. So, it's all adequate. We've had a great new board's strength. We've added fantastic new executive that is Cynthia who is CFO. We don't lose anything. We still got Mike leading, I think, is the biggest single growth opportunity we have in our business that we haven't tapped as well as we could, which is International growth.</p>
<p class="p p6">And so now we ticked up 18% to 19% of revenue in this last quarter, which is also nice and I can see that tick up. And we won't necessarily get one every quarter, but I'd like to start getting an increase in our few quarters in that International growth. And it's going to be hard and I can tell you, it's a high-class problem. Our domestic business is growing incredibly well. So, we're taking share from that, is no easy piece, but I think with Mike's leadership there, we will.</p>
<p class="p p6">And then just quickly, phase 1, which is just kind of the coordination of the go-to-market functions, really just operating really well. When you grow fast, sometimes you -- kind of don't have that same operational excellence.</p>
<p class="p p6">Then phase 2 as I think about the portfolio of International markets. Once we took, we've got the ones we've got running the way we want, should we be entering direct businesses in more countries? Should we not? Should we be e-commerce readiness? We got to look at it as a really strategic side to this, which I think we really want to put a lot of our senior team focus with lead on it. </p>
<p class="p p6">And then third is we'll have to think that once the organization future, as you know most software companies at some point get to a scale, but they don't sort of operate in geographic model. They sort of have in Asia-Pacific business or North -- or Americas business or EMEA, we'll probably at some point, think about that. Right now, we're not changing our old structure while we're keeping things core, but that'll probably be the third phase. That might be maybe two years from now, but that's kind of the vision for what Michael said to do in transforming our business.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">You recently acquired Liveoak, an Austin-based start-up that power's remote agreements. Anyone that's gone to a notary doesn't want to go back. What's the opportunity here for you?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Springer</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">There's two ways to think about it. There's an economic one and -- in terms of like the TAM, and then there's the opportunity, as you said, which is like we can make this a whole lot better. As we've done eSignature, we can do the same thing with notary. And so from a business standpoint and TAM, we think it approaches about $1 billion TAM for the first piece we're going after. And I think we could imagine ourselves having pretty good share.</p>
<p class="p p6">So, I think it's going to be a meaningful opportunity. But the driver for it has really come from our customers and interestingly, the experience you're describing, like if I think of the consumer experience of notary is what most people think about. Actually, the driver for us have been our large corporates that already have notaries in their business, but they are stuck in a situation where they can't do it very efficiently in a remote environment.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">So, we already have an electronic notary capability, where we can actually do it without the paper. But people had to be present, in where their laws are from those states and where could be sitting, which is a little bit better doing it online. But people don't really mind to understand, I guess, that much.</p>
<p class="p p7">But now we have a situation where we can actually say, you can do it remotely what we're building, a combination of the collaboration tools Liveoak and our electronic notary to come to a true remote online notary. The demo is in place already. It looks like a beta starts in a couple of months.</p>
<p class="p p7">We've already got multiple customers that are existing, DocuSign, in some cases, is why Liveoak customers signed up. So this is a phenomenon. We're like a large bank that might say, yes, come to our branch to open an investment account. And they're saying it's not very competitive.</p>
<p class="p p7">It's not certainly, not a branch technology -- its not branch technology we can bring to you. You can do it remotely. And it's really slipping; you can open an account in a few minutes. And it's a trip into the location.</p>
<p class="p p7">And then the second phase to that -- by the way, that's called first-party notary or the institution has their own notary or take just some easy taking through those steps and you to require signature and witnessing in all those components. Now we'll do that online.</p>
<p class="p p7">And then the second piece will be to go after the third-party notary, which is that consumer experience. So many people have told us, particularly in the real estate base where if it as on [Indiscernible] ad money, last quarter that you was saying, I just bought this house. It was so great for DocuSign for the signature. And it's great. But then, it's varying in a notary on it.</p>
<p class="p p7">And to come to our house and put on the mask and it's -- because it's got to be a way you guys could take this on, so, jumping within that. Because you said that, we bought the Liveoak. And we're going to actually take care of that problem for you. And that'll be the second phase, sort of later into next year. We'll then move to go after that opportunity to provide for people a third-party notary.</p>
<p class="p p7">So you and I just whatever reason decides to do an agreement. And we said, we needed a notary and we would normally call someone or go to a FedEx or Kinco's, kind of solution. We can actually do it all online. And we'll be hopefully a good economic opportunity for the notaries out there, to have a much more efficient way to do their business versus driving around and travelling around. So that's the plan. We're excited.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Brent Thill</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Great. Well, thanks, Dan, for sharing the story. And best of luck. And appreciating you being part of the Jefferies conference. Thank you so much.</p>
