<p class="p p1"><strong>Company Participants</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Brice Hill – Chief Financial Officer</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Conference Call Participants</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning, and good afternoon, everybody. I’m Ross Seymore, the semiconductor analyst here at Deutsche Bank. We’re ready to get started with our next fireside chat. We’re thrilled to have Brice Hill, the CFO of Xilinx, on the virtual stage with me here. So welcome, Brice.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning, Ross. Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">So as we’ve done with these presentations before, if people have questions, just feel free to either pop it into the webcast system or email me directly at ross.seymore@db.com, and I’m happy to ask those questions. Otherwise, I will just be focusing on the fireside chat with Brice. So Brice, I’ve started off all of these meetings, especially with the broad-based companies like Xilinx, with some macro questions. But before I jump into those, I wanted to just dive into you joining Xilinx as the CFO. You came on in April, and things have been relatively crazy in 2020. So just talk about your decision to join Xilinx and how the first, I guess, upwards of six months has gone.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thanks, Ross. Well, it has been crazy with the weather situation on the West Coast, the pandemic, trade rule changes. There has been a lot of action. But focusing on the Xilinx decision, I was just super impressed with Victor and the management team and the vision of the company with the expectation that Moore’s Law will slow over time.</p>
<p class="p p1">Conceptually having an adaptable platform to bring together all of the different types of compute programming that’s needed in tomorrow’s environment really just captured my imagination. And I thought if Moore’s Law slows and we don’t have that beat rate for IP improvement on platforms every single year, wouldn’t it be great if compute platforms were programmable so that if there’s improvements needed, you could upgrade the platform without having to spin an entire chip? And just for that reason, I think the addressable market for the company will continue to grow. And I just liked what I saw in the company and its leadership team. So that attracted me.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Well, congratulations on that move, indeed. So let’s go in a little bit to the macro side of things. What’s been the impact of the COVID pandemic on your business? And why don’t we start on the supply side of the equation? Any limitations, shutdowns, lack of ability to supply demand that you’re now catching up on? Any sort of supply updates that you can provide would be helpful.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Right. Nothing really to point to from a disruption perspective on the supply chain. We did have a little bit of tightness in substrates, which we’ve worked through. Otherwise, we’re operating – most of our products have normal lead times. We’re operating with a reasonable amount of buffer inventory, and we’re able to serve everything we need to serve from a revenue perspective. So we haven’t been limited and really nothing specific to point to. And in the office and at work, we’ve – we’re really pleased with the company’s response.</p>
<p class="p p1">The employees have been great at adapting to this environment. And all of our programs are on track. We’ve got four products taping out on 16 and 7-nanometer at the back half of this year. And we’ve been able to stay on track with our engineering programs and keep everybody safe in the office. I’ve been in the office. We’re doing a good job of that. So we’re just – we’ve adapted well and really see no disruptions at this point. We hope it doesn’t keep – last for very long, but we’re happy with our response so far.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">That’s great to hear. Most of the companies, I would pivot right into the U.S. trade war issues, but I think I want to answer – or ask those questions as we dive into your segments, into the WWG side of things. So before I go there, I wanted to focus on some of the strategic areas where it appears that Xilinx is somewhat changing the focus over the last few years. Historically, of course, you’ve been a great leader in the FPGA side of things. Significant early growth in product cycles follows that. But a lot of times, FPGAs will play their role there. At times, they take a lot of power. They’re expensive.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">And so as the market grows, people move to standard products or ASICs. And that’s somewhat the normal cadence over the many years, and you guys have a great business model despite that cadence. The change that I think is interesting is Xilinx addressing that ASSP or SoC side itself. Zynq is probably the family that gets the most attention. But talk about the strategic pivot at the company to focus on that follow-on product that used to cannibalize the FPGA with an external competitor, now you guys doing it yourselves.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. Thanks, Ross. I think you hit the nail on the head with a pivot. This concept of an adaptable SoC, where we – Xilinx brings forth the major elements of a compute platform with all the interfaces and specialized components for different end markets like RF and analog components for the wireless or radar markets and real-time video and real-time compute components and high-speed output for more traditional markets.</p>
<p class="p p2">Bringing the elements of compute, graphics, compute, processing, real-time compute, the adaptable fabric that we have, bringing those to market all in one system allows Xilinx to address a much larger market size than we have in the past. And so that’s expanding the business and growing our TAM. And you’ve seen the revenue increase over the past few years, while Victor has been CEO, and we expect that to continue as we address fast-growing markets.</p>
<p class="p p2">The second piece that I would point to and more specific to your question on ASICs. As we build out our platforms, we’ll be able to build derivatives on those platforms that are cost and power optimized for certain elements of the platform. And we believe that, that will really provide best-of-both-world solutions for a customer that might be considering an ASIC. They’ll get the lower cost, lower power and density of shrink, shrinking that logic on a platform but yet still have the programmability on the platform.</p>
<p class="p p2">So if they’re not certain that they’re going to be able to put something in hardware that will last multiple years because their compute might change or the standards might change, then the programmability gives them the future-proofing and other benefits that our platforms offer. So it’s a combination of the strategy pivot to adaptable SoCs with all of the elements of compute, plus we will be customizing and optimizing derivatives of those platforms for the end markets that will compete much more strongly with ASICs while still offering the advantages of our platform. So it is a big pivot. And we think you’ll see in our TAM as it grows and our revenue growth over time that it’s going to look a lot different than the traditional FPGA business did.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">And I think just to put the perspective for some people, the Zynq product has ramped up to almost, by my math, 25% of the company’s revenues, I think, in the last fiscal year. So $750 million business, I think even if you analyze the best quarter, almost $800 million annual business. So that is a big success in any way, shape or form. If I take the financial aspects, Brice, of pivoting to this market, and whether it’s the Zynq products, the RFSoC, Versal ACAP – and I’m sure there’s a range of margins for those. But the business model implications from a profitability perspective, how does that factor in versus the traditional FPGA side? If you do more of these SoCs, is that good, bad or indifferent to the profitability of the company?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">We think it’s relatively indifferent. We don’t have a significantly different margin model outlook for the company. There are some businesses where we’ll consider platforms like our Alveo platform at higher levels of integration, where the margin structure might be a little different, especially at initiation. But our perspective on the market and the service of our end markets doesn’t change very much with the different platforms, RFSoC, MPSoC and Versal. We think the quality level, the programming model, the software tools that we provide, the flexibility that the platform provides, those are all strong selling features that will allow us to continue to pay for our R&amp;D and continue to provide good margins for the business.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">That’s great to hear. I think that’s definitely a hidden gem within the company. You guys talk about it with your growth aspirations. But I think under the covers, just seeing what the Zynq side alone has done should give people some confidence about what the other families of SoCs can do. So I look forward to monitoring that going forward. So Brice, why don’t we pivot over to the operating segments of the company and go into the WWG side of things first, the Wired and Wireless Group?</p>
<p class="p p3">This segment overall has been very, very volatile in the last couple of years. I think that in its peak quarter, it grew about 75% year-over-year, and that was March of last year. And I think it’s fallen nearly 50% year-over-year in its trough quarter, maybe not coincidentally in the March quarter of 2020. So talk a little bit about what’s driving that volatility. Is it specifically or majority of it on the wireless side? Or is there some dynamic going on in the wired side as well?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">No. I think it’s, Ross, mostly on the wireless side. What we saw – what happened in the world was there was an acceleration of 5G, especially with Korea and the Olympics. And the standards weren’t set and really, customers needed FPGAs to get those systems to market. And so we knew that we had some baseband designs and some system designs where once the networks were ready to deploy, they would likely be swapped out for more permanent solutions. So we did see an acceleration, and that dropped off after that initial burst of pull in for 5G in general.</p>
<p class="p p3">But going forward, our focus – we talked about our RFSoC, which is specialized for 5G and 4G build-outs. It has integrated analog and digital converters. It has integrated capabilities that are specific to optimizing RF. And you’ll see that we’ll ramp that product with customers. We’ve talked about a Tier 1 ramp at the end of this year in North America. We’ve talked about Samsung using the Versal platform for beam forming. And so as we go forward and the radios are built out for the 5G networks, that’s really where we’ll see the volume for Xilinx. If you think about the business model there, we’ll have more base stations because 5G is more dense than prior generations.</p>
<p class="p p3">Each base station might have 3 to 5 radios and each radio have 32 to 64 in antenna. And our chips are designed to serve 8 antenna. So you’re going to have 4 or 8 chips per radio. That kind of gives you a perspective on how that builds out as the density and the deployments occur. So as 5G grows over time, we think really in the radio side of the business, we’ll see volume for Xilinx, and we’ll see our RFSoC and our Versal platforms begin to gain share.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So the volatility we’ve had in the past, you described it as pull-in. I think on your last – which the 5G ramp was faster than anybody thought. So it wasn’t just your products that got pulled in. The other thing you mentioned on the last earnings call was that the ASIC transition was largely behind you already. And I know that’s mainly for the baseband side of the base station. Talk a little bit about that. Is this the new base? So the pull-in is behind you now, the ASIC transition is behind you now, and looking forward, you kind of can grow off the current base you’re at? Or is there still some transitions going on within that FPGA to ASIC dynamic at different customers as it rotates around the world?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Right. We were definitely referring to those baseband wins that were early on in the pulled-in deployments, and we knew that they would likely transition away. And we think that, that’s mostly completed. Going forward, the way we think about it is there’s multiple generations of 5G as the performance improves and there’s cost improvements with each of the equipment vendors. And so we’ll need to compete for each socket with other silicon providers, including ASICs in the second generation and third generation.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">But our perspective, Ross, is back on those dynamics that I described. We think we’ve got the key capabilities on the platform and the ability to optimize the platform from a performance and power perspective as well as have the integrated analog capabilities. We think we’ve got the best products for those platforms. And we expect to win our share of the business as 5G ramps on those different generations of product.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So is it fair to say that the ability of bringing SoC technology, whether it’s RFSoC, the MPSoC or in this case, the Versal ACAP side of things, should lengthen the duration of the tailwinds that the 5G generation can provide for Xilinx versus the historical model where you would have been much more FPGA dominant, independent?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">That’s right. And let me emphasize that point that we talked about in one of the prior questions is we will also do derivatives, build derivatives of our products for certain end – for certain equipment providers and customers. In other words, optimizing the cost and power of those components for specific deployments. And we think, yes, that will make us much more protected against replacement by basically offering the best of both worlds, where you’ll have hardened features at lower power and higher performance while still having the future-proof and optimization that the Xilinx products offer.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So two final questions on the wireless side of things, very much unrelated to one another, but just to wrap up the SoC side of it. You mentioned all of the integration that you have in the RFSoC. The analog side, you mentioned and I think you even said the word converters. Any sort of update on your ability to ship those products? I know you’re in the midst of a lawsuit. And so your comments are probably somewhat limited with Analog Devices, who used to be a partner of yours. But now it seems like you’re integrating some of the technology that they used to provide. How should investors consider that dynamic when they’re judging the growth opportunities of the RFSoC?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Right. No limitation on our ability to ship those products. Maybe we can talk about trade a little bit in another question. But from a legal perspective, no limitation on Xilinx. And we – I’m not going to comment specifically on that particular legal issue, but right, you shouldn’t have any perspective that there’s limitations on Xilinx.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it. And then yes, the last question was on the trade war side of things and the U.S. entity list. Can you just give us an update on the most recent data you’ve given about the exposure you have to customers who are on the entity list? And the most recent version of that, that I think kicks off this week, what sort of impact that may or may not have on Xilinx? And then maybe the final part, just so you can answer it all at once, the ability to get a license? Are you optimistic, pessimistic? Or doesn’t that really matter given what you’re focusing on?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Right. So yes, new rules went into effect yesterday, to your point, just to keep us all on our toes. So the new rules – let me start maybe more than a year ago. Before Huawei was put on the entity list, Huawei was a large customer of Xilinx. I think it had been reported as 6% to 8% type revenue customer for Xilinx. Once the entity list was there, Huawei became a much smaller customer for Xilinx. We – depending on the quarter, we said single-digit or low tens of millions of dollars. And that’s where it’s been operating recently, where we could still ship products that didn’t require a license but had been much lower than it was prior.</p>
<p class="p p4">Starting yesterday with the latest set of rules, almost all products going to Huawei will require a license going forward. And so what had been a small customer, again, low tens of millions or single-digit millions will eventually go to zero, pending Xilinx supplying for licenses. So we’re trying to resolve the situation with the government. We had been shipping products for all this year that we’re okay with the government.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">So we’re going to have them look at those again and see if we can get licenses, and that will be our medium-term plan. And what I would point to, Ross, longer term is if it’s unsuccessful and we don’t get licenses, then you have to expect that the compute demand for Huawei and for China will shift somewhere else. And we think we’re well positioned from that perspective with other vendors, our footprint with other vendors and our designs with other vendors to pick up that demand if it ships elsewhere. So that’s our strategy. Always a friction when you remove a customer, but we think we’re well positioned to pick up that demand, and we’ll work on the licenses.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Got it. Thanks for all that color. And I know it’s a moving target. It is difficult to predict, to put it mildly. So the last question on the WWG group is on the wired side of the equation. It doesn’t get a ton of attention. It’s the smaller portion in most quarters given the volatility on the wireless side. But just talk about your aspirations there. I think it’s probably about 30%, 40% of that segment, depending upon the quarter. What’s driving the growth or lack thereof in that segment?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, we do think it will be a growth business for us. We do think there’s focus on networks and building out the network capability, improving performance. So what’s called front-haul capability and packet convergence in the networks. Those are technologies where Xilinx products are fundamental to some of our key customers and how they deploy their networks. The thing I would point to, though, Ross, that’s sort of emerging for us is the security element of those networks.</p>
<p class="p p5">And what – we’ve got some of our traditional customers that are deploying security features that are new and emerging and require sort of real-time intense workloads, and our products are well suited for that. It has to be the ultimate in low latency and fast performance. And so our products are good for that. And that’s an emerging driver for demand in addition to our traditional front haul and packet convergence demand. So all in all, we think that’s also growing. With work from home and with extra video and services downloaded on the Internet, we think the network will continue to grow for us.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Great to hear. Why don’t we pivot over to the AIT portion of the company? About 40% of sales, 45% in the last quarter, maybe even close to 50% in your most recent guidance. That business is growing substantially. I think in the last couple of quarters, it’s grown nicely year-over-year and most assuredly in your guidance. How much of that is just the lumpiness inherent, especially on the TME side of things versus kind of a secular growth rate in that segment?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So it’s a great question. First of all, I should say that with the product pivot that we’ve described, with the adaptable SoCs, we do see our TAM growing in these segments. And so we do forecast more growth than what might be typical in the traditional FPGA market. Let’s put it like that. So long-term, we think each of these markets will grow: aerospace and defense, industrial, scientific and medical, test, measurement, emulation, prototyping. All of those end markets are what we’re talking about in this AIT group. We think each one of those markets has a growth driver. And we think our new product platforms will be growing the TAM in each of those.</p>
<p class="p p5">And then speaking – so I’m kind of saying look at the longer term because, to your point, in any – in some of those end markets, it does get more bunched. For example, on the test and measurement side, when 5G comes out, you have a number of customers who are getting their first sets of 5G equipment that’s new and specialized for testing 5G. So that might drive an acceleration of orders at a particular point in time.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">And on the prototyping and emulation side of the business, those tend to work more with contracts and deliver products in bunches, if you will, to end customers. So there is – there definitely is some aggregation of order patterns underneath, but our view is, yes, don’t get caught up in the quarter-by-quarter. We do expect each of those end markets to grow. And we think it’s both because of our platforms, growing the TAM and because of the underneath growth and needs for higher compute performance in each of those markets.</p>
<p class="p p6">Medical – or medical being a great example, where there’s much more automated medical care, robotic surgical devices and those sorts of things that are driving new business and new TAM for us. So that’s a good example of how the platforms will address more market going forward.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Maybe the last question on that segment. Investor attention is much more so on the 5G side of things and the data center side of things. Those are kind of the bright, shiny objects we always like to look at for growth. But the company’s origins, its core, its cash flow generation seems to be highly dependent upon the AIT side and to a certain extent, the ABC segment as well. How do you, as the CFO, allocate – and I know working with Victor and everybody else as well, allocate the investments into the core businesses of the company rather than the kind of the sexier side, at least from an investor point of view?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. It’s a great question, Ross, to give investors some insight into the company. Our platforms are built really to address each of the end markets. So when you think about those MP, RFSoC, the Versal platform, the Zynq platform, our platforms are built to be – to build a strong base platform. And then we can have derivatives that address each of those end markets if they need to be specialized.</p>
<p class="p p6">So when you think about Xilinx, think about a central engineering team that produces a very flexible platform, onboards the right features and IP, if you will, for each of the end markets and optimizes the performance of that platform for the end markets and provides easy-to-use, accessible programming tools that also offer capability for each of those markets.</p>
<p class="p p6">So I don’t view it – back to the core of your question. I don’t see many places. Of course, we’d like to build more products and there’s always more to build, but I don’t see places where we’re really trading off one segment for another. Instead, we’re building a core capability that we think can address all of our end markets. And we’ve selected the end markets with data center and wireless, for example, that can leverage the platforms that we’re building. So the TAM that we’re adding, we think, is just adjacent to our capabilities from a platform perspective and doesn’t really create a strategic trade-off.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">That’s great to hear because I think – yes, forgetting the core would be a big mistake. And in my opinion, I don’t think it gets enough attention, not from you but from investors, that is. So a couple of last questions in the five to seven minutes we have left. The last segment I want to hit on, and then that will pivot a little bit into the M&amp;A strategy of the company is data center. Clearly, a huge opportunity but one that, from at least my perspective, organically has not grown as fast as many had hoped. In the last couple of years, it’s growing very nicely off of an admittedly small base, but you also have some acquisitions in there. So talk a little bit about the growth aspirations you have. What are some of the hurdles that Xilinx has to get over? And how does M&amp;A play a role in bolstering the growth potential in DCG?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Good. So first, let’s start with growth. We do think that data center will be our fastest-growing segment. And we’ve talked about how accelerators will be needed in storage, compute and networking. And so it’s really the ability to optimize the performance of data center and our products providing a fundamental role in lowering total cost of ownership and improving performance and improving power consumption, et cetera, for data centers. So it is a significant growth – or growth opportunity for us.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">On the learning or on the how – why is it taking time for us to build into the data center, what we figured out is it’s just – it’s a longer design cycle and it takes time to learn to sell to these customers. So if you think about the hyperscalers, it’s a multiple quarter engagement to work with the hyperscaler. We just received a significant new design with a Tier 1 hyperscaler for SmartNIC, and it took us many quarters working with that customer on how we’ll optimize the hardware and the software and make it adoptable for them in their data center.</p>
<p class="p p7">And this is something that will require silicon work and will be a couple of years out from a ramp perspective, but it gives you the idea of how deep that engagement has to be. And it took a while for Xilinx to understand that relative to the other markets that we were talking about in the prior question.</p>
<p class="p p7">So I just think there’s a learning cycle, but it doesn’t change our perspective that there’s a low amount of attach right now for accelerators to storage, networking and compute. And we expect that there’ll be a very significant attach, the highest maybe in storage, second highest in networking and third highest in compute. And we think Xilinx is well positioned as that design that I just highlighted that, we compete against everyone else in the ecosystem.</p>
<p class="p p7">We think we’re well positioned to win those designs. And we’ll work with those customers to optimize our product to deploy in their data center. So yes, Ross, it’s one of our greatest opportunities. And it just matches Xilinx’s capabilities of high performance, low latency, high throughput and also the ability to customize the design for the customers over time as they change their workloads or change their compute environment.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thanks for all the color in that. I think we have about four minutes left, so I’m going to go with the lightning round version of questions here. And if you give the similar short answers, that would work as well. So on the gross margin side of things, if either product mix, less FPGA, more SoCs or vice versa, or end market mix, more wireless, less AIT, if those dynamics happen, how does your gross margin move?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Sure. So our gross margin does move mostly – especially in the short-term, it does move by end markets. So we’ve talked about how wireless and automotive, as an example, are lower margin than aerospace and defense and some of our more mature, traditional FPGA markets. So that is the primary driver of margin movement for us over time is the balance of end market sales. There’s not much variation in price and cost in the short-term.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Got it. On the OpEx side of things, keeping with the margin theme. You mentioned earlier the transition again, FPGAs going to SoCs. You’re taping out four new products this year. You’re controlling OpEx pretty tightly this year and doing a really good job. But it seems like the cadence of keeping up with Moore’s Law on the FPGA side and even doing so on the SoC side takes some significant costs on tape-outs. How do we think about OpEx relative to revenue going forward – growth rates?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. Thanks for that question. We – the company has just – we talked about the strategic development of Versal and the adaptable SoC. We’ve just made significant investment on this platform, a new architecture, bringing artificial intelligence, machine learning capabilities onto the platform and introducing the Vitis software environment so that it’s accessible by many more developers across the ecosystem.</p>
<p class="p p7">So that’s a big lift, Ross. And we think now for the next few years, we’ll be able to build derivatives on that platform. We’ve used 7-nanometer as a long-lived node for the company. And we’ll specialize and customize our derivatives as we’ve talked about. And that will allow us – as we grow the TAM and grow our revenue line and have a little bit less intense spend by leveraging the investments that we’ve made, we’ll be able to get operating leverage over time with respect to spending intensity. So that is our internal forecast, and that’s how we expect it to play out.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Ross Seymore</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Then the final question, which is not given its true worth in only one minute. But how is Xilinx looking at the M&amp;A market? You’ve done a couple of smaller, what I would deem to be tuck-in deals in the data center side of things, but there’s obviously some mega-cap deals occurring right now. How does Xilinx play into that equation, especially with the great free cash flow generation you’ve always had?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Right. Well, thanks for saying that. Yes, we’re profitable. We’re profitable during the crisis. We’re adding earnings and cash to our balance sheet. So we have a system for evaluating opportunities. We’ve done well with our Solarflare and DeePhi acquisitions and others that we’ve done. So we feel like we have the capability and it is in our toolbox. So we constantly evaluate options. And we do expect, Ross, M&amp;A to play a role for us going forward. And we wouldn’t rule out – we don’t have a size limiter. We look at technology tuck-ins, but we’ll also look at things that might be more meaningful for us in the marketplace. So – and we won’t hesitate if we find something that will accelerate the strategy and competitive position and then accelerate – and make sense financially. So those are really our two criteria.</p>

<p class="p p8">Perfect. Well, thank you for keeping us on time with the lightning round, especially at the end. But Brice, congrats again on the CFO role, and especially in the most challenging time, we probably all could imagine. And thanks for attending the DB Tech conference this year. We appreciate your participation.</p>
