<p class="p p1"><strong>Matthew Harrison</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us for the next session. I’m Matthew Harrison, one of the biotech analysts here at Morgan Stanley. I’m pleased to have Sarepta here for our next session. I just need to read a quick disclaimer statement before we begin.</p>
<p class="p p1">Please note that this webcast is for Morgan Stanley clients and appropriate Morgan Stanley employees only. This webcast is not for members of the press.

<p class="p p1">With that, I’m going to turn it over to Doug Ingram, who’s the CEO of Sarepta. Doug’s going to make some opening comments. And then, we’ll jump into Q&amp;A.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Doug Ingram</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you very much. And thanks for having us here today, Matthew. This is Doug Ingram, the CEO of Sarepta. With me today as well is Ian Estepan who’s my Chief of Staff and our Head of Investor Relations as well.</p>
<p class="p p1">One thing, I should say before we begin, of course, very likely you’re going to ask me questions about the future. So, as it relates to the risks and uncertainties, forward-looking statements, people refer to our public filings to see all of the various risks that come with trying to predict the future. And if anybody wonders, whether it’s difficult to predict the future, I would ask people to consider how they thought about 2020 in January of this year versus now.</p>
<p class="p p1">I’ll be brief in my opening comments, because I’m sure there are a lot of questions. We’re getting a lot done this year.</p>
<p class="p p1">We started 2020 out with an enormous task ahead of us across both of our gene therapy platform as well as our RNA platform. And then, of course, the pandemic hit and we sent the vast majority of our employees, about 85% of our employees to work largely from home, starting in mid-March, as did the rest of the world, generally speaking. And one would have thought that that would have not as considerably outpacing, it hasn’t. I’m really proud to say that through a lot of great work on behalf of the team and our partners, we have stayed largely on a mission over the course of this year and hitting an enormous number of milestones.</p>
<p class="p p1">In the gene therapy side of the world, one of the big tasks for us, let’s start with limb-girdle, just as an example. We had a number of really interesting readouts, both in our low dose cohort and our higher dose cohort with limb-girdle, which is very exciting for us. That’s one of our five internal programs. We have a sixth one with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and that program is 2E. We dose -- the high dose version of that had very, very good results there, and we’re in actually GMP runs right now to get that material raised, so that we can after having some additional dialogue with the FDA, hopefully commence a trial that would be a pivotal trial next year for limb-girdle 2E.</p>
<p class="p p1">On staying with gene therapy, of course, on SRP-9001, our Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy, we have a lot to do over the course of this year, and we’ve had a lot go the right direction for us this year. The big issue for us was getting our manufacturing in order. We spent an enormous amount of time over the course of the last couple of years doing that. We started GMP runs tracking into this year. And I’m proud to say that we hit our milestone of having those GMP runs completed in July. So, that’s very well, from a manufacturing perspective going very well, as well from a milestone perspective and from a functional perspective we had, in I believe, June of this year, JAMA Neurology published the one year data on the first four boys that were treated in Study 101 and they continue to do very well both, functionally and from a safety perspective. And as you may have seen, we issued a press release recently, we’re going to update that with the two-year functional and other data for those boys coming up at World Muscle.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Our goal next of course, with that material steady track, Study 102 is about placebo-controlled, well controlled trial to show the efficacy and safety of our therapy. That is going well that we will have last patient, last visit this year and that’ll read out early next year. We also need to get kids starting to be dosed on the commercial process material that we’ve completed in July. That’s where we have dialogue going on with the FDA right now.</p>
<p class="p p2">We had a Type C meeting very recently with the FDA. As you know, our goal there was to get their blessing to allow us to commence our next trial. If you’ve not yet had that blessing, the primary issue there is with the potency assay. To the best of our knowledge, there’s no problem with the underlying material. Our own potency assay says that the material is comfortably within spec, but it’s really about the measures one would use to show that potency. So, we need to have additional dialogue with the agency, and I’m sure there’ll be questions around that today. But we’re working on that to resolve that. So, we can start that next trial as well, which is important for us.</p>
<p class="p p2">Then on the RNA side, you know, in addition to getting casimersen approved, last year, our third therapy, golodirsen, eteplirsen, our third therapy casimersen was accepted for filing by the agency middle of this year. So, if all goes well, we’ll have a third therapy approved at the beginning of next year. And we’ll have a readout later this year on our next generation RNA platform, which is our PPMO, where we use peptide conjugated version of our PMO to increase penetration. We’re already at the 20 mg/kg. We’re excited about the fact that we’re 20 mg/kg. We’re going to continue to dose up, 20 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, perhaps we can even get higher than that. And so we start seeing signals that tell us we’re at the right dose and that we actually have a dose limiting signal and that will tell us what our right dose is. But, we will be announcing the 20 mg/kg results in the second half of this year.</p>
<p class="p p2">With that, I’m dangerously close to being on a long monolog. So, I’ll stop. And Matthew, I’m sure you’ve got a lot of questions for us.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p2"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Q - Matthew Harrison</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Thanks, Doug. I appreciate the comments. And I think it’s a good place to start. So, why don’t we start with the news from last week with the Type C meeting feedback. I think, maybe the key thing for people to understand is, obviously, you need to go talk to the regulator and understand what specifically they want to see related to the potency assay. But, I guess, talk to us about the potency assay that you have right now. And then, what other assays you already have under development to additionally measure potency that you could provide to them?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Doug Ingram</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. I’m going to be careful to only -- and I apologize for this. I’ll frustrate you. I’m only going to speak in generic terms. I’m not going to speak in specificity, because I want to have conversations with the agency, and I don’t want to suggest that one particular assay or the other will be the appropriate one that they’ll agree to. Broadly speaking, a couple of things to understand about where we are. And there is some uncertainty about the process to get this resolved, simply because we have yet to have a direct dialogue with the agency on this issue. And that is not a typical of companies right now, dealing with CBER. CBER is already overwhelmed. They were overwhelmed before this dynamic by an enormous number of INDs in cell and gene therapy. The last time I checked, and this may be significantly out of date. I think, there were something like 900 INDs. So, the CBER -- and this particular division, OTAT, is already enormously burdened with INDs and a ton of work to do. And then, of course, COVID-19, this pandemic did not make, I’m sure, the world easier for them. So, we’ve only been able to get a written response. Our Type C meeting, while fashion of meeting was actually not a live meeting, it was simply a response to questions that we posed. So, we need to have more dialogue with the agency.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">We have a potency that at least from our perspective works very well. There are two things that you essentially have to prove with potency. The first, of course -- with respect to gene therapy, the first, of course, is that the vector gets to the right place consistently in the right way. And that when it gets there that the release gene, the construct does the -- it has no biological activity that is desired, in this case, from our perspective that of course is making micro-dystrophin that would act as a structural protein in these kids. And we believe -- at least we believe that our potency assay does a very elegant job of showing those issues.</p>
<p class="p p3">The agency in their written minutes doesn’t agree once they have a dialogue about that, it wants to consider perhaps the addition of one or another assay. We have at least three, I may be understating the number of potential assays that we could choose from there. And so really, this is a -- this is, from our perspective, at least more process, the uncertainty around the solution. We are very confident, as we stated today that with the dialogue with the agency, we will have a resolution with this issue and it will be behind us, and we’ll start dosing patients. But, the timeline depends on the process. And there really are -- there’s a panoply of choices. There’s obviously informal process where we could speak to them, we’d have a dialogue, understand and resolve this rapidly. There is a slightly more formal process, but still a relatively rapid process, which is a Type A meeting that is sort of on the outside, about a 60-day process. There is a formal dispute resolution process. Our goal is to avoid that, if at all possible. That’s more like a four-month process on sort of the far end of this issue. But, we’re working right now to resolve that issue and we’ll certainly provide an update as soon as we know.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. And in terms of -- let’s just assume for a second, you agree with the agency on another potency assay that they’d like you to use. How long does it take to validate that assay and then be able to actually use that assay to release GMP material?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Doug Ingram</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, depending on the assays, there are a number of assays we have that would take very little time to validate and get ready to use. They are already far -- we’re already far down the path on other assays in any event. So, that would not be a significant limiter to commencing the trial. The biggest rate limiter in commencing the trial is simply to come to a meeting of the minds and agreement with the agency and get their concurrence on more than the actual development of an assay. We have a number of assays that are very far along with the validation process would not take on.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Doug Ingram</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And just so you know, we’re working on that. We are not going to sit -- don’t imagine this as being a process that is sequential. It’s going to be concurrent. We’re working on that. We’re across those assays, even as we dialogue with the agency, so that we are not losing time waiting to have conversations with the agency.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay, got it. Helpful. And then, I think second thing, your press release mentions other issues or use the sort of generic term for other things. Can you maybe characterize the scope or scale of those other requests that you received?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Doug Ingram</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">We’ve asked a number of questions of the agency, both in terms of the protocol and the material itself, and they’ve made a number of comments to us. We can address those comments. Those are not, from our perspective, the rate limiters. The rate limiting issue for us is the potency assay. That really is the significant issue that has to be resolved as a predicate to our commencement of our next trial.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. So, I guess -- and this one will be difficult to answer. And so, I guess, instead of maybe giving us an answer, maybe just walk us through, as you think about the various steps. But, people’s question will be, okay, you’re on track to give us data in the pivotal study in early 2021, but obviously, resolving this and having enough patients dosed and enough material is a key component to being able to file and then be able to provide the product. So, let’s assume for a second you are successful with the pivotal study. How do you think about the puts and takes of this timeline in terms of your ability to be in a position to file?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Doug Ingram</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Well, it really depends on the timeline to resolve this issue and to commence the next trial. But, it could be little to no significant -- little to no material delay to a delay of a few months. That’s the sort of the boundaries I think right now.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. Perfect.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Doug Ingram</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">The answer to that depends on a discussion with the agency. So we don’t know yet.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. Okay. Can we talk a little bit about data that you have so far? And I guess, the questions that I always get on the pivotal study, I guess first, you’re going to give us two-year data you’ve talked about at World Muscle in terms of follow-up. I think, the question that most people would ask is, given that data and given the way you know about how you’ve powered this study, what does that data tell you or help you in your confidence around being able to have a successful readout?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Doug Ingram</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I don’t want to step on the two-year data. I’ll let that speak for itself, when it comes out. I think, my team would be really unhappy if I jumped the gun on that. But, let me say, all of the information that we have seen thus far in our trial continues to give us confidence that our original powering for Study 102 was appropriate. Remember, at the time that we powered 102, we had the benefit of our own -- we have a lot of natural history data and patient level and natural history data that informed our views. We put in -- we had the early reads on what we call Study 101, those kids that gave us some view on what this therapy might be able to do for these children and children have been in this age range, and then we were very careful about the design of the study. As you may recall, we actually have balanced the kids in the four to five-year old range versus six to seven-year old range across the placebo arm and the active arm, which has helped -- which we believe will help, I should say, it’s a blinded trial, will help reduce standard deviation. We put in ceiling and floors to reduce standard deviation. And so, at least from our perspective, and of course, as all the -- it will all be proven right or wrong when we review the data and when we unblind it in early 2021. But, our perspective, as we’re standing here right now is that we feel very good about the powering of this trial. But, the trial at the time that we went to 40 patients, it’s actually 41 now, was over 90% -- significantly over 90% power. So, we feel good about where we are with the trial.</p>
<p class="p p4">And we feel great about the execution of the trial. And one of the -- probably there are a number of risks we took with COVID-19. The first risk one would worry about is the manufacturing itself. The good news is we have made so much progress before COVID-19 hit us. But, that has not slowed us down from a manufacturing perspective and release perspective. That’s fantastic. Second one of course is Study 102. The great news is that those kids have all been dosed before COVID. The main part of the trial, all have been dosed before COVID-19 hit. And we’ve been able to manage through those issues with Nationwide Children’s Hospital and UCLA, so that we’re in a good place right now. And that study will have last patient, last visit in December, and we’ll have a readout in early 2021. So, we’re in good shape there. We feel good about it. We feel good about the power.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay, helpful. And then, I guess, second thing is, some people have looked at -- and I’m sure you’ve gotten this question, some people have looked at the various genotypes of the patients from the Phase 1 study and suggested that some of those patients had more favorable genotypes than others and try to, I guess, look at those and make a conclusion about what it might have been if you had different genotypes. I mean, any thoughts on how much of a driver of those genotypes really are in terms of outcomes? And do you have any concerns about favorable or non-favorable genotypes among the Phase 1 population as a good surrogate?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Doug Ingram</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">I think, whoever is saying that is dead wrong. I mean, I think we have an exon 51 child, I believe, in Study 101. Ian will speak up if I misstating things. But, these are very -- these are among the most serious genotypes in study. The two significant genotypes that result in a milder phenotype, which are not present in Study 101, of course, exon 44 amenable kids. And exon 8 amenable kids have 1 through 7 dilution. They’re not in there. And they won’t be in our Study 102 either. So, I think that is a false thesis?</p>
<p class="p p5">Look, it’s four kids. Let me just say, we do have to be -- we have to follow the science. It’s -- one might argue, it’s only four kids, and it’s open label. And 102 is going to tell us a lot. It’s a well controlled, blinded study with 41 kids. With that said, I think those first 4 kids who suffer from Duchenne muscular dystrophy and do not fall into a mild phenotype for Duchenne muscular dystrophy appear on the face of it to act functionally distinctively different than one would have anticipated in age-matched kids and their trajectory. And so, we’re very excited about that. When you couple that with the expression, which would have predicted this -- the functional benefit, and of course, the safety, we feel very good going into the readout on Study 102 variable.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay, perfect. So one more question, then I’d like to move on to limb-girdle. But, I think, one of the other things was you talked about manufacturing and your scaling there. Do you remain on track to be able to have thousands of doses available when you launch? Maybe you can just update us on your potential supply around the time of launch?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Doug Ingram</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. We feel great about supply right now. This was the big issue -- probably our biggest issue last year was getting our process in place, getting our yields in place, getting the units in place, so that we had the capacity. We needed all of that. We needed suites, we needed the units, we needed them installed, we needed them up and running, then we needed -- more important even than that, we needed the process right, so that we were getting the right kind of yields. And the short answer is that we’re in great shape by them from a capacity perspective. We should be, by the time we’re launching this therapy, in a place where we should be able to -- in the United States and in the initial countries around the world, we should be able to fully serve the community.</p>
<p class="p p5">Now, there will be a day that will come in the next couple of years where as we think about expanding into other large areas with our partner, Roche, places like China that we’re going to have to think about additional capacity. But that -- that’s the modular, easier part of this. The hard part of it is getting the process development and analytical development, right. And I’m very pleased to say we’re in a good place with that right now. So, we feel very good about it. I mean, we were -- as you may recall, I mean, this was the question of 2019, and we were like, we’re going to get there. We feel good about where we’re going. We know what’s possible. It’s just going to take us more experience and more turns and more process development to get to that place. But, the great news is, as we sit right now, is we feel very good about our process development, we feel very good about the yields that we’re getting. And we always hope to get even more and more better for cost of goods and the like. But, we feel very good about it from a supply perspective and certainly a community perspective and the like. And the cost of goods are acceptable, et cetera. And we feel great from an assay development work. Now, we just need to sit with the agency. We need to get their concurrence. We need to adapt our thinking to what they want. And that’s going to be our biggest goal here, and then get our next commercial process trial going. Our goal is to try and do that as soon as possible.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay, good. Helpful. So, limb-girdle, I think two things maybe there. You obviously earlier in the year had data on high dose patients. Maybe speak broadly to what that gives you in terms of your view on safety margin across the platforms. And then, second, just talk about from a pivotal study standpoint, what needs to be done there.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Doug Ingram</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. So, we’re really excited. Just to remind everybody, and this is what we’ve done. With limb-girdle 2E, limb-girdle 2E is beta-sarcoglycan. It’s a missing structural protein, very similar to dystrophin with one significant exception, which is that beta-sarcoglycan is the actual native protein that you don’t have to edit it because the beta-sarcoglycan gene is sufficiently small that it comfortably packages an AAV. So, we did a lower dose version. So, it was a quarter of the dose that we used with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and we had those results out earlier in the year. And what we saw is even at a quarter of the dose, we got great expression on immunohistochemistry. I think, we were 51% protein positive fibers. And I think I’m going to get these numbers slightly wrong, because these are off the top of my head. But, on western blot, I think we were in the mid-30s, maybe 36%, if I’m not mistake, on western blot. Ian, if I’m materially wrong, correct me. And so -- and it was safe and well tolerated from our perspective. So, it looks good.</p>
<p class="p p6">And then, we saw -- by the way, we also updated recently on the one year data on those kids. And even at the lower dose, they look significantly better than that natural history would have said. Now, I will suggest that natural history is not as built out with 2E, it is an ultra-rare disease, versus Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but the kids looks brilliant compared to what we had in natural history. Two of these kids are 14 years old now, natural history would have suggested they’ll be in fairly deep decline. One of those two 14-year olds actually maxed the NSA, the limb-girdle version of NSA, maxed it out. So, at least that kid, nobody on this call will do better than that kid at that time point on an SAP. So, we feel great about that.</p>
<p class="p p6">But then, we did the next thing, which is we dosed up. And we dosed at the same dose as Duchenne muscular dystrophy as SRP-9001, which using our super coil method would have been 2 times the 14th. And the great news is, we saw a significant increase in expression and dose-dependent increase in expression. These kids are really approaching normal. They’re over 70%, I believe on I think immunohistochemistry. So, significant increase in expression. Expression is of the native protein, so approaching normal on the native protein, safe and well-tolerated, generally speaking. We actually changed the steroid protocol for those kids in a similar way that we’re changing it for 102, and we did see elevated liver enzymes with those kids. So generally speaking, it looks really good. And we’re excited about that. We’re excited about what we’ll see there.</p>
<p class="p p6">So, now, the question is, how do we get to a pivotal trial? Okay? And our view is we need to get into a pivotal trial with this limb-girdle and the other limb-girdles as fast as possible. This is an ultra-rare disease, like so many of the limb-girdles we’re working on, we’re able to -- it’s a structural protein, it’s the absence of a structural protein. We’re able to restore that structural protein in its native form and at really significant amounts. And so, we -- number one, we need to get GMP material out. We have GMP material runs going on right now. The big issue right now is just the assay development. You get the assay development done, we’ll have that done by the end of this year. We need to have dialogue with the agency, as you’ve heard earlier. It’s difficult to have informal dialogue with the agency, but we need to have some dialogue with the agency, get the agency’s view on what the path forward would be. We’re not shy about saying that our hope at least, and I’m not suggesting for a second that we’d get this yet, but our hope is that you could do something like an accelerated approval pathway for these ultra-rare diseases and structural proteins, based on the biomarker, which is the actual protein that’s missing. And so, we’ll know that by early next year. And that will inform not only 2E, but the rest of our limb-girdle programs.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">And then, the second thing I would say about this high-dose cohort for limb-girdle 2E is that not only has read-through to other limb-girdles, it has read-through to DMD, of course. It’s the same vector, rh74 that’s used in both. It’s the same dose, it’s the same promoter. So, there’s so much similar between these two that’s seeing expression in safety and limb-girdle at much bigger kids, these kids are over 50 kilograms, gives us a lot of confidence about what we’ve already seen with DMD.</p>
<p class="p p7">And one of the things that’s important and one of the things that you should be demanding, I think patients and physicians and perhaps investors as well, of companies like us is that we talk to you about the genome copies per nucleus that we’re getting so you can see that we are actually able to insert to vector in a higher level. With DMD at 2 times the 14th, we were at 3.3 genome copies per nucleus. And lo and behold, we did the limb-girdle 2E high dose. We’re at 4.2 genome copies per nucleus. So, rh74 is working very well, both from a safety perspective, from a tropism perspective, it’s really been impressive, to say the least, and then the ability to release that cargo and then the kind of expression that we’re getting post genome copy being at the right place has been impressive.</p>
<p class="p p7">So I think, overall, the data continues to break our -- in favor of the thesis that we’ve had around the way we build these constructs and the use of rh74, particularly for these limb-girdle muscular indications. Manufacturers going brilliantly right now, and now we just have to the point where we can release this material and start our next trial with the blessing of the FDA. And we’ve got some work to do to get that done hopefully in the next few months.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Matthew Harrison</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, perfect. And then, I guess, just one follow-up. Let’s assume that you come to a conclusion around the potency assay and release criteria for the material for DMD. Does that have read-through then to limb-girdle, or are you going to have to have a similar discussion around limb-girdle?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Doug Ingram</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">We’ll have to have a separate discussion about limb-girdle, but it will inform the discussion with limb-girdle enormously. I mean, whatever we decide with the agency for the potency assay approach for DMD will certainly be -- will certainly inform our views. So it will accelerate our views in so many ways. Because with respect to gene therapy and the newness of gene therapy, everything we do, the first time we’re plowing a new field and where every step forward is a brand new step. Things coming behind it, we’ll benefit from it. We’ll move faster. I can tell you -- I don’t remember the exact number. I’m not going to say it because I’ll probably get it wrong, but the length of time that it took us, as an example, to do the process development for DMD was cut significantly when we got to limb-girdle 2E. That ability to kind of move faster and faster from a platform perspective is going to be the thing that’s going to make this a really significant engine. Same answer is going to apply to assay. So, in the first instance, one of the first things we need to do with the FDA is really talk to them and figure out exactly what they want from an assay. That will be enormously enlightening for us. And we’ll completely apply it to 2E, and then we’ll apply it to the other limb-girdle. And then, we’ll apply it to the other limb-girdles and then we’ll apply it to the rest of the pipeline behind it. We’ve got about 27 gene therapy programs between development and research right now, all of which will benefit from these first discussions.</p>

<p class="p p7">Okay, perfect. So, maybe just to finish this up. PPMO, just help set reasonable expectations around what people should expect. Obviously, I think you talked about talking about expression, but we’re not going to get dystrophin data. So, maybe just walk through what the data is we’re going to get and why we’re going to get that and not dystrophin data?</p>

<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Doug Ingram</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Sure. A couple of things about it. Just to remind everyone of what we’re going to -- what the goal of this multi-ascending dose trial is. So, again, I’ll just step back for just a second. Apologies, I have to do this. But the PPMO in many ways is just an elegant therapy that benefits children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It is precise. It does what it’s supposed to do when it gets to the right place, creating -- being something that’s really would have been science fiction some years ago, editing messenger RNA, putting it back in frame and creating truncated but functional dystrophin. In that regard, it’s brilliant. And it’s got a very laudable safety profile. It has a limitation. There’s a reason why our PMOs create phenotypic change, but are limited in how much phenotypic change they can and how transformative they can be. And that of course is because they’re neutrally charged, so they can only passively get into the cell. And so, it limits the amount of construct into the cell and it limits the amount of exon skipping and therefore, ultimately the amount of dystrophin production. So, we are looking for avenues to fix that one issue to solve that to make the PMOs even more transformative. And that’s the PPMO, which is the peptide conjugated PMO, positively charged peptide that in animal models works brilliantly, gets into -- just mechanically drags the PMO across the cell membrane in much greater abundancy.</p>
<p class="p p8">The biggest issue for us, frankly, at this stage, more than dystrophin, et cetera, is can we get to right dosing. Now, we tried this before significantly. Some years ago, we tried this with a very different peptide and it did exactly what it was supposed to do. In animal models, it significantly increased penetration. It dragged the PMO in, but it did that unsafely. There was a significant renal issue. In fact, it rapidly ended the study because the animals had enormous renal problems associated with the peptide. So, the question then posed was -- the fundamental question isn’t mechanically, it’s not the mechanism of action. It’s can you dose it? We completely change the peptide through a whole process of high throughput screening and ripping it apart and testing. I think, we’ve come to the answer on a peptide that can do that without seeing a renal signal. So, for us at least, the biggest issue for us is, can we get to high doses without seeing a significant retinal signal, and how high can we go? Based on allometric dosing and the like, we had envisioned that we would need to get to about 12 mg/kg to really get excited about this therapy. We’re already at 20 mg/kg and that’s what you’re going to see. And it looks like we’ll be able to continue to dose through that to 30 mg/kg and perhaps, perhaps, we don’t know yet, even 40 mg/kg. So, what we’re going to see later this year is our 20 mg/kg dose. The reason that we’re not going to see dystrophin production, but we’re going to see exon skipping is Dystrophin takes a long time to build. I mean, we’ve seen -- in the PMO, we see it at one year and it actually builds from one year to four years. So it is through constant tissue exposure. It just builds over a long period of time. This is, I believe, 12-week data. So, it is really too early to be looking for dystrophin production. But, we can see exon skipping. So we can at least see the signal of what we would see if the tissue exposure looks good, if the safety looks good, if the dose looks good, we should be able to see a delta in exon skipping, and that’s our goal here. So that’s the reason between those two. We’re really very excited about this.</p>
<p class="p p8">Now, again, we don’t have the data, and we’ll see the data in the second half of this year. But, I think if they’re -- if the opportunity to dose at 20 mg/kg and maybe even dose higher than 20 mg/kg up to 30 and 40 exists, we feel very confident about the mechanism of action. And so long as the safety looks good, there is a real possibility this is a transformative therapy over the PMOs. And if that’s the case, it could be exciting, not only in DMD, but beyond DMD.</p>
