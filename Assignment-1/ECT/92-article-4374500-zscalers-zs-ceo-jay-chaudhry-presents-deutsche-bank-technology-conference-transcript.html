<p class="p p1">Patrick Colville – Deutsche Bank</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Patrick Colville</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Hello, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today for this call with Zscaler. I am Patrick Colville, a senior analyst at DB, covering the cybersecurity and the infrastructure software space. The format of this session will be a presentation followed by a listener Q&amp;A. There’s a chat box where you the audience can ask questions. The questions are anonymous, so we’re not going to mention your company name or affiliation. So I guess let’s kick this off introductions.</p>
<p class="p p1">So we’ve got Jay Chaudhry, CEO of Zscaler; and CFO, Remo Canessa, with us. Zscaler, as the audience will know, is a pioneer in cloud-based network security or a space also known as in a SASE by Gartner. And so I guess Jay, Remo, thank you so much for joining us. The floor is yours.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Jay Chaudhry</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">All right. Patrick, thank you. This is Jay Chaudhry. I’ll take about 5 minutes or so to set the stage. If you are looking at the slide, my first slide talks about our architecture. We were not designed to do network security with a castle-and-moat model. We’re designed for the world of cloud where applications are anywhere, users are anywhere, so you can’t do network security. And we don’t do network security. We securely connect a user to application or an application to application, over any network, so because Internet is becoming the new Network, and Cloud is becoming the data center.</p>
<p class="p p1">So with that, if you move on to the next slide. And if you – so number one, this whole digital transformation happens in three steps: One is, application transformation, when your applications move to cloud or SaaS; two, if that happens, your network must change. It’s no longer good to have this hub-and-spoke network. You need to go direct, just like you’re doing when you work from home; three, if you do that, your security breaks, because it’s sitting in the data center, protecting your data center network. Your branch network, it’s meaningless. So you need a security transformation, whereby, we sit as a zero trust exchange or in a layman’s terminology, as a very smart switchboard. So user connects to us.</p>
<p class="p p1">If you really see, this is Slide number 3, I’m showing. You go to external applications, ZIA. You do external applications with ZPA. So user can work on anywhere on any device. So we are not just a security company. With a foundation of your application, network and security transformation, very different than traditional companies. Built four solutions on top of it: user to Internet; user to private apps; user to app experience; and user app-to-app. You are familiar with ZIA or Zscaler Internet Access. This is the product that is designed for secure web gateway and evolved beyond that. And Zscaler Private Access, it starts to replacing VPN, but it’s a lot more than that. It is about securely accessing the application with zero trust. And user experience was a natural thing for us to do, because we’re sitting between the user and the application to let the customer know where the bottlenecks are and why.</p>
<p class="p p1">An app-to-app is a new nascent, young market. We are taking our core technology of zero trust as a switchboard to really control which app can talk to which app, without trying to do old school network segmentation. All this built on a purpose-built platform, not some kind of old technology and we’re not cobbling together things. This platform helps us simplify, consolidate a bunch of own products and reduce IT costs.</p>
<p class="p p1">So in the Zscaler world, we work together five key areas. We’re sitting in line as the Zero Trust Exchange. We securely connect applications and users. Identify our friendly partners, endpoint management, our partners. We integrate with SD-WAN vendors, so they can send traffic to us to secure SD-WAN. We can feed logs to security operations. And we integrated all leading cloud providers and SaaS vendors. Our logos here are example logos. We integrate with all leading vendors in these areas.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">The last point I’ll make here is, Zscaler architecture is went for the cloud. It is any-to-any connective, the old school architecture, whether it is from proxy vendors like Blue Coat, semantics of McAfee or the world audits firewall company, they all tried to do network security. These are two opposing architecture. It’s not a matter of adding a feature. It’s a matter of doing the right architecture. We think the only way the legacy will catch up with us, if they start with a clean slate and try to build something like a multitenant cloud-native we have built, which is not a trivial task.</p>
<p class="p p2">So with that, Patrick, over to you.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p2"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Q - Patrick Colville</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Thank you, Jay, for that. Really appreciate you taking the time. I guess the elephant in the room right now for every business is COVID. So I think many investors will understand that cybersecurity risks in the enterprise are increasing. But how – what are you seeing as Zscalers, the effect of COVID on cybersecurity risks and, I guess, your business?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Jay Chaudhry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. So we handle about 130 billion requests going through us to the Internet every day. So we’re seeing a whole lot of things out there. And when the first two months of COVID between late March to April and early May, we saw about 0.5 million threats that are COVID related. People were trying to sell COVID masks, COVID test kits, all kind of trying to lure you and infect you. So the number of risks have gone up, not end somewhere. Attacks have gone up. That’s where – that’s why customers need us, because they can go direct with Zscaler, ZIA to the Internet, ZPA to internal applications, totally safe. And that’s driving a lot of interest in our areas. So threats aren’t slowing down with COVID, they are actually increasing.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Patrick Colville</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes, that’s very clear. I want to make this as interactive as possible. So any audience members have any questions, then please use the chat function, which is in your browser or alternatively, e-mail me on patrick.colville, which is Colville at db.com. So it’s patrick.colville@db.com or the chat function for any questions that are, it will be fully anonymous. So I guess, Jay, I mean, back to you. You briefly talked about ZPA. But can you just help us understand why it’s differentiated versus the likes of Prisma Access and VPN capabilities and another, I guess, remote application access tools that are out there?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Jay Chaudhry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. If you don’t do ZPA, the traditional vendors, whether it’s a firewall VPN company or it is traditional VPN company like Cisco AnyConnect. They connect user to a network while the user is sitting wherever and they put you on the network. That means, the user could be sitting in Moscow, but it acts like, he’s sitting in your [indiscernible] they can have access to all kind of hundreds of servers and applications sitting on the network. It’s a dangerous thing. If you guys are interested, you should read a story about how a ransomware attack on a mega-shipping company called Maersk, Maersk. And the one machine got infected and everything came – brought down. So it’s a most dangerous thing. In fact, our reason zero trust network access became popular was that once user got connected [Audio Dip] it does not connect users to the network. It connects only to the applications and none of those risks and spread, that’s number one.</p>
<p class="p p2">Number two ends up being the attack surface. You know, when you’ve got a VPN kind of box, the VPN kind of broadcasts the Internet, "I am here, if you want to connect with me, and I am here, if you want to attack me." So you can actually – if any bad guy can find all the VPN servers of every company out there and attack them [Audio Dip]</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Patrick Colville</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Jay, we might be having some connection problems. Remo, you still on?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Remo Canessa</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">I am.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Patrick Colville</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Should we – shall I jump to my next question with you and once Jay dials back in. My next question is going to be about ZPA adoption because it’s pretty clear in your numbers that COVID-19 and ZPA has been a pretty big tailwind for Zscaler? So can – I mean I’d love to understand from your perspective, how should we think about where we are in the adoption curve? And you gave guidance last week. And I guess what ZPA kind of contributes to that guidance for fiscal 2021?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Remo Canessa</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. So I mean, ZPA, over the last four years has increased from 4% of our new and upsell business to 10% to 14% and then to 29% this year. The adoption of ZPA, really excels…</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Jay Chaudhry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Hey guys, sorry. I’m back. I somehow I got kicked off. Sorry. This is Jay.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Remo Canessa</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Hey, Jay, I’m in the middle of a answer. Do you want to start or do you want to go from here?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Jay Chaudhry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">No, no, carry on please, carry on. Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Remo Canessa</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. Yes. ZPA contributed 43% of our new and upsell business in Q3. And that was driven primarily by COVID-19. Companies basically with workers going remote. They were basically had problems. So they came to Zscaler. In Q4, ZPA represented 28% of our business. And when I take a look at our pipeline, our pipeline is well balanced between ZIA and ZPA. The question that came up in Q3 was, is this a onetime event? And basically, once COVID, this surge of curve COVID adoption goes away, is ZPA going to tail off? And our feeling at the time in Q3 was, no. It wasn’t. We’re looking at our pipeline. We see what customers want. And that, in fact, has been the case. We’ve not seen a drop off, related to the interest in ZPA.</p>
<p class="p p3">And what that says basically to me is – and to us is that, companies now are focusing on – that their networks of yesterday are not adequate for today’s world. And so they’re rethinking their networks. And that is the digital transformation, which is occurring, which is what Zscaler was built to do 10 years ago. So for 10 years, we’ve been developing this platform. And it started off with secure web gateway with ZIA. And then we put ZPA. And now we’re putting – now we’re expanding the platform with more services like CSPM and CASB out-of-band and the browser isolation.</p>
<p class="p p3">But in addition, we’re moving towards basically user experience, because when you sit between the user and the application, you know everything along the way. And if you’re a company, if something breaks down or users getting poor performance, we are in position to basically tell you where that is. So that the expansion into that ZDX is an important avenue that we’re taking currently. In addition, we’re moving to workload segmentation, which is basically server-to-server, workload-to-workload, app-to-app and basically segmenting the work because the network – company’s networks, whether it’s on-prem or any public cloud that go into micro segmentations. So what Zscaler basically has done is really expanded its TAM. And ZPA is a important part of it and again, the balance is good. And we’re excited about the new products coming out.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Patrick Colville</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Got it. That’s very clear. Thank you very much. Well, Jay, I mean, I think the area we should probably discuss now is ZIA. And I guess, again, it’s all through the competitive dynamics because SASE is a domain that Zscaler arguably kind of pioneered. And fast forward now to September 2020, and you’ve got Prisma Access there, you’ve got Cisco Umbrella and Check Point, Fortinet have also released solutions. I mean, so when you’re in front of customers, how do you – why do you win versus those guys?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Jay Chaudhry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So it’s architecture. SASE has become a buzzword. SASE is actually a framework of collection of things. If you read SASE properly, SASE says, for users going to the Internet, you should have a proxy architecture. Do these former vendors have a proxy architecture? They don’t. Do they want to overlook their claim? Yes. They still want to claim. That they are a SASE. So really, the discussion, the project doesn’t start around, say, do you have SASE or not from a customer’s point of view. I think SASE is more of return pushed by vendors, and maybe it’ll get adopted over time by customers.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">The customers call us and say, I would like to do my digital transformation. And when we go in and we walk them through how we do their transformation, it starts with them saying, look, Internet is becoming my network, I don’t need to do network security. I highlighted a couple of wins during my prepared remarks that in two cases that I highlighted, their existing firewall vendor went to them and say, I could do that, too.</p>
<p class="p p4">And the customer said, you don’t have a proxy architecture to do security and inspection. Sorry, they got disqualified upfront. Would you call that competition? I don’t. If somebody tries to get in, arrays and get disqualified, they’re not competitors. I hardly have any bake-offs with firewall vendors. Especially on the high-end because that’s where we play. It is possible that they’ll be able to win some deals on the low-end, where enterprise is on security savvy, and they can tell the difference. But if you talk to any of the global truth earned company, they’re savvy in almost every case. We essentially help them drive transformation. I don’t really get into bake-offs with the traditional legacy competitors.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Patrick Colville</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it. Okay. And we touched on ZIA and ZPA. A question I get from investors is, what’s the cross-sell opportunity between the two? And what proportion of your base has both those tools? And how should we think about kind of that going forward?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Jay Chaudhry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. So if you – I mean, we started with ZIA, our flagship product. Building ZIA was not a trivial task. It’s about eight, nine-point products that are needed by different vendors. Needed from different vendors to have full security for users who went to the Internet. And ZPA also does the same kind of stuff for inbound traffic by eliminating and sorted many products. It was a massive effort to build a proper platform. And now, as we have mature platform with both things to work from anywhere to realize the dream, you do need ZIA and ZPA both. That’s why when COVID happens, a customer’s – Zscaler customer who had ZIA jumped on to ZPA pretty quickly. And the new customers started buying ZIA and ZPA together. We saw some of that in Q3. We saw a lot more of that in Q4. In fact, in Q4, we had far more combined deals for ZIA, ZPA for new logo customers than before.</p>
<p class="p p4">Now in spite of all the upsell we did for ZPA in our installed base, if you look at our Fortune 2000 companies, only about one-third of them have ZPA. That means, approximately two-third of the companies haven’t bought ZPA yet. When I talk to these customers, they tell me that, look, we are about zero trust architecture. Zero trust is actually widely understood, advocated architecture in enterprises. And they said, yes, in March and April, we had to order something. We had not looked at a ZPA, we are not familiar with it. When we had to get things up and running, in days, we ordered a bunch of more VPN boxes. And – but that was done as a tactical stop. And they’re all moving in our direction with ZPA. I think it’s a matter of time, I believe almost all of our customers will embrace ZPA, and that presents a big opportunity for us.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Patrick Colville</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Nice. And I guess, translate that to numbers, Remo, you gave us some guidance last week, and your guidance suggests pretty stellar revenue growth in the first quarter. If I’m not mistaken, it’s about low 40s revenue growth next quarter, but then kind of suggestive in your fiscal year guidance that it tails out towards the end of the year, and it’s more like kind of low 30s growth by the end of the year. So I guess, how should we think about the numbers? And is the coronavirus, this – is it – and is the tailwind going to kind of fade out? I mean or just help us understand, how the anecdotal stuff we’re talking to translates into dollars?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Remo Canessa</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. What Patrick is referring to is Q1, the revenue guidance of $131 million to $133 million is 40%, 42% growth. Fiscal 2021 for the year, its 34% to 37% growth at 580 to 590. All I can say, Patrick, is we want to be prudent with our projections. All I can say is that we see digital transformation being an accelerant. We’re seeing the business as strong and related to projections that I put out, I want to be prudent.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Patrick Colville</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Got it. Okay. And I mean, has there been any occasions of, I guess, downside deals as a result of COVID? I mean – or has it been almost universally pretty rosy for you guys? Well, pushed out question as well.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Remo Canessa</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. Yes. I mean, it’s a great question. And when I think of digital transformation, I think a lot of companies say they are in this digital transformation basically, phase. And I don’t think they are. Zscaler truly is. From a churn rate perspective, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year in Q4, they’re basically flat because there was really no change. Having said that, since – do we have customers in industries like transportation, leisure? We do. Are they feeling the effects, basically, both layoffs and things like that? Somewhat. They are. Related to our projections that we’re giving for fiscal 2021, have we internally plan for a higher return rate?</p>
<p class="p p5">We have. Do I think it’s going to be significant? I don’t. Do I think that there’s even with reductions ceased, so I think there’s potential that we can sell additional services? I do. The – if you think of Zscaler as a platform, and the reduction in expenses that we have and if you’re a company, who’s going through a restructuring, and you have the ability basically to basically replace a point products with a platform. Even with reduced feeds, it is not possible, but I think companies have real look at it and think about Zscaler’s platform. That’s the digital transformation that is occurring.</p>
<p class="p p5">So yes, Q4 is flat, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year of churn. Are we taking into account going forward? We are. Is digital transformation in full force? It is. Are companies going to rethink about what they have versus putting additional services with Zscalers? I think, they will.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Jay Chaudhry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. One thing I would add is, one thing, Patrick, I would add is, with the financial pressure that every CFO and CIO is facing, they are asking us to accelerate, help them accelerate consolidation and simplification of IT to reduce cost and operational overhead needed for IT people to run it. So we’re seeing our deal size growing. The COVID is actually – is not a one-time event for us. It’s accelerating the mindset change that things can be done much better without doing this traditional way of networking and security. So in my view, it’s actually helping us significantly because inertia can be a force to slow you down. And it’s melting away the inertia.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Patrick Colville</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. I mean, interesting. And I guess, I mean, the other thing that we get a lot of questions on from investors is around the acceleration in sales reps. So if I’m not mistaken in fiscal 2020 that you just recently closed out the Zscaler increased sales rep headcount by a net 60%. So help us understand, I guess, how that went? And then what the effect of that increase would be for the coming years, these guys ramp?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Remo Canessa</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. Jay, do you want me to take that? Or…</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Jay Chaudhry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">No. You get started. I’ll add on to it.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Remo Canessa</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. Yes, last year, which is it going into the planning process prior to the start of fiscal 2020, we knew Dolly is going to come on board, and we felt we had the right person. And we decided to take a bet. To increase our sales capacity because we wanted to basically see the position to really go after this market. What happens basically when Dolly came on board, the first thing he did was, the absolute right thing. He built the infrastructure quickly. Sales operations, sales enablement, the value management office as well as a new layer of leadership in the sales organization, which is a regional VP, which reports up to an Area VP, which were, of course, up to a CEO, VP.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">So spend control is decreased, which was very important. And so in the first half of fiscal 2020, we talked about it, we knew that – and there’s high turnover. So there’s high turnover with our field quota of sales reps. And we knew it was going to happen, and it did. In the second half, with that leadership in place, our comment was based on what we’re seeing. We were seeing a significant inflow of really strong field quota sales reps because the leadership is in place and they hire them. So the big, big, a significant portion of that field quota of sales reps came aboard in the second half of fiscal 2020.</p>
<p class="p p6">So now we are – so now, going into this planning process, into fiscal 2021, we’re seeing momentum coming to us. And the decision that we made was that we want to keep our foot on the gas and the investment in the field organization what we said, will increase an aggregate percentage, even though percentage is significant. We’re going to increase the number of sales reps we hire in fiscal 2021, the absolute number, they’re still hired in fiscal 2020. So I can tell you that we’re off to a great start in Q1.</p>
<p class="p p6">And so what we see is that, when you’re building a company, you want to make sure we have the capacity, you want to make sure, you’ve got the structure in place, which we do. You want to make sure you get the product, which we have. And you want to make sure that you continue to innovate, and that’s what we’re going to be doing. So we’re going to be – we’re going to make investments – we’re going to balance investments and profitability. And as we talked about on our call, we expect to be at 20%, 22% operating profitability in fiscal 2024. Here we just see a huge market opportunity and the best interest of our shareholders is to continue to invest. And that’s what we’re doing. And we’re excited about it.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Jay Chaudhry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, finally, Patrick, if I may add? With such a market opportunity and growing, we are investing growth. Growth is our number one priority, and you’re seeing that reflected in our growth on the sales team. And we haven’t talked of R&amp;D, but we are also significantly investing in R&amp;D.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Patrick Colville</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Wait, I mean, on the R&amp;D front, I mean, that’s a – to be honest, that leads nicely to I think a closing question is about these new product areas. So you mentioned earlier, very briefly, but what is ZDX and Zscaler B2B? And I guess because a lot of investors – or should investors be focusing on these products? Are they becoming significant? Or are we still at kind of early stages? Just talk us through those, guys?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Jay Chaudhry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. So very good question. So I mean, we have a large number of products, if you look at. If you start looking at each product at a time, browser isolation to Caspian, whatnot. So that’s why we have put these products in four meaningful solutions. I think of our offerings, the way a pharmaceutical company thinks of a pipeline, right? ZIA is in a market that’s ready. Its generating growth, its generating lots of revenue for us. ZPA was a baby four years ago. In four years, it has come from zero to about 28% of the new business sales done extremely well. So those two are driving a lot of growth today.</p>
<p class="p p6">The third solution area, I look at ZDX. This is digital experience, a brand new market. You know why it’s brand-new? Because no one was going directly over the Internet before data or notion we evangelized, now more and more people are. So the need of something to figure out, if it’s some of this performance bottlenecks, where are there. And we’re uniquely positioned because we happen to sit in the traffic path to understand it. ZDX is a new market, new product, but we are very bullish about what it can do, but knowing that every new product takes a little bit time just like ZPA took a little bit time. So – but it is – it’s a good opportunity. This is ready to go to the market and grow in – some in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">The fourth area is workload segmentation, workload protection in a public cloud. That’s a nascent, that’s a young market. And this is where there’s an opportunity to evangelize and grow. We think, in the next couple of years, this market would evolve and start getting to a more ready level, but early on, we’ll be evangelizing and innovating in this market. So we think we have plenty of products to really carry on our growth for a long, long time, and we won’t stop innovating from here. We’ll be doing a lot more innovations.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Patrick Colville</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, I appreciate it. I mean, honestly, it’s a great company to follow. So really appreciate your time today. Zscaler CEO, Jay Chaudhry, Zscaler CFO, Remo Canessa, thank you so much for the time. Really appreciate you joining us for the DB Tech Conference.</p>
