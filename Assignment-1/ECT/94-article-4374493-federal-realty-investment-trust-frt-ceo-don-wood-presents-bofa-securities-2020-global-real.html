<p class="p p1">Hi, it's Craig Schmidt of Bank of America Retail Research. I also have Alex Pernokas with us who will be handling any incoming questions from the attendee. Welcome to Federal Realty Investment Trust Roundtable. From Federal, we have Don Wood, President &amp; CEO; and then Dan G, the Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer. We're going to begin with a short overview of Federal and then I will start with questions and then we will -- again, if you do have a question, you can enter and submit them through the webcast and we will try to get them asked. But with that, Don, sorry, take it away.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Don Wood</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thanks, Craig. Sorry to step all over you this morning, I didn't realize, there was a big doubt, so thanks. And I appreciate everybody else for being on the call this morning. Let me give you a few minutes about who Federal is. I think most of you know but we'll do that for those of you who don't. We are a diversified retail company is the way I would like to talk of us really. We really -- if you think about retail and Federal, we are pretty much in every sector other than enclosed malls, about a third of our business is mixed-use. Properties, about a quarter of it is grocery-anchored, another quarter is super regional, and then other type of lifestyle and other properties for the rest of it. </p>
<p class="p p1">We're on the coasts by and large between Boston and Washington DC and then down Miami, on the East Coast and then throughout California in both Silicon Valley in the North and LA in the South. And we've been around for a long time, since 1962. We pride ourselves on having what we believe is the highest quality public retail company -- retail real estate company out there. The company has only had three CEOs in the last 58 years. And we have really, through, really all of that time they’d only focused on high quality. We have not been acquirers of large portfolios. Accordingly, this portfolio that we have is really hand selected, one-off, over that period of time, which allows us to treat real estate on a very localized basis. And certainly in a period like COVID, that's more important than ever.</p>
<p class="p p1">Individual deals, individual retailers, individual locations, handled by senior people throughout this has been critical. Lots of conversations always during times like this about the collections percentages. So let me get that out of the way. Although, I think it's only one metric that is to be discussed. In the second quarter, we collected about 68% of our rents. In July, that was up to 76%. And in August, we collected 80% of the contractual monies that were owed to us. 80% is not good but it’s certainly a improved trend and I hope that -- to see that trend continue. But it still means business is up 20%, obviously the stock is up 40%. And the uncertainty that remains with respect to COVID over the next year or two or three, remains.</p>
<p class="p p1">We are built to -- effectively with a balance sheet that's really strong and with a very diversified income stream. Some of that is good during COVID, some of that's not good during COVID, but very diversified nonetheless, which is good for -- certainly for the long-term. We very much believe we will come out of this stronger on the other side and effectively become the retail, even more so, of choice for demand in three areas that we see ourselves getting. That is, first of all, in air -- open air to open air, tenants who are increasing -- they're getting better quality real estate than moving up if you will, certainly reloads from mall, the open air, what we see as the second category. And because we're in those first ring suburbs, urban to suburban, we’ve seen a lot of that actually interestingly in the restaurant side, in particular with respect to those restaurants that are looking for places outside city centers and looking at those first tier suburbs. So that's kind of who we are. We have as many of you know, say an increased dividend every year since 1967. It's an important record for us, but it's not something that could not be broken to the extent the -- this pandemic carried on for a number of years. But it is something that's important and we do see a path on the other side to continue to pay for it. So that's what we're trying to do. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">And with that, let me turn it back over to you, Craig.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p2"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Q - Craig Schmidt</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay, thank you. You have -- you differ from your peers in quite a bit in your portfolio. Maybe you could run us through how your different product types [Audio Gap] some of your office and resi along with your more standard shopping centers?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Sure. Well, look as you're sitting in the middle of a global pandemic, where you're facing closing down the [Audio Gap] be in the best position to continue to pay the rent. And as they have in the 25% of our business that is grocery-anchored and drugstore-anchored and other necessity-based businesses, and that's terrific. And you would also expect, I would think, whether your job is of theaters, which make up a couple of percent of our income stream, or whether you talk about restaurants, which make up 15% of our income stream, half of which is quick-serve type of restaurants that continue to perform well, and the other half being more sit-down type of restaurants, which are harder to effectively be capitalized and work through this pandemic. And certainly, the 3% or so of that is fitness uses that have been greatly impacted. </p>
<p class="p p2">So, there's certainly a piece of our business in total, 20% or 22%, something like that, that is significantly impacted by global pandemic. Interestingly, I think -- and then over -- let me just go on to the mixed-use for a second. We also have 10% of our business, which is residential products, all at our mixed-use locations, and they paid 95%, 96% of the rent that is owed, that has been abnormal, if you will, put that way. And the office side, which to-date has -- which include our largest tenant, Splunk on the West Coast that is -- they paid all, and in total the office tenants have paid upwards of 90% also. So, they bring up the numbers if you will, but those are part and parcel of the integration of mixed-use. And we look at that all as one as you would expect.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay. And then, we're experiencing record high bankruptcy and store closing through mid-September, what do you expect the trajectory of store closings will be in the last three and a half months of the year?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. I don't know. Obviously, we're at a time where the -- those companies that entered into COVID week, and there were plenty of them, I mean, look, retail has been -- we've been over-retailed as a country for a very long time, and this has certainly accelerated the failure rates of a lot of businesses. And so, I do see -- we're certainly not done in my view with respect to the bankruptcies, whether that happens in this fall or whether it happens in the winter time, is this more customary in our business? I don't know. It's a weird year to begin, but we're certainly not done, and which really brings it to the big point. And it is, what are you going to do on the other side of this? Where are you going to create the demand to fill those vacancies? And I just -- of all the things I'm worried about, and there are plenty of them, is not finding tenants to effectively fill what we believe is the best quality portfolio in the country.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay. That's good point. I mean, who is out there right now looking for new space? What -- how would you characterize your new leases?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">It's very interesting. So, it's kind of the three places that I went through when I -- it's real estate upgrades, open-air, looking for better open-air, I got a great example of that. I'm not going to mention the tenant yet, but here in Suburban Maryland where you can kind of picture this, there's a mall that is -- was just failing. Adjacent to the mall is a shopping center that had a Trader Joe's in it. The Trader Joe's leaves the marketplace, the rest of the tenants in that shopping center say, oh, no, we certainly won't want to be the last one out of here. Where are we going to go? And so we're able to cut deals and done one that I can't talk about just yet but we'll, for certainly more rent than that tenant was paying in our shopping center, which is much better located, closed. That's a natural thing that's going to happen. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">Thinking about a tenant’s mindset and the uncertainty of knowing who that tenant’s co-tenancy is going to be over the next five, six years is a real important driver to where they're going to do deals, just makes sense. The same thing with, I was talking about and closed, was open-air. And those conversations are very much in the works. They'll continue and they'll grow. The same thing as I said, from urban to suburban. The restaurants that we're talking to who are in Downtown DC, that are looking at Shirlington in Northern Virginia, Bethesda in Maryland and even up at Assembly. Those were downtown, looking at the Assembly and Linden Square, it’s pretty interesting.</p>
<p class="p p3">When you sit back and you think and imagine from that retailer's perspective, it's not just rent. It's about where you're going to be able to do business and where you're going to be able to do business has a lot to do with who else is going to be there. It's a really important distinction. And so the less risky, great real estate, where you have more clarity on who else is going to be your neighbor. Rises way up on the total vol of risk mitigation.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And also, you seem to be adding new supermarkets to some of your centers.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, sure, that's because they were doing deals. And those were pre-COVID deals that were end of works that finished up. I'm really interested -- and that's great. If that's the highest and best use for the community center, that's terrific. But it's really more about those deals going forward that are going to create the consolidated retail destinations, because not everybody can be a winner here. There's too much retail. So where are you going to consolidate to and with what tenant base? And that continues to need to be diversified in my view.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay. At this point, Alex, are there any questions from the field?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Alex Pernokas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Hi, yes, I have a -- we have a few questions from the field. So what is the impact of an over-retailed country on effective rents, which I believe Federal has some of the highest in the industry?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Sure. So there is no question that supply and demand is still very much alive in the country, and certainly there is downward pressure on rents from a macro sense of supply and demand. But we're not in a macro business. We're a local business and the reality is, the answer to your question depends on how successful we are in creating two people who want every spot, two people want a spot there, it's that simple, there's a horse race and there is upward pressure on rents. That's not going to be possible everywhere. There's no question. And so there will be downward pressures on rent, I can certainly see in certain markets that, that will be more so than in other places. But at the end of the day, every one of these deals too by the way more and more require capital. So, that notion of taking low rents and having the low rents go up by -- from $7 to 70 -- $7.70, right, we’re having low rent go up by 10%. What the capital necessary, it's the same cost about everywhere, plus or minus, and so putting in there additional capital with $0.70 more rent often doesn't make any sense. </p>
<p class="p p3">At the end of the day, those tenants want to be in a place where they can make money, where they're going to do the sales levels, where they're going to have the tenants around them that will send business their ways and do business because of them together, et cetera. And so rent doesn't become the number one thing. We'll have our share of successes there, we will have some negatives when you have such a macro event like this. But overall, I can tell you how we're going to create value at Federal shopping centers over the next three, four, five years. Not sure everybody can. </p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">AlexPernokas</span></strong></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">Great, thanks. And you answered one of the other questions during that response. So, I'll move on to the last one. As online becomes more important for retailers, this ends up being a margin negative for retailers. As a result, will these retailers not able to pay higher occupancy costs and how susceptible is your portfolio to this? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, this is such an important -- it's such an important point. The notion of how goods are delivered to the end user is still something that has hardly been solved. It's still better almost anywhere you look for the end users to come and pick up the goods at the store. There's no more profitable way for that to happen. As a result, one of the things that we are so focused on here is the ability to pick up at our shopping centers for a plethora of retailers to have our places be the place that are part and parcel of everything you do in your life. </p>
<p class="p p4">So, I think we're one of the only landlords to have a company-based landlord source, full-time program pulled to pickup that allows for that to happen throughout most of our shopping center portfolio, now, certainly, in our mixed-use properties where it's working particularly. Well, that's an important component to get to the answer to your question because the bottom line is -- here is at the end of the day, profitability comes in a number of ways. Prices will try to be raised, expenses will try to be reduced, all of that. But at the end of the day, demand has to exceed supply for -- from a from a real estate company's perspective for a landlord to make any money. We are already looking at demand drivers. Back to you Craig.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay, I also have a question and it's just, where do you see Federal's occupancy going for this portfolio in early 2021? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, I do think as a result of everything that's going on in the world, it is probably going to be that first quarter of 2021, second quarter of -- half of 2021 that will be the low point. I see us in the 80s. I don't know whether that really means 89, 87, 86, something like that but probably in an area like that, given how it takes to take conversations to turn them into leases, to turn them into building out the space, to turn them into occupation and rent start, that takes time. And so I would certainly expect from an occupancy perspective that first half of 2021 to be low point. </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. And then do you think there's going to be a reset on market rents in terms of, you’re finding new tenants to replace vacancy, but at what rents? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Exactly. I don't know, right? What I what I do know is, what is really important right now, is to do what you need to do to keep the strong tenants in your places to be able to attract other tenants on the other side. And so what we're trying hard to do is to effectively cut the deals that have to be cut either on a percentage rent basis for shorter terms to be able to get through this on to the other side. </p>
<p class="p p4">On the other side, again, whether those rents come up, go down or come up or where they go, I don't know for sure yet. I know that the answer to that question lies in the demand side. And tend to create better option if you will for the best spaces. I know, we got the best chance of doing that, given the quality of the real estate, but it remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Great. And maybe you could talk a little bit about the approximately $425 million of spend over the next three years for mixed-use and the $155 million over the next three years for the other projects? </p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, well, let me start with the big money on the big three mixed-use stuff, right, Santana, Assembly, and Pike and Rose. First of all, all three of them are well established at this point destinations. And so, I sit here in our offices at Pike and Rose and I see a very active feet out in front of me in terms of -- it doesn't feel like a new place, it feels like a place of hard part of the community. That's absolutely the case at Assembly and certainly at Santana.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">What we're building are simply add-ons to those established places. And I've made that distinction to be distinguished from brand new construction in a new destination. So we don't have that. And that's a really important risk mitigant first of all.</p>
<p class="p p5">On the other side of it, the product that we're basically building is office with retail below and in one case up in Assembly, residential, with retail down below. What is interesting to me is that even at these construction stages, the retail down below has leased up pretty darn well. And certainly at Assembly, including the CBS, including some other names I can't say yet, but in that next phase and that's great. The residential at Assembly is under pressure today, as given what's going on in Boston with not only education, but restrictions on what can happen et cetera.</p>
<p class="p p5">So with new product coming on in the next 18 months -- we still have time, but 18 months, I expect there to be rent pressure with respect to it, but filling it, no problem. The rest of it resolves. And when you think about office that keeps me up at night more than anything, because decision-makers aren't deciding today what they need for that office space and how much they need and are ready to do a deal.</p>
<p class="p p5">Now what I know is that up until COVID, we had great traction at all three places where our [previous] headquarters are and in Somerville, out at Santana Row, where we were at leases with a full building user that got put on hold in March at Pike and Rose where we had a lot of smaller tenants. And in almost every case, those things are let’s keep them warm, but not to a deal right now. And that's natural. That's what you’d expect to see. Now, we're still a year, two years out on that construction, so as to how that plays out. But that is a question mark for the timing, if you will, of those users making those decisions. </p>
<p class="p p5">In terms of the other projects, Darien, Connecticut, where we're underway on now, I was actually up there on Saturday -- Friday of last week. I'm very, very positive about the residential over retail property that we're going to have there and I think it's going be a beneficiary of some of the move from New York out to the suburbs, real positive.</p>
<p class="p p5">Similarly, in Miami, CocoWalk, which is just about done right now. The retail leasing is going well. We are only a few months away from the first 10 to start opening and then more of that in 2021. If you haven't seen it, check it out man, you won't believe the difference in terms of what we did there. I’m very proud of that. That should be strong. We had our first move in -- up in Dallas, came with a residential project that's beside -- behind the shopping center there. So I feel real good about all of it, subject to like the timing of the balance of the office lease-up. But I know we're building the right product and I know it's in the right locations. The only thing I have uncertainty to is the timing on that.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. Let me try Alex again. Are there any other questions from the field?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Alex Pernokas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure. Two questions. Are you seeing strong tenants renegotiate rents and they know that they're strong tenants and can likely take advantage of the current situation?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Of course. Will you? Absolutely. Sure. And our job on the other side is to do our best to negotiate that from our position of strength to the extent we’re having it. Some we win, some we lose. But sure everybody is.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Alex Pernokas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And then street retail values are generally down in many of your markets. Is this an area of interest for you?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Could be -- it could be, it's really interesting. We by kind of just the way this company grew over a long period of time, we aren't that first tier suburb kind of company. And so, in those markets, what we're seeing though is being the beneficiary of the uncertainty in the CBDs. And so, what happens, how that plays out, what that does to values and the cities will be interesting to watch. We'll be watching that as we go along. But also, in these first ring suburbs, which I just really like the demand drivers that we're seeing there, we'll keep an eye on that too.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Alex Pernokas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Great. Thanks. And what are maybe your yield expectations for development projects if changed at all?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">No. I don't have really much to say about that, costs are up a little bit, but that's not -- that's really more a matter of the time that things are taken because of COVID. And on the deal side in, I mean, we're hitting our numbers on the retail stuff to this point, the big leases that we have in place, whether that be PUMA which is a big one or a number down in CocoWalk and one or two here in Pike and Rose, they are on budget. So, it's about the future, and I don't have visibility to talk about the remaining office yields or remaining residential yields.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Alex Pernokas</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Thank you. Craig, that’s it for questions.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. Thanks. Don, what do you think are some potential catalysts for Federal going forward? What are the things that might move your stock?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Well, it's not your job, Craig, it does move. But what I will say is, certainly, look, from our -- I think we've got to prove the demand notions that we talked about. I think we got to announce some deals. I think basically we've got to have everybody on this call say, yes, I know their rents are higher than other guys, but they're higher than other guys for a reason. And these are the properties that people are consolidating into and yes, worried about the timing of the office deals but boy just announced this big one. I think there are things like that. In other words, it should be the same in my view for everybody, prove it, prove it, don't look at this month or last month or next month, make sure you understand that on the other side of this there is not only a viable company but that there is a path to grow, that there's a way to create value, that I'm pretty confident of.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. I also have three rapid fire questions. And if you could just...</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Rapid fire…?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. With one word, quick replies. The first question. What causes you the most concern in the near to medium-term? One, no vaccine or taking longer than expected to get distributed? Two, second COVID wave? Three, impacts of job layoffs to come?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Near-term second COVID wave.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Great. Question two. Do you think the worst is behind us in terms of economic conditions? Yes or no? If no, when do you think we'll see the worst data, 4Q '20, first half '21, second half 21?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. First Q '21.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Craig Schmidt</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. And then the last question, which of the following real estate sectors will suffer the most long-term damage from the pandemic: lodging, malls, office or senior housing? </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Don Wood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Malls. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Craig Schmidt</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. Well, that pretty much brings us towards the end of the call. I want to thank Federal for agreeing to do the call and best of luck through the conference and thanks all the attendees who called in to listen to this roundtable. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Don Wood</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Thanks, everybody. </p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Craig Schmidt</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay. Take care. Bye.</p></div>
