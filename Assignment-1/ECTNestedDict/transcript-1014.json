      "Ashley Buchanan": [
         "Thank you for joining us this morning. We delivered strong second quarter results and are effectively positioning Michaels for the future. As our stores reopen in the quarter we saw an immediate and sustained recovery in demand that largely kept pace with what we have initially seen in May.",
         "Our entire store base has been opened since the beginning of July. Now to discuss in a moment, we continue to prioritize the safety of our team members, and our customers, as they return to shop at our physical locations.",
         "We were extremely pleased by the demands and trends in our stores and with how well our team members executed. I want to extend my gratitude to our entire team and to our makers for their ongoing commitment and support in this unprecedented environment.",
         "I also want to take a moment to welcome Mike Diamond our CFO who joined us officially just a few days ago. I look forward to working closely with Mike, and believe his experience will be valuable in supporting our ongoing efforts to position Michaels for long term success. He is here in the room with us today and he will introduce himself later in the call. I'm sure many of you have an opportunity to speak with Mike and get to know him over the coming months.",
         "Back to our results. We believe that COVID 19 is providing some strong tailwinds for our business resulting from lifestyle changes such as more time at home, and the need for creative outlets, as well as a same broader macro trends impacting the rest of market.",
         "Additionally factors including Federal stimulus are difficult to predict and may introduce some variability as we move forward.",
         "I want to start today by briefly providing an update on the three key focus areas that I outlined last quarter. First as I mentioned, we remain focused on the health and safety of our team members and customers. The protocols we implemented across our stores earlier this year are still in place. This includes social distancing, increased cleaning, and sanitation measures, plexiglass shields at checkout, mask requirements, and more.",
         "Creating a safer environment inside our stores, so our team members, and customers can work, and shop with confidence remains a key priority for our team. Second, we have solidified and improved our financial position. Based on the strong trajectory of our business in the second quarter, we repaid the remaining $300 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility.",
         "With this undrawn and fully available credit facility and a strong free cash flow of over $300 million generated during the second quarter, we ended the period with $1.3 billion of liquidity. I am very pleased to report with the strong cash generation, our total liquidity has increased by approximately $100 million since the beginning of the fiscal year.",
         "And third, we have continued to expand and improve our digital and omni channel capabilities to provide Makers with a more seamless shopping experience. By taking an agile approach to developing and [deploying] new capabilities quickly, we are capturing sales, delivering a high level of customer satisfaction, and building on our earlier progress.",
         "During the second quarter, we enhanced curbside to provide an even smoother contactless pickup experience. We optimized our shift from store network, we introduce product bundling for e commerce orders to make customer purchasing easier and additionally initial results from our internal testing of the shop in scan are encouraging.",
         "We expect our contactless in store shopping experience, powered by the Michaels app to be a huge differentiator for us as customers increasingly prioritize convenience and safety.",
         "And finally, in August, we launched Michaels Pro as a critical extension of our assortment. This offering allows Makers to purchase competitively priced bulk supplies, for which customer feedback is indicated to be an essential need. This is part of our omni channel strategy to attract new Makers and gain a larger share of wallet.",
         "Overall I'm very pleased with this quarter's progress in reducing friction points from the shopping experience. Importantly we have significant runway and will continue to irrupted and innovate in the coming quarters.",
         "Next I would provide an update on the pillars that underpin our Maker strategy which include, one, strengthen our retail foundation, two modernizing the omni channel experience, and three establishing our positions as the expert for Makers.",
         "Importantly as we work on these pillars we are prioritizing opportunities to expand our value proposition to better serve our Maker customers. We are listening to them. We are executing on their feedback and as a result we are meeting more of their expectations.",
         "First with regard to our foundation, we are improving execution across our retail business. The theory is very simple, provide the right product at the right price, where, and how the customers expected. In these efforts we begin to optimize the flow of merchandise from truck-to-shelf to ensure inventory availability, and limit out of stocks.",
         "To enhance our in store shopping experience we are improving our regional merchandising, product placement, and pipelines. Our customers also want to engage with team members. We are simplifying in store tasks to increase efficiency for our team members and free of labor hours that we can be redeployed to more customer facing activities.",
         "In addition to this foundational retail work we plan to open our acquired AC Moore stores as Michaels stores in 2021 and capitalize on the resulting sales transfer opportunity.",
         "Hand-in-hand with improving retail execution, we are rapidly modernizing, and involving our omni channel capabilities to provide an increasingly frictionless customer experience. This evolution is happening far faster than expected and combined with strong demand across our 1270 physical locations, is creating positive tangible results for our business.",
         "And finally we are working to position Michaels as the expert brand for our Maker in order to deepen our customer relationships and foster long term value engagement. Our recently introduced marketing campaign Made By You featuring real Makers and their creative works has been well received by our customers.",
         "We are doing more ideas, inspiration instruction that encourage creativity and connect the making community to our brand.",
         "A significant offering of virtual classes and other interactive content is an important element extending the impact of our branding. With little to no travel to summer and in the absence of in person summer camps and other activities for children, our customers spent increased amounts of time at home and look to Michaels for a positive and inspiring outlets for self expression or simply just to fill up the day.",
         "We offered an online kids club camp creativity featuring 21 native free crafting for our many Makers. Our online class content has been very well received and we are increasing that content available offering up to 25 weekly classes in September up from only four in April. Viewership of these classes are growing between parents and kids. Over only a four month timeframe, we recorded over 200,000 signups for online classes.",
         "To further foster and drive interest in a cohesive Maker community, we\u2019re also continuing to increase our use of personalized e mails reaching the 70% milestone in July up from only 20% at the end of 2019.",
         "Additionally in early August, we launched our revamped Michaels rewards loyalty program, which is designed to create long term engagement with our program members, and help strengthen our relationship across the Maker community.",
         "We remain committed to looking for ways to enhance this program to better serve, and engage with our members. And while we\u2019re still very early, we're pleased with the initial results.",
         "Now I'll turn the call over to Jennifer Robertson to review our second quarter financial results in greater detail. ",
         "Thanks Jennifer as we sit here today are month in to the third quarter I am encouraged by our progress against a backdrop of considerable uncertainty. Our focus remains on executing against our Maker strategy and gain market share as we attract and retain new customers and deepen our connection with existing customers through focused merchandising, marketing and omni-channel initiatives.",
         "The significant strides we have made in a short period of time demonstrate that we had the right strategic vision with the right talent and executional capabilities to deliver.",
         "We will go into much greater detail on our strategic plans and progress on our Virtual Investor Day on September 24th. On behalf of the Michaels executive team I want to invite you to join as we discuss our addressable market, go forward strategy, future omni-channel plans as well as merchandising priorities.",
         "We will provide a longer, term financial out algorithm for Michaels and discuss our capital allocation priorities. There will also being opportunity for you to engage with our management team during a lot of Q&A sessions. Please visit the Michaels Investor Relations website to preregister.",
         "Before we go to the Q&A portion of the call I want to take a moment to thank Jennifer Robinson Jim Sullivan and the whole finance team for doing a fantastic job during whole of the very challenging time for the company.",
         "Thanks to your leadership and hard work we haven't missed a beat and made considerable progress over the last 8 months.",
         "Now I would like to invite our new CFO, Mike Diamond to briefly introduce himself, Mike.",
         "Thanks Mike, it's great to have you on board, operator, let\u2019s move into the Q&A portion of the call."
      ],
      "Jennifer Robinson": [
         "Thanks Ashley. Michaels continues to make great progress against our key initiatives which enabled us to capture strong customer demand in the quarter.",
         "Our second quarter results were impacted by several tailwinds including impacts from government stimulus, and the fact that our customers are spending more time at home.",
         "Our second quarter revenue was negatively impacted by not having all our stores open until the beginning of July, as well as broader macro uncertainty. For these reasons forecasting remains difficult, but we are encouraged by our second quarter performance, and know that the overall third quarter sales trends observed through today's call remain strong.",
         "We will continue to monitor developments across our business closely as we move through the coming weeks and months.",
         "For the quarter sales totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 11% on a year over year basis. Comp store sales grew 12% year over year. The 12% quarterly comp was driven by a combination of existing customers with higher basket size, increase in new customers, and continued strength in e commerce results, even as our stores reopened to strong demand on improving foot traffic.",
         "We are particularly encouraged by the new customer additions which were up more than 15% year over year, and we are working to retain and engage with these new customers.",
         "Moving down the income statement. Costs related to COVID 19 totaled $9 million and were primarily SG&A related with the majority driven by hazard pay and other employee safety related costs.",
         "Gross profit for the quarter was $343 million. The year over year decline was primarily due to the charges related to the closure of our wholesale business as well as a higher mix of e commerce sales, and the impact of tariffs.",
         "We will begin to lap the tariff impacts in the second half of 2020. Occupancy cost leverage as a result of higher sales, as well as benefits from our ongoing pricing, and sourcing initiatives offset this decline. Excluding the costs related to our wholesale business gross profit would have been approximately $388 million representing a year over year increase of $21 million or 6%.",
         "Rent for the quarter totaled approximately $100 million. SG&A for the quarter was 25.2% of sales and down slightly in absolute dollars year over year. SG&A this quarter benefited from the actions we have taken to rationalize spending across the company.",
         "Operating income for the quarter were $53 million, which was ahead of our expectations, and driven by strong customer demand. On an adjusted basis excluding the impact of our wholesale business, operating income was approximately $106 million up over 40% from 2019.",
         "Moving to tax. The increase in tax expense in the quarter was due primarily to a change in the estimated impact of the CARES Act and a tax benefit associated with a tax income settlement in the second quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, EPS in the quarter was $0.30, up almost 58% versus prior year.",
         "Cash flow was strong in the quarter. We generated positive free cash flow of $331 million and ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in total liquidity comprised of a cash balance of $650 million and full availability on our revolving banks facility. We will continue to manage our cash and liquidity while we invest in our omni channel capabilities to meet the growing customer demand.",
         "During the first half of the year we significantly changed the working capital profile of our business. And we're seeing the benefits of a shorter cash conversion cycle in these results.",
         "Please note that we will still see some volatility in our cash flow generation during the year driven by the underlying seasonality of our business.",
         "Importantly with more liquidity now versus at the beginning of our fiscal year we are very confident in our ability to invest for growth, satisfy all debt obligations and generate significant excess cash which gives us additional flexibility.",
         "We will talk more about our plans here during our upcoming Investor Day. Finally from an inventory perspective we feel good about our current position as we head into the back half of the year.",
         "Now I'll turn the call back over to Ashley."

            "Thanks good morning everybody can you talk about the cadence for the quarter including, how [indiscernible] on the basis, how did the store only comps play out of the quarter and it looks like you have percentage of your stores closed during the quarter and then related to that, you mentioned the strong sales quarter to date given what many are reporting as moderation in August on back to school can you talk about what you're seeing thus far relative to what you saw during July?"

         "Speaker": "Christopher Horvers"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, our comps improved throughout the quarter as the stores reopened we ended up with a 12% overall we began June with roughly a 1000 stores open and we're fully open by the beginning of July and that 12% comp is inclusive of the 353% increase in e-comm.",
            "We're not going to provide a month to month and analysis just like we did last time, but for the second quarter open store comp including e-comm was North of 20% and to your question on how we are quarter to date August demands remain very strong as we exited Q2 into Q3 in the longer term I believe the foundational structural change that we made they\u2019ll continue to better position Michaels as we go forward to gain share.",
            "And on your back to school question, back to school for us is mainly an August event and like I said we're really pleased with the way August is shaping up so far. It's remained strong and we will see but right now we're really pleased with the way we ended the Q2 and the way we're going into Q3"

         "Remarks": [
            "Understood just a follow-up, can you share some thoughts on the gross margin rate outlook going forward how large was the tariff headwind in the second quarter and towards the back half you have some pretty significant markdown you [indiscernible] negative mix promotions if you post a positive comp in the back half could you see gross margin actually expand on a rate basis year-over-year?"

         "Speaker": "Christopher Horvers"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah so first we'll address the questions related to Q2 gross margin for as a reminder the gross margin in Q2 includes $45 million and costs associated with the closure of the wholesale business so after that we would be in the $388 million and from a rate perspective we did see headwinds on rates related to the tariffs as we have indicated would be the case and that subsides significantly as we go into the back half of the year and begin to lap it compared to the first half of the year.",
            "Our focus will continue to be on maximizing gross margin dollars soon as e commerce is a larger percentage of our sales we do have dilution there but the company is definitely focused on maximizing dollars and we were profitable across all of our nodes in Q2."

            "Hey guys thanks for taking the question nice quarter. I want to talk a little bit more about how you're planning second quarter in this sort of uncertain environment it sounds like things are healthy right now. I think there was a comment that you feel good about our inventory position as you head in to the second half of the year.",
            "It does look like inventory is down about 19% so my question is, is that by design is that the effort to clean up the inventory and optimize it or your facing some limitations how are you planning for that and how should we thinking about it?"

         "Speaker": "Seth Sigman"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "That's a good question. We're down 19% but if you take out the Darice wholesale business which we exited is down 15% and a couple of things so we do feel really good about our inventory position as we go into the back half of the year a couple of reasons around that one a lot of our sales are is broad based across all the categories but a lot of it is our functional business which has a shorter lead time the second part is the mix shifts a bit and in Q3 and Q4 and seasonal.",
            "And we didn\u2019t really buy down our seasonal business in Q3 Q4 very much and then what we did use this demand period to clean up a lot of the clearance as we got actually less promotional so it mixed out a lot for us so it is the combination of we cleaned up sum clearance Darice it was a portion of it, a mix shift and short of lead time so we feel good about our inventory positions going into the back half."

      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, all right that's helpful and then a follow-up question on e commerce growth it is interesting that it accelerated in the second quarter even as your stores opened. I'm curious did you see that elevated growth continue in the latter part of the quarter when stores were fully opened and running again and just any more color on the behavior that you're seeing the influence of rolling out curbside and ship from store and whether that's accounting for a big portion of the growth and how does that time to profitability as well? Thank you."

         "Speaker": "Seth Sigman"
      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well we were really pleased with our e-comm business it is over 350%. It was strong throughout the quarter obviously I mean it decelerated just slightly as all the stores reopened as and you would expect as you got 1270 stores right back open, but customers engaged with us in a lot of ways this time whether it was buy online, pick up at store, with that was curbside which we made improvements on. We did ship from store but then we also did same-day delivery and our app obviously had a lot more effectively as we expanded our ability to make commerce through the app.",
            "So it\u2019s clear that our customers are interacting with us in multiple ways and we're really pleased with that because our goal has been the same since I started which is I want to meet the customer wherever they want to be met and we're agnostic on which channel they go through like I said we're profitable on all notes, but we want to meet them where they want to be met and we're very pleased with the way that business is trending"

      },
      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So e-comm as a result of the fulfillment and shipping costs is dilutive to our gross margin rate, however as we have indicated it is definitely gross margin dollar positive for us. The significant amount of sales going through curbside and BOPIS definitely offset that dilution along with the incremental shipping nodes that we opened up with ship from store during the quarter so those things help mitigate the dilution of our e commerce to gross margin."

      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And I\u2019ll add to that a little bit. Our mix in the way we sell and fulfill e-comm between curbside, same-day delivery and buy online pickup in store obviously is a more profitable node than the direct to home business, but even with the direct to home business we're making significant progress on our cost, reducing splits the topper product AR in the margin structure were selling through that channel so we feel we're making more progress across all the fulfillment channels and nodes that we're using in our e-comm business."

      "18": {
         "Remarks": [
            "One other item to note in Q2 that was a bit of a headwind is tariffs. As Jennifer mentioned earlier and that headwind will subside as we get into the back half of the year. And then I guess at Investor Day will you quantify the e-comm mix and then how BOPIS or curbside mixes out with inside of that and then my follow-up question unrelated is, you went back the high-low pricing.",
            "I don't know how prevalent or representative that could be during the last quarter to the extent consumers were more price taking than bringing coupons but can you talk about the pricing strategy and did you see the percentage of customer's let us say shopping on coupon decline and how that is trending as stores reopened?"

      "19": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well I guess to address the first part which was well we have always been a high level retailer we never went to ADLP at any time pre-COVID or during COVID or whatever you want to call we are at right now in the middle of COVID we were less promotional during the quarter by design and I have talked about that last quarter which is we wanted to go from branding perspective to provide more inspiration, more creativity with discounts versus just a discounting brand our customers respond to that greatly with the content we put out and the inspiration we created through our marketing as we were less promotional during that timeframe.",

So somewhat of an anomaly in Q2 that we expect to be back more normalized if you will in the back half of the year. In addition to that, we do have headwinds on SG&A related to performance-based compensation which we had indicated at the beginning of the year would be a headwind for us in 2020 and we do expect that to see that in the back half of the year as well."

They wanted really competitive pricing on both products and we view that as a necessary extension to our offerings for that customer and they told us about what they wanted and we delivered and we\u2019ll probably go into much greater detail, we will go into much greater detail during our Investor Day around that initiative."
