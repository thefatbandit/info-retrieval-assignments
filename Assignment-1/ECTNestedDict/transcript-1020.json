         "Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Gaming and Leisure Properties\u2019 second quarter 2020 earnings call and webcast.",
         "The press release distributed yesterday afternoon is available on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website at www.glpropinc.com.

         "Greetings and welcome to Gaming and Leisure Properties Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.",
         "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Joe Jaffoni, Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin."
      ],
      "Peter Carlino": [
         "Thank you, Joe and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. As you all know, there have been eventful and unprecedented challenges that we and our triple-net competitors have faced this quarter. But I think on balance GLPI has weathered the crisis extremely well.",
         "As always, our team has issued a very detailed summary of activities over the quarter. So, I limit my summary remarks, but I think the important net result is that we have received 99, if I can get that word out, percent of our contractual rent through July. Additionally, I think we\u2019ve proved to be very flexible in helping our tenants meet liquidity or other business challenges in order to ensure that their long-term viability and success.",
         "As you all recognize by now, the partial opening of all, but a few of our tenants properties has produced stunning and unexpected results. Business volumes are surprisingly strong, but margins have proven to be even stronger. We expect to hear the same result from Penn National when it reports on August 6. This is probably the best time for me to say, what I\u2019ve been saying for years, and that is my belief that the real strength of our industry lies with the regional properties, not on the Las Vegas strip. Not only is the cash return on invested capital better, certainly with all the properties I\u2019ve been involved with over the years.",
         "But you\u2019re about to see again, that the resiliency of our tenants, regional properties far exceeds that of destination properties in Las Vegas; however, wonderful and exciting they might be. Let\u2019s be clear. I\u2019m not suggesting that Vegas properties are not extremely valuable, they are. But I want to make the case and I think this demonstrates it, that regional properties have long been undervalued and we deserve equal or even greater appreciation for that.",
         "Another bright spot that I would highlight is that within the triple-net space, our company is uniquely will collect virtually, a 100% of our rental income. Further, our tenants are largely distinguished public companies, whose earnings and issues are largely transparent. Not a lot of guesswork for investors about the health of gaming \u2013 about gaming REIT earnings, pretty open book.",
         "So with that, let me turn the call over to Steve Snyder, who will give you a lot more detail. Steve?"
      ],
      "Steve Snyder": [
         "Thank you, Peter and good morning, everyone. Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy through these crazy times. Just to clarify, although we\u2019ve been trying since last evening, we did file our second quarter 10-Q this morning in spite of some interruptions to the EDGAR system with the SEC.",
         "Before I move into the quarter, I just want to touch on some personal things and bear with me this will only be a few minutes. Obviously, my retirement is something that I\u2019ve been thinking about for quite some time, just having reached the age of 60, believe it or not. And about to be a first time grandfather, my wife and I have bought a place in Nashville and we look forward to spending a lot of quality family time in Nashville in the next years to come. So, it has been a fantastic run here at GLPI and previously at Penn.",
         "I joined Peter back in the late 1990s, and I\u2019ll be forever grateful to Peter, to the Board here at GLPI, and to the Board at Penn originally for giving me the opportunity to contribute to two transformative companies. I think while we were at Penn, we laid the foundation for Penn to now be the leading regional gaming operator here in the United States. And certainly, over the last seven years at GLPI, we\u2019ve created a new asset class in the triple-net lease space, which others have come to copy, which to me is the highest form of flattery.",
         "Finally, the value creation that we\u2019ve been able to achieve at both these companies is a testament to the talented and dedicated team members. I\u2019ve had the privilege to work with over these many years and I\u2019d be stepping away with a very talented group of the next generation of leaders for this company. So, I look forward to it.",
         "Moving forward into the quarter, it certainly was, as Peter mentioned, a strong quarter. it exceeded even the most optimistic scenarios that we looked at back in the dark days of March and April, and trying to evaluate what this unknown pandemic would mean to our businesses. Clearly, it\u2019s not over, it seems to be heating up in certain parts of the United States and gaining a little bit less traction in other parts of the United States. What we think the company, and most importantly, our operating partners, our tenants are well positioned to weather and get to the other side of this unprecedented pandemic that we\u2019re currently seeing.",
         "Part of the outperformance that we\u2019ve achieved has really been across all variable items in our business. The percentage rents in our Columbus and our Ohio businesses since they were able to reopen in June, exceeded our expectations, the operating performance in our two operating assets in our taxable REIT subsidiary just wildly exceeded any assumptions that we had made when we scenario-planned back in March and April. I give a lot of credit to our VP of Operations, Matt Hisco [ph] down in Perryville, who is also the GM in Perryville, as well as Jeannie Magnafrell [ph], our GM in Baton Rouge, and their teams for very effectively and efficiently, literally shutting down a business, furloughing folks and then bringing those businesses back online with unprecedented performance over the course of the weeks that they have been open.",
         "Lastly, on the expense side, we really were able to also outperform from an interest expense standpoint and you\u2019ll see that in the press release in terms of the effective execution that we did achieve and accessing the capital markets to term out some of our variable rate debt.",
         "Also during the quarter, as Peter touched on this, we spent a great deal of time, collaborating very closely with all of our tenants, and that\u2019s evidenced in some of the items that are highlighted in the press release. Spent a lot of time with our brethren across the parking lot at Penn coming up with rent credit program that really allowed them and proved to be the catalyst for them to achieve some pretty significant performance with respect to access to the capital markets, and most recently performance with respect to their assets.",
         "Also, the new Caesars team, we spent quite a bit of time with him. You saw that as evidenced by the lease amendments that we entered into, which I think really helped them set the stage for getting the final regulatory approval with the accommodations that we worked with them on with respect to the substitution of the assets in Indiana. So, I\u2019m certain that they will perform quite well now that they\u2019ve got their new platform under their belt.",
         "And lastly, we also spent quite a bit of time during the quarter with the folks at Boyd as evidenced by the approval of the Ohio Racing Commission to own the real property assets of Belterra Park, which now does stand in a separate lease. So, we have taken that real estate onto the balance sheet and no longer have a loan in place with respect to that asset.",
         "Also with respect to our public tenants; in all cases, we spent quite a bit of time providing them the necessary relief from non-payment covenants in all of our leases to give them runways back to normalization. Because these, as I\u2019ve said, are truly unprecedented times, and there\u2019s no point in using these times for a footpath under our existing leases. They need to get through to the other side and are well on a trajectory to do that.",
         "Lastly, in terms of the portfolio, we spent quite a bit of time during the quarter with the folks at Casino Queen. they were successful in procuring alone under the Payroll Protection Program plan that the federal government did put in place. We did get, as you\u2019ll see in the earnings release, a partial June rent payment of about $250,000. And we do expect to execute a deferred rent agreement with the new owners of the Casino Queen that will get us paid in full by year-end. We have elected to go to just cash recognition of the rent receipts from Casino Queen, given the situation that we find them in at this point in time.",
         "Finally, from liquidity and a balance sheet standpoint, we ended the quarter with an undrawn revolver with a complete capacity of $1.175 billion. We ended the quarter with $74 million of cash on the balance sheet, in terms of any near-term maturities; we\u2019ve got a $224 million term loan A1 that is due in April of next year. but beyond that, there are no other maturities until 2023. So, the company has been a tremendous liquidity position at this point in time to get through what remains of this pandemic.",
         "As it relates to leverage, you will note that our leverage did tick up modestly in the quarter relative to our EBITDA, not because the debt increase, in fact the opposite, but because of the modest decline in EBITDA affected by the pandemic. And we did, as it was noted in the press release, their second quarter dividend 80% in stock issuing about 2.7 million shares. And I will note for those on the call that that $0.60 quarterly dividend ended up being the lowest payout ratio that the company has ever paid at about 71% of the $0.84 AFFO that we reported, because you will see from the press release that our performance did exceed any of the consensus estimates that were out there on Wall Street.",
         "Finally, as GLPI moves forward, we clearly are still in the fire of this pandemic. But as Peter mentioned, I\u2019m very comfortable that regional gaming assets and our operating partners in particular, will lead the recovery of this asset class. And once normalized, our tenants will achieve the strongest four wall coverage of their lease obligations in the entire asset class.",
         "So with that operator, why don\u2019t we turn it over to the participants for any questions they\u2019d like to address to the management team?"

And I guess I\u2019ll start just with the dividend, is this the appropriate level? Is this the appropriate rate here and how are you thinking about the payout ratio going forward?"

            "Well, let me takeaway, it\u2019s Peter; let me take a quick whack at that. Look, we\u2019re going to do that ever is prudent looking ahead. Steve has said earlier, we\u2019ve matched what we\u2019re paying out in cash to what we get in cash. We expect the fall to be actually excellent. And so that we\u2019ll be taking a hard look at what the next quarter might offer exactly. But we\u2019re not going to make any commitment about that now, but I will highlight that as a shareholder, who kind of loves dividends personally that we\u2019ll get back to a normalized rate as early as we think is prudent. And that\u2019s really the best answer I can give you."

      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Yes. So, the top-down answer is really that the stage seems to be set \u2013 at least partially set for there to be some activity in the space. There\u2019s one thing that COVID taught us, it\u2019s that there\u2019s certain importance to solvency, and the value of permanent capital in our lease structures really as permanent capital gets. You can also look at where operators have priced debt in recent trades, and that suggests that our capital is attractive from the cost perspective. And when we look at our capital sources, we definitely see a functioning capital market. but from a bottom-up perspective, it feels a bit too early or soon, operators really been focused on survival, successfully reopening their properties.",
            "And the real question is going to be when they\u2019re going to be strategic reasons, be they rationalization, consolidation, regulation for assets to change hands. And when that happens, because of the ability to both help in pricing for transactions, and also the help with permanent capital in that maturity risk question, our sale leaseback structures, value proposition is really as relevant as ever and we definitely have been working to ensure that we have a seat at the table for all those discussions."

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Great. And then just the final one, Peter, you kind of touched on this, but as you look across the triple-net sector, maybe even beyond that, how do you see GLPI and the gaming REITs positioned in a long before coronavirus, there was an argument for cap rate compression, where do you think that stands now either coronavirus?"

         "Remarks": [
            "You kind of know what my answer\u2019s going to be Barry. It\u2019s better than ever. Look, we always said that these are state-sponsored businesses and most \u2013 that rely heavily on the kind of revenue that we generate for them. And that these places essentially don\u2019t close, even through tough times, you saw it Caesars, the operations still continued, life went on, maybe the ownerships kind of changed hands, but this stuff is about as bulletproof as it gets and I\u2019m not going to live when I say, because there\u2019s always some surprise, maybe in the future will appear, but I think this demonstrates perfectly, how rock solid the income coming out of not just us, but our gaming partners, gaming REIT partners really is."

            "Hey guys, how are you, and Steve, congratulations. guys, I know this is going to be hard to answer, but it was recently obviously in the paper earlier this week, kind of the Tropicana is beneficially listed and could you talk a little bit about in the couple of months now, since the transaction the way, maybe, your thinking has evolved, as it pertains to potentially, working with somebody in some form of mixed use versus an outright sale of the property versus kind of any other agenda you could potentially have at this point?"

      },
      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, there\u2019s an easy answer to that, and that is that as things settle out and they\u2019re certainly not settled in Las Vegas right now, it\u2019s hard to guess. We\u2019ll do whatever makes economic sense for this company. We\u2019ll look at every opportunity, all opportunities, partial sale, partial sale lease about grand leases. I mean, you can go through a litany of things that we\u2019re open to, and even though we\u2019re having some discussions, albeit \u2013 early, that will lead us to the right answer. I think the key is, we have a valuable piece of real estate in Las Vegas and we got fairly priced. We feel very confident about that. And as this evolves, we\u2019re just going to try to maximize value for all of us here and for you."

      },
      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And Carla, just to amplify on Peter\u2019s point, I would make it clear that these 35.1 acres are strip frontage, others talk about strip proximate. There\u2019s nothing proximate about being on the corner of Las Vegas, Boulevard and Tropicana, Boulevard. This is the corner of main and main and you know everything that\u2019s going on down there with respect to the stadium opening and everything else. So, it\u2019s really a matter of being patient letting Las Vegas come back to some feeling of normalization. But in spite of that, to Peter\u2019s point, there have been folks that have been making inquiries, because this has been an ongoing process and in spite of the Las Vegas Review-Journal, just sort of suggesting it\u2019s just been listed. We stepped into Penn\u2019s shoes in this process and they had started this process well over a year, year and a half ago. So, it is something that will continue and to Peter\u2019s point with the goal being maximizing value for GLPI."

         "Remarks": [
            "Great, thank you both, guys. And then if I could, it\u2019s been a question that\u2019s come up for years in terms of your interests outside of the gaming space and it\u2019s \u2013 that would have been something that made a ton of sense, but in the current environment, where as some of the entertainment-related companies, maybe aren\u2019t seeing that the multiples that made the transactions a little bit more difficult from an accretion perspective in the past. Has there been any and some of that is as obvious as valid as the business models are very troubled at this point. but has there been any change in kind of your view of non-gaming related assets since the pandemic?"

      },
      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, it\u2019s Peter. as I had indicated earlier, look, we\u2019re happy to be in the space we\u2019re in and thankful, we\u2019re not in some other spaces right now, where people are hurting a whole lot more. So, but what you\u2019ve asked is does that open opportunity in some other sectors? Look, I think again, we have to wait to see how things settle out. It may create some opportunity for us, but again, the struggle has always been, and I said this when we started seven years ago, since we doing this show me a better business in the one we\u2019re in, show me a business that has the cash flow certainty that we have, and we\u2019re about to prove it, we\u2019re proving it now. So that\u2019s always been the struggle. When we\u2019re on the road, talking to investors and to all of you, it\u2019s really a matter of \u2013 we\u2019re trying to make the case. We are in a business. It is about as bulletproof as it can get. It\u2019s not about occupancy. It\u2019s not about tenants canceling. It\u2019s none of that can happen.",
            "So, we\u2019re looking something may well emerge. I mean, I\u2019ve always said, I used to say on the Penn side, if it\u2019s alive and breathing, you can imagine we\u2019re looking at it. I mean, that\u2019s still was kind of our philosophy, but we\u2019re going to be patient. We\u2019re going to see what may change and we\u2019re looking to the future growth of this company. But again, prudence caution, remembering who we are staying close to the \u2013 to our core value of safety for shareholders isn\u2019t going to change. So, we\u2019ll see \u2013 we will see. you may well have a good observation that this is going to open up something for us. And if so, we hope to identify it."

It may take though a lot longer than we ever would have imagined. In the meantime, I think companies were already working, certainly Penn National was and everybody else as well on improving margins.",

I mean, right now, we\u2019re kind of the only game in town, I think in terms of entertainment and things that people can do and get out and \u2013 but I think there has been a permanent shift, companies are going to operate more profitably and we\u2019ll have to wait and see what the net result of that is.

So, it\u2019s great for you to take the time to drill down into heavy drilling. in terms of yet the escalators, clearly, as Peter mentioned, we do expect to see permanent margin improvements in these businesses, which will drive four-wall coverages, so that there is the ability to realize escalators. But I think the bottom line is look at the amendments that we\u2019ve made with new Caesars under the Tropicana lease and see what is in those amendments that drive known future same-store sales growth in the form of escalators. And those are the kinds of things to look for on a go-forward basis in my mind from GLPI, just to be specific with respect to your question."

It\u2019s pretty exciting. I\u2019d like to see that through there\u2019s some other things happening in Baton Rouge that are actually very appealing. So, there is a real opportunity to do something good with that property. beyond that, I\u2019m not sure what happens, but I would like to see through assuming we get approval that in fact this month or in August coming. We get approval to move landside with a modest, but very attractive facility. The spend is going to be very cautious, but I\u2019ve seen plans. They\u2019re terrific.

And 16 years are the only game in town. If you look at regional properties and true regional properties or EBITDAs right now are growing in those kind of mid-to-high teens. what do you think like if we go out a month or two in the current environment sustains, what do you think career with that growth is going to be for regional properties?

            "good morning, Thomas. let me give you a couple of data points, because I know you\u2019re a data junkie. I\u2019m a data junkie. I\u2019m looking at our TRS properties earlier this week in July. I mean, our volumes in the two properties were up nearly 6% on a year-over-year basis. And our EBITDA is up over 30% on a year-over-year basis in those two properties. that does not feel sustainable. The issue really is where does the world normalize when we get to the other side of this whole COVID-19 situation and there\u2019s still a risk, because you got 50 governors out there. Of course, only 16 of them affect us that you might see governors roll things back as they\u2019re starting to do. But I think we, as an industry, have proven our ability to provide adequate social distancing. We and our regulators have enforced mandatory masks for anyone coming on our gaming properties and those are the things that have allowed us to realize the performance that we\u2019ve realized in our taxable REIT subsidiary and our operating partners are realizing in the facilities that they operate, which we own. So, it\u2019s too early to tell, it is really the bottom line. I think to Peter\u2019s point, I don\u2019t know about the volumes, because again, these are capacity limited, and yet we\u2019re doing these upticks that I mentioned. but I do think, and others have said Boyd, on their call, we\u2019ve heard from Caesars \u2013 new Caesars in their update. And we\u2019ll hear from Penn next week. I think operating expenses have permanently been taken out of these businesses. And that\u2019s where the margin improvements will come from and that\u2019s what I think will drive the four wall coverage improvements that these facilities will see in the not-too-distant future once we anniversary this."

They were committed to still a margin improvement program that has been well-publicized. And then you put all this together, I think you\u2019re going to see that all businesses, certainly in the regional sector, are going to be able to operate a lot more leanly than they ever did before. So, we know it\u2019s going to be better, just don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to settle out as Steve said. We\u2019ve just got to have to wait and see. but look, this \u2013 we\u2019re thrilled with the early results."

And these data points adjust from Perryville, Maryland and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. So, don\u2019t extrapolate these globally. And we\u2019re also seeing a much higher participation by \u2013 from unrated play. We\u2019re just seeing much more unrated play, because remember, we have not marketed aggressively, because of capacity limitations. We\u2019ve been fortunate. But Louisiana has provided $5 million in annual tax free promotional credits. One of the reliefs that they\u2019ve provided the industry as a result of this whole COVID-19 situation. So, it just went into a fact. So, these things are still playing out. but generally younger demographic, more midweek, midday business than we\u2019re accustomed to seeing greater unrated play and higher spend per visit at a high level or the demographics that we\u2019re seeing."

Some states are going to be completely bricks and mortar oriented. There\u2019s a potential that in some places like, I guess in Washington D.C., or I understand that Michigan maybe, he was talking about anybody in his \u2013 their kids can get a license to do this.

We\u2019re certainly engaged though and in dialogue and we make those suggestions all the time, because not only do you get some balance sheet arbitrage, but you also get the permanency of capital that we talked about, which can ultimately lead to higher values for the companies.

Going forward, if you look at the pieces of what we\u2019re looking for, a strong operator, a strong asset and credit support to strong four-wall coverage and counterparty balance sheet, the ability to access capital, that last piece of the puzzle is obviously more important than it has been for a long time.

But the math is the math that you can see we\u2019ve got efficient or at least effective capital markets that are functioning.

And that historically has been the problem in regional gaming, whether it\u2019s in Atlantic City or the Gulf Coast or different regions around the country, there\u2019s always been a race to the bottom at times. I shouldn\u2019t say always. There have at times been sort of a race to the bottom in terms of giving away business to drive unprofitable business, quite frankly. Where I personally, and I\u2019m sure Peter and others around the table get their comfort is this industry has been vastly consolidated over the years. This industry is now dominated by large publicly traded companies. The presence in the industry of the data analytics capabilities have improved dramatically in recent years. And I think, and I hope you would agree any conference call that you listen to, whether it\u2019s Keith and Josh with Boyd or Tom and Brad at Eldorado or Jay and his team at Penn they are very focused on profitability.",
            "You\u2019re correct.

I know through our time at Penn and there were years ago back, historically since industry came regional in the early 90s, there were a lot of places where competitors were blowing their brains out. Those days are over. And I recall when I was running Penn on a day to day basis that, we had a discipline around that. We just simply said, let them go, let them go. We\u2019ll move some business in the meantime, they\u2019ll all come back. So, we always had a very strong discipline. I am a 100% certain that each of the companies we\u2019re talking about now has a much more sophisticated view of markets, values of customers and so forth.",

It could happen on property to property basis in a certain city or town that they put the buffet back as you illustrated. And maybe a GM will decide that that is necessary. But I think there\u2019s a lot more discipline in the industry today. And certainly this whole COVID mess has shown companies that they can operate very profitably with less. So, I\u2019m not overly worried that it\u2019s going to quickly flush away all the games that have been made."

I think you\u2019ve kind of addressed of sports betting and OTBs earlier in a prior question, but as we look to economic cycles, casinos have been large taxpayers and job creators for state governments. So the direct question is, as you look ahead, where do you see the appetite from state governments and regulators to look to casinos again? And what do you think that appetite for casino developers in your old role would be kind of going forward? Here is there\u2019s some opportunities left is our appetite, what\u2019s your just kind of overall outlook on, could we see another wave of development on the other side of the pandemic?"

            "It\u2019s, \u2013 look, if you\u2019re looking at existing States, sometimes there are constitutional limits on how many properties can be there. Some, there are certainly legislative limits, but look, there have been States that may change our own state here in Pennsylvania has done some, I call dumb things, frankly. And I don\u2019t mind putting that in print, but the industry still will flourish and is strong and so forth. You may see things on the market, and you see what\u2019s going on in Illinois. There always something odd going on in that State. I look, I think there\u2019s development potential. I hope somewhere in my lifetime, you see Georgia come around because it\u2019s a great opportunity. We\u2019d like to be there and be part of anything would happen there.",
            "And by the way, we\u2019ll look at new opportunities ourselves, partner with others, or even directly, if we had to be a competitor to put a stake in the ground and make sure we\u2019re in any new \u2013 in any new market taxes I hope in my lifetime. Finally comes around to allowing gaming in that state and not giving the money away to Oklahoma and to Louisiana and so forth, no criticism of either of those States, but leaving a vast amount of dollars on the table. So, I hope someday that\u2019s going to happen. So, I think you\u2019re going to see, there are some major markets it\u2019s still are open and we\u2019ve seen it everywhere, right? Sooner or later, they\u2019re all going get there. Two existing States, yes, you could see some things on the fringe that would occur, maybe opportunity, maybe opportunity. It\u2019s hard to \u2013 it\u2019s kind of hard to know anybody else want to add to that? I mean, now we\u2019re talking crystal ball stuff."

            "Yes John \u2013 talked about this, obviously over the years. I mean, we consciously looked at the environment when we spun the real estate out. There aren\u2019t too many States left, whether it\u2019s because of the incumbents that obviously lobby against because of tribal interests that lobby against, or in the case of Texas because of conservative interests that lobby against it is a very difficult task to go from no commercial casinos to allowing commercial casinos. That being said, obviously, markets like Arkansas and Virginia are developing new casinos at this point in time. So there will always be some limited opportunities, but I think the big opportunities for better or for worse are behind us."

I mean, you\u2019ve got to States that have to balance their budgets in the short term, the immediacy of the cash flows for them. If you look at casinos, it isn\u2019t the top of the hierarchy, right? There\u2019s a lot of other things they can do that can generate revenue more quickly, especially when you look at the timeline in Massachusetts, from the enablement legislation to when things actually got, got developed in the cash flow into the state. I mean there\u2019s multiple years in between there."

And I can\u2019t, since I hadn\u2019t planned to say this, but I don\u2019t mind saying it in front of Steve, much of the success that this company is built on, of course comes from our years at Ben and no one had a greater influence on the success of that company than Steve Snyder.
