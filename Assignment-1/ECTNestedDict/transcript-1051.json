      "Greg Hayes": [
         "Thanks, Kelsey, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m on slide two of the webcast here. Let me just begin by providing an update on some of the current priorities and highlights of Q2. As everyone knows, these last several months have been incredibly challenging. However, we remain focused on supporting our key stakeholders and that starts with ensuring the health and safety of all of our employees. That is our number one priority.",
         "We also remain committed to delivering for our customers across commercial aerospace and defense. On the defense side, that means providing our customers with mission critical products and services in the U.S. and internationally.",
         "On the commercial aero side, that means supporting customers during this very difficult time to make sure that planes fly safely, especially as airlines begin to ramp up capacity again. We also continue to engage with our suppliers ensuring that they have the support needed to maintain stability while also working with them to make their processes more efficient.",
         "Just a word on the merger, now we\u2019re just about 100 days into this and I would tell you that we remain focused on the integration across the organization and on delivering our cost and revenue synergies.",
         "While we created Raytheon Technologies during a pandemic that is causing -- it\u2019s causing every company to work in new ways, I would tell you that the integration is progressing remarkably well.",
         "There was, of course, significant planning underway before the pandemic and the two teams have come together seamlessly to figure out how we can operate more productively as an organization and how to better serve our customers.",
         "I\u2019m encouraged by what we\u2019ve accomplished to-date and I\u2019m alluding confident in our ability to deliver on our synergy targets, which is over $1 billion in gross savings. Also, it\u2019s important to note that our liquidity position and balance sheet remain very strong, and of course, we remain committed to the dividend.",
         "At the end of the second quarter, we had over $7 billion in cash and ample financial flexibility and this before the approximately $2 billion in net proceeds from the previously announced divestitures, the remaining two of which are expected to close before the end of the third quarter.",
         "At the same time, of course, we remain laser focused on those things that we can control. That is cost and that is cash. And we\u2019re on track to achieve $2 billion in cost savings this year and $4 billion in cash conservation actions by the end of the year. This, of course, is focused on our commercial aero businesses.",
         "The good news is, we\u2019ve already completed nearly 30% or seen about $600 million in savings in Q2, and our cost actions -- of our cost actions and about $1 billion of cash conservation or 25% of our target there. That\u2019s of course better than we expected. Until we\u2019ll give you more color on the expected cadence of these actions for the rest of the year, it really a kudos to the team on the commercial aero side for their decisive actions and getting after all this.",
         "Overall, while the pandemic continues to deeply impact our commercial aero business, our balanced portfolio includes a resilient defense business that will help us offset near-term commercial arrow headwinds.",
         "Wherever the effects of the pandemic on the economy and commercial aerospace has proven to be a lot worse than what we originally projected even a few months ago. And for that reason, we now would expect it will take at least until 2023 for commercial air traffic to recover to 2019 levels.",
         "As a result, we are evaluating what further actions and structural changes we need to make to our business to adjust for a prolonged recovery timeline. And we\u2019ll be back later this year with some more details on that. These are difficult actions but ones that are necessary to preserve our financial strength. So we\u2019re focused on what we can control and proactively manage and we\u2019re going to wait for the upside to come and it will.",
         "Moving to the right side of the page, Raytheon Technologies has several notable highlights in the quarter. It was previously announced, our missiles and defense business was selected by the U.S. Air Force to develop the long range standoff weapon or LRSO. The new franchise has a lifetime value over $10 billion. And in June, the missiles and defense business also booked a $2.3 billion award for the TPY-2 Radars for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. These are significant franchises that will fuel our defense growth over the next several years and beyond.",
         "On the commercial aero side, the demand environment was weak as expected, but we did achieve some milestones in the quarter. We continue to support airlines in the industry and efforts to promote safe and healthy flying.",
         "At Collins, which is an innovative company in their DNA, they\u2019re working with airline customers and across industry forums to develop solutions for enhanced aircraft and airport sanitation. We\u2019ll look at ways to enhance contactless travel with biometrics and health monitoring. And we filed nearly 100 ideas for provisional patents associated with these technologies. We expect these solutions to start entering service in the back half of the year and they highlight how Collins aerospace is poised to help the industry move forward well into the future.",
         "At Pratt, we announced the China Express Airlines has taken delivery of its first GTF powered A-320 NEO aircraft. That brings our total fleet to a milestone of 50 aircraft with 28 more A-320 aircraft on order.",
         "As I said before, we\u2019re on track to deliver on over $1 billion of gross run rate synergies by 2024, we\u2019ve already completed the consolidation of the legacy Raytheon segments from four into two and the corporate restructuring is well underway.",
         "We have more than 500 synergy projects that we\u2019ve identified and have re-matured [ph]. And remember this is on top of the Rockwell Collins synergies. You recall we had $600 million of synergies targeted we\u2019ve achieved $300 million already.",
         "We\u2019ve got another $30 million in this quarter and $90 million year-to-date. So we\u2019re well on our way to achieving that goal. I think, importantly, that we\u2019ve also booked about $300 million -- $350 million of revenue synergies at Collins since the acquisition in late 2018.",
         "Toby will take us through the second quarter results, but given the uncertainties which still exists surrounding the pandemics and its effects, we will not provide a traditional outlook today. But Toby will give you some color and how we\u2019re thinking about the rest of the year.",
         "So, with that, let me turn it over to Toby.",
         "Okay. Thanks, Toby. We\u2019re on slide 10 now and maybe just a couple of points. I think, obviously, a lot going on in the quarter, a lot of uncertainty out there. I think, just to be clear on a couple of things.",
         "While there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, we\u2019re going to remain focused on supporting our employees, our customers and our suppliers. This includes ensuring the health and safety of our workforce, first and foremost. But also delivering advanced technologies and innovative products for our customers and working with our suppliers to maintain the stability of the supply chain.",
         "I guess, it\u2019s important to remember, in the quarter, we still invested $500 million in A&D on a commercial aero side. This isn\u2019t [ph] important as we think about the long-term. We\u2019re not going to sacrifice long-term for short-term. We\u2019re going to take some tough cost actions. We\u2019re going to do what we need to do but we\u2019re going to continue to invest for the future. And of course, we\u2019re going to continue to execute on the integration of the merger and the Rockwell acquisition, as Toby said, and we\u2019ve got a clear path to meet or exceed those expected synergies.",
         "Also, I think, it is important to remember, we\u2019re going to remain disciplined with our capital, ensuring that we maintain financial flexibility, while prioritizing capital areas that will maximize value for our customers and shareowners. Despite all the uncertainty out there, we still remain committed to return $18 billion to $20 billion of cash to our shareholders in the first four years after this merger.",
         "As I said, we\u2019re also taking a hard look at the businesses given the environment and the prolonged recovery, and we\u2019re going to take additional actions as we think is -- are appropriate. We will be nimble. We\u2019re going to remain focused on what we can control and we\u2019re going to adapt to the current environment and position our commercial aero businesses for growth, while also maintaining solid growth on the defense portfolio.",
         "Overall, the opportunities and furloughs remain significant and I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to emerge from this crisis in a position of strength and deliver sustainable long-term value for our customers, for employees, our shareholders.",
         "So, with that, Ursula, let\u2019s open it up to questions. Thanks everyone."

         "Good morning. And welcome to the Raytheon Technologies second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me on the call today are Greg Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Toby O\u2019Brien, our Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Mitchell, Corporate Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations.",
         "This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available for download from Raytheon Technologies\u2019 website at www.rtx.com.",
         "Please note except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding net non-recurring and/or significant items and acquisition accounting adjustments, often referred to by management as other significant items.",
         "The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. RTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.",
         "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.",
         "With that, I will turn the call over to Greg."

      "Neil Mitchell": [
         "Thank you, Toby. Starting with Collins Aerospace on slide five. Adjusted sales were $4.3 billion in the quarter, down 36% on an organic basis and down 35% on an adjusted basis, driven primarily by the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on the aerospace industry.",
         "Commercial OEM sales were down 53% driven by lower volume across all platforms, including the continued 737 Max grounding and anticipated declines in legacy programs. Commercial aftermarket sales were down 48%, driven by a 45% decline in parts and repair, a 57% decline in provisioning and a 45% decline in modifications and upgrades.",
         "Partially offsetting the headwinds in the commercial channels, military sales were up 10%, driven by strength across key platforms and product lines, including higher F-35 volume. We also saw growth on development contracts in the quarter.",
         "Adjusted operating profit of $24 million was down $1.3 billion from prior year, dropped through on higher military sales, aggressive cost management actions including lower A&D and continued synergy capture were more than offset by lower commercial OEM and aftermarket sales and fixed cost headwinds.",
         "Shifting to Pratt & Whitney on slide six. Adjusted sales of $3.6 billion were down 32% on an organic basis and down 30% on an adjusted basis, also driven primarily by the pandemic\u2019s impact on OEMs and operators.",
         "Commercial OEM sales were down 42% driven by lower deliveries across Pratt\u2019s large commercial engine and Pratt Canada platforms, with the exception of the PW800, which saw slight growth in the quarter.",
         "Commercial aftermarket sales were down 51% in the quarter, growth in the GTF aftermarket was more than offset by the impact of a 64% reduction in legacy large commercial engine shop visit inductions and an approximate 40% reduction in Pratt Canada shop visit.",
         "Ramping JSF production continues to drive sales growth at Pratt\u2019s military business. Military sales were up 11% due to higher aftermarket sales across key platforms and increased F-35 production volume.",
         "Adjusted operating profit of a loss of $151 million was down $603 million from the prior year. Significant aftermarket volume reductions, fixed cost headwinds and unfavorable military contract adjustments more than offset drop through on higher military sales, cost mitigation actions and slightly lower negative engine margin.",
         "Turning now to slide seven. RIS reported sales were $3.3 billion, pro forma sales, including the four days stub period were $3.5 billion. Sales were primary impacted by expected declines in the Warfighter FOCUS program, which represented a little over 4 points of sales headwind and that was partially offset by higher airborne system sales and broad growth across other RIS programs.",
         "As a reminder, all legacy Raytheon company long-term contracts were reset to zero percent complete on the merger, which is impacting both sales and operating profit. So adjusting the prior year sales to remove the favorable productivity impact of EACs and the current year sales to include the stub period, RIS sales grew 1% in the second quarter.",
         "Reported operating profit was $311 million, adjusting the prior year to remove the favorable productivity impact of EACs and the current year include the stub period, RIS operating profit growth was up approximately 4% in the second quarter. Of note, RIS had over $1.4 billion of classified bookings in the quarter. RIS also $166 million for the Global ASNT program for the U.S. Air Force, and as Toby mentioned, had a strong book-to-bill ratio in the quarter.",
         "Turning now to slide eight, RMD reported sales were $3.6 billion. Pro forma sales, including the four days stub period were $3.8 billion. Sales benefited from growth on an international air and missile defense system program in the second quarter.",
         "Adjusting the prior year sales to remove the favorability and productivity impact of EACs and the current year sales to include the stub period, RMD sales grew almost 3% in the second quarter.",
         "Reported operating profit was $397 million. Adjusting the prior year to remove the favorable productivity impact of EACs and the current year to include the stub period, RMD operating profit was up approximately 4% in the second quarter.",
         "In addition to the awards Greg highlighted, RMD also booked approximately $300 million for the Standard Missile-3 with the MDA and an international customer in the quarter. And as Toby mentioned, RMD also had a strong book-to-bill ratio in the quarter.",
         "So let me turn it back to Toby."

      "Operator": [
         "Good day ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Raytheon Technologies Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ursula, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.",
         "I would now like to turn the call over Ms. Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed."
      ],
      "Toby O\u2019Brien": [
         "Okay. Thanks, Greg. I\u2019m on slide three. As Greg mentioned, no surprise, Q2 was a challenging quarter. Before going through the second quarter results, it\u2019s worth noting that since the merger completed on April 3rd, our second quarter results include legacy Raytheon company from that point forward.",
         "Adjusted sales were $14.3 billion and better than our expectations due to better volume at Collins, Pratt and RMD. Adjusted EPS was $0.40, also better than our expectations driven by accelerated progress on our cost mitigation actions in the quarter favorable volume primarily at Collins and RMD, and the adjustment for certain charges driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the industry and economy.",
         "On a GAAP basis EPS from continuing operations was a loss of $2.56 per share, down year-over-year, which included $2.96 of net non-recurring and/or significant items, and acquisition accounting adjustments. Of which $2.34 was related to charges due to the current economic environment, primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the largest piece being $2.13 related to an impairment of Collins Aerospace goodwill and intangibles, and the remainder attributable to customer bankruptcies and collection risk, and contract charges from anticipated lower future flight utilization.",
         "The other $0.62 consists principally of $0.28 of acquisition accounting adjustments, primarily related to intangible amortization, $0.21 of restructuring and $0.04 of merger and integration related expenses.",
         "Free cash flow was better than expected at an outflow of $248 million, including $165 million of merger cost and restructuring. The better than expected cash flow was driven primarily by the timing of advances and collections, as well as accelerated progress on our announced cash mitigation actions including inventory reduction at Collins.",
         "Moving on to slide four. While the second quarter was as challenging as expected, we continue to see a number of trends that confirm the resiliency of our balanced portfolio. Our defense backlog was up versus the first quarter and grew to a new record of $73.1 billion. RIS had a book-to-bill ratio in the quarter of 1.17 and RMD of 1.22, giving us a consolidated RIS and RMD book-to-bill ratio of 1.2.",
         "Collins Military and Pratt Military also had strong sales growth in the quarter, growing 10% and 11%, respectively. Positive news that our franchises are healthy and will support solid growth in our defense portfolio for the next few years.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Neil to take you through the segment results and I\u2019ll come back and share a bit more perspective on the rest of the year.",
         "Thanks, Neil. I\u2019m on slide nine now. As you know, there are a number of factors, some headwinds, some tail winds and the number of unknowns affecting the macro environment and our business going forward.",
         "Let\u2019s start with the positives. Military program growth remains robust, both domestically and internationally, and is contributing to our strong defense sales growth and a record defense backlog, nothing really changing here from our previous expectations.",
         "We also continue to execute on important actions to position the business for long-term value creation. Our merger synergies are progressing well and we remain on track to deliver nearly $200 million of gross RTX synergies and an incremental $150 million of Rockwell Collins acquisition cost synergies this year, which will bring the total for Rockwell to $450 million of our $600 million target.",
         "We are also on track to deliver our previously discussed $2 billion of cost savings and $4 billion of cash conservation actions in 2020 and we will continue to manage the business proactively to respond to the current and developing environment.",
         "We now expect to realize approximately 30% of our announced cost actions in Q3 and approximately 40% in Q4. This is after we already achieved around 30% of our cost actions in Q2. And as Greg highlighted, our liquidity position remains very strong and we have ample financial flexibility.",
         "It\u2019s no surprise, however, that given COVID-19, the overall macro environment and commercial air traffic in particular are significant unknowns. We are tracking air travel trends across the globe on a daily basis. While they are generally improving, recovery is slow, and while we continue to monitor these trends, as Greg said, we now see the recovery being protracted over several years at least through 2023.",
         "We also continue to monitor the financial condition of global airlines and the health of the supply chain. Given the significance of these factors on our business, there continues to be too much uncertainty to provide an outlook. But let me tell you, how we\u2019re thinking about the second half of the year.",
         "Let\u2019s start with Collins. We continue to see commercial OE sales down in line with OEM production levels and aircraft delivery schedules. Generally consistent with the decline we saw in Q2.",
         "We see Collins commercial aftermarket sales down in line with expected RPM declines and the impact of the ADSB mandate headwinds. Where we expect Q3 sales will largely be in line with Q2 plus or minus and expect to see a gradual recovery in Q4.",
         "For Pratt, we continue to see commercial OE sales in line with our main OEM customers, similar to what we saw in Q2. Well, GTF overhaul activity continues as we upgrade to the latest configuration, we expect Pratt\u2019s aftermarket sales to be down given the more than 50% decline in legacy shop visits.",
         "We still expect that Pratt Canada will be down in the back half of the year, but not as severely as the large commercial engine business due to the differences in their end markets with business jet and general aviation markets showing better recovery.",
         "Moving to the military portion of Collins and Pratt, we continue to see strength in military sales and still expect to see mid single-digit growth, excluding the impact of the two pending Collins divestitures. So, again, no change here. I will also note, there aren\u2019t any changes to the RIS or RMD sales or adjusted operating profit outlooks that we gave on our first quarter call.",
         "As we think about what this means for our business as a whole, we continue to think Q2 will likely be the lowest quarterly sales and EPS in 2020. Looking at sales in the back half of the year, we would expect sequential sales improvement, modest in Q3 and then better Q4.",
         "For EPS, we would expect Q3 to generally be in line with Q2 with some puts and takes, and then a gradual recovery beginning in Q4, as demand begins to return and more of our cost actions are realized.",
         "A couple of other items to keep in mind for the second half of the year, as we have discussed, we\u2019ve implemented significant COVID protocols across our businesses and are incurring a number of incremental expenditures associated with the pandemic, including enhanced facility cleaning, employee temperature scanning, higher freight cost and other COVID related in efficiencies. We expect around $0.08 of EPS headwind related to these costs for the rest of the year. More than initially expected, bringing the full year total cost to approximately $0.16 of a headwind.",
         "For free cash flow, we still expect pro forma 2020 free cash flow for the full year of roughly $2 billion. This includes an outflow of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for merger cost restructuring and cash taxes on dispositions as we have previously discussed.",
         "As we think about our cash actions, we still expect to realize the majority of the benefit in the back half of the year, with approximately 30% of our cash actions in Q3 and approximately 45% in Q4.",
         "In summary, we expect the rest of the year to be challenging for our commercial aerospace segments, but continue to expect good growth from our defense businesses and we\u2019re positioning the company for a strong recovery.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Greg to wrap things up."

            "Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you. I guess Greg or Toby, your biggest diva driver Collins declined 98% year-over-year, yet free cash flow was essentially breakeven. So can you maybe talk about free cash flow trends in aero or commercial? And what you\u2019re seeing in terms of working capital and cost savings. Toby, you mentioned is, running at 30% ahead of your 10% target, so any thoughts on those moving pieces and how it relates to free cash flow in 2020 and going forward?"

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. So, I\u2019ll take the last part of that first, Sheila, that, the $2 billion of cost actions, $4 billion of cash preservation conservation actions are assumed and they were assumed back in Q1 and the $2 billion for the year. The good news is, we\u2019re seeing accelerated execution on those and realization. Obviously, that helps to derisk the back half of the year.",
            "In the quarter, obviously, the drop through of 30% versus we\u2019d expected about 10%, that 20% incremental improvement helps cash flow at both Pratt and Collins. So that was a good guy in the quarter compared to our expectations.",
            "And I believe that both Pratt and Collins are also doing a really good job of managing their inventory. I think Collins held it flat through the first part of the quarter and actually saw a little bit of a reduction as we move through to the end of June, which contributed to some of the favorability of the Q2 cash flow there. So things are on or ahead of schedule, but again, really timing related relative to the work, the Pratt and the Collins teams have done to accelerate those actions.",
            "And the other thing I\u2019d throw in there, we saw real strong collections from a cash flow point of view on some large international collections at RMD, not the commercial aero side of the house but RMD that favorably impacted Q2 and those were expected in the back half of the year as well."

            "Hi, Sheila. It\u2019s Greg. Just to highlight just a couple of things. Again, we\u2019ve got $1 billion of cash actions in the first quarter. And that was without or second quarter rather -- that\u2019s without really impacting our inventories. Yet, we\u2019re really just starting to see the benefits of inventory reduction in the supply chain.",
            "If you think about the -- by the fourth quarter, we would expect probably a $0.5 billion of tailwind from reduced material inputs. You\u2019re also going to see a ramp up in savings from headcount actions.",
            "Again, about half of this cost savings in the first quarter -- second quarter were headcount related, that number is going to almost double by the end of the year. So, again, we\u2019re taking the actions and we\u2019re really confident we\u2019re going to see these improvements throughout the rest of the year."

Basically, we seem 2Q airline activity if you are at RPMs or ASMs down a huge number, 80% or 90% and your aftermarkets, I think, down around 50%. What\u2019s the risk that aftermarket could actually get worse from here, given this disconnect between the revenues you\u2019ve seen and what the airlines have seen in 2Q?"

We think it\u2019s the total flights are down about 50% and so well air passenger traffic is down 80%, which is better than the 95% it was. There\u2019s still planes out there flying around and around, again down 50%. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re basing the outlook on.",
            "Obviously, as we think about the pieces of the aftermarket, some pieces are more impacted. If I think about spare parts for instance at Collins Aerospace, which is a key driver of profitability, that was down almost 75% in the quarter. Repair was down like 55%.",
            "The forecast, Toby, was talking about for the back half of the year, assumes a modest recovery, picking up in Q4 and I think that\u2019s the key as we think about the back half of the year is, will we see that modest recovery, and again, the recovery is going to take several years. But right now it\u2019s hard to imagine, probably, getting anything worse than what we saw in Q2, assuming, again, this -- we still see about 50% of the current aircraft flying out there."

Those are furloughs -- for those of -- us at the corporate office there\u2019s a 10% furlough or 10% salary reduction with deferred merit. Some of those costs will come back. I think it\u2019s important to note, the commercial aerospace reduced to about 8,000 positions. Some of those will come back with volume. Some of them will be permanently reduced.",
            "And one of the things that I\u2019m really focused on right now as we think about a recovery that may well take into 2023 is we need to take a look at some of the more structural costs that we have in our aerospace organization. That is cost in some high cost manufacturing locations. What can we get after to restructure those businesses later this year? So we\u2019ll come back. The guys are looking at it and it\u2019s going to be some tough things to do, but I think this is the opportunity to alter the overhead structure of the commercial arrow businesses.

So we\u2019re -- I won\u2019t give you any specifics on any individual customer, but I would just say, we\u2019re trying to be as flexible as we can with payment terms and with cash flow.

Can you talk about kind of how that breaks down between, manufacturer production rates being down, the Max impact and any sort of stocking you\u2019re seeing? And then, Greg, maybe can you touch on the decrementals that we saw at Collins, I know Collins remain profitable, but the decrementals were pretty big.

Clearly, this should improve as we go through the quarter, especially as we take additional cost actions to take up some overhead, but the aftermarket is tough.",
            "I think if you think about the other issue that you\u2019ve got at Collins is, they have been disproportionately impacted by the slowdown of 737. Recall, we\u2019ve got about $2.5 million of content per 737. With the latest production schedule from Boeing on 737 with this kind of slow ramp in production, I doubt we\u2019ll be shipping any 737 related inventory, probably, until the next half of next year.",

There are about a point each of headwind going forward, pretty consistent with our prior expectations. And just piling on a little bit what Greg said about the decrementals, not inconsistent with what we had outline back at Q1. We said north of 50%, as Greg said, about 55% in the quarter, that\u2019s for overall, right, when you take into account, aftermarket would be greater effects of the absorption. We do expect that will improve a little bit as we move through the year and especially as the cost reduction actions take further hold.",

Again, pretty much as we expected, not as severe, because of course, they don\u2019t have margin on the large engine shipments from an OE point of view.

That is the plants that we have that aren\u2019t operating at full capacity. So, again, those decremental margins are all in.

We\u2019ve talked to every single one of our customers who\u2019s going to be taking GTF powered aircraft and I think we are fully aligned there. I mean, that\u2019s about a, as we would say, roughly a 40% reduction in GTF volume in the A-320s in the next year and a half here.

Obviously, we\u2019re working with Boeing to make sure that that happens.",

On top of that is, as Boeing has gone through and looked at the inventory levels that they have for all of our equipment. That\u2019s what really caused us to take a pause and say, you know what, we probably aren\u2019t going to be shipping much 737 hardware until the back half of 2021. So, again, that\u2019s really been the refinement, if you will, it\u2019s the inventory on hand, as well as a little bit slower ramp."

But as the quarter evolved, new information came to light, as we talked about, around the timing of recovery, pushing out to \u201823, more airline bankruptcies. And so, the reserve amounts and the EACs had a threshold where it was significant enough to be adjusted out of our earnings, given the magnitude and the unique nature of things.",

Because when you look at that you\u2019re talking $400 million in the aggregate, roughly $200 in each of the two segments. And then on top of that, you mentioned the bankruptcies, right, and I am probably off, but it was at least five in the quarter, right? So in normal periods of time, we\u2019re not looking at five bankruptcies in a quarter, right, if you go back to pre-COVID.",
