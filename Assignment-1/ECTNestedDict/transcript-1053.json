         "Thank you, Joanne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I have to say it\u2019s good to be back this quarter with a live call and have the opportunity to elaborate on the second quarter where we generated big free cash flow and reduced debt despite a challenging macro environment as well as have the opportunity to further discuss the very solid outlook we are presenting through 2021.",
         "First, allow me to quickly remind you that we may discuss forward-looking statements about our plans, expectations and assumptions regarding future performance. These statements involve risks that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements.",
         "Please refer to the cautionary information about forward-looking statements in the 2Q earnings release, the IR presentation and the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-Q, which was filed this morning, all of which are posted to our website. Our discussion today may include discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful in understanding and evaluating our performance.",
         "Reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other information about these non-GAAP metrics are provided in our earnings release and IR presentation. Here to answer your questions this morning, our CEO, Jay Ottoson; EVP and CFO, Wade Pursell; and President and COO, Herb Vogel.",

But you can assume something like double-digit growth from a production standpoint and even stronger when you\u2019re thinking of oil growth. So I would characterize it more like strong double-digit growth. And that\u2019s coming off of a reduced number this year, obviously, with what\u2019s going on in this quarter."

I think there\u2019s sometimes in these downturns people have a misunderstanding about levered companies, and we really don\u2019t have an option here to just stop activity and watch our leverage skyrocket, right? That\u2019s just not what you should expect a fairly levered company to do. So when prices drop, we cut activity very quickly in order to \u2013 and then as we think costs start to get to bottom, then we will increase activity again to keep our cash flows up and maintain our \u2013 and keep our leverage down. And that\u2019s what you should expect levered companies to do at \u2013 in this part of the cycle."

And in terms of rigs, it will be around 3%, maybe a little bit more in the Permian. And then in South Texas, it will be between 1% and 2%, and it will depend a little bit on where commodity prices are. And we haven\u2019t finalized our plans anyway. So we\u2019ve got multiple scenarios. It will depend on where \u2013 what the outlook is when we get to the end of the year."

And with our projected leverage next year and maintaining in that 3 times area, we think it\u2019s really important to protect the cash flow that supports that. So putting \u2013 we\u2019ve been \u2013 as oil kind of trended back up towards the 40 area \u2013 in the low 40s area, we\u2019ve been adding hedges swaps for next year. And a very similar program on the natural gas side. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the move up in the strip on the natural gas side. So we\u2019ve been adding hedges there as well. And all the details are in the appendix. You can see that. But that\u2019s our strategy. We don\u2019t go too far out because we know that with the recovery the cost will likely go up over a period of time as well. So we\u2019re just now starting to put in slivers, I\u2019ll call them hedges, in 2022."

I know you \u2013 it seems like you have something of a sweet spot but maybe is a little different geologically. So I was just wondering if you could talk about how the oil rates hold up over time? And if you do indeed see a rapid phase shift?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Brad, this is Herb. So first of all, we\u2019re super pleased with what our geoscience teams have come up with there on the Austin Chalk. As time\u2019s gone on, they\u2019ve really refined the landing zone. And that\u2019s really shown that we have higher permeability rock on our acreage than elsewhere. And so the productivity is high. And then you\u2019re correct that the phase that\u2019s produced varies over our acreage.",
            "To the Northwest, it\u2019s much oilier and less gas but NGL rich. And you move East and South, and it gets gassier. And it\u2019s like trends the same way the Eagle Ford except had a completely higher level of condensate and NGL than the Eagle Ford just because it\u2019s shallower. So yes, you\u2019ll \u2013 as we go East, it will be high productivity, and it\u2019ll just be gassier. And you can see that in those well results we gave with 58% oil over on the Northwest and 32% oil over more towards the Southeast. So in all cases, the NGL content is quite high."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, got it. Sorry, I maybe used the wrong language there. I was more talking about the productivity of the well over time. Do you see like a significantly more rapid oil decline than you see from the liquids and gas? Or is it sort of more steady in this area?"

         "Speaker": "Brad Heffern"
      },
      "24": {
         "Remarks": [
            "No. It\u2019s a transition from both oil to condensate through our acreage. And so the rates hang in there quite well. It\u2019s not like a Permian well that will decline relatively rapidly. We had wind up facility limited, so we can only produce so much so the gas stays on plateau for a while and the condensate stays up there with it and then it will decline over time. But yes, it\u2019s a different character of decline than what you\u2019d see from the Permian."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, great. Thanks. And just a couple of sort of administrative things on South Texas as well. So I know you guys have called out that in mid-2021 you have the transportation contracts rolling off. But the last couple of quarters, the transportation expense has been quite low relative to where it sort of used to hang out, at least on a nominal basis. So I was wondering if anything has changed there? And then also, you\u2019ve called out this $5 per barrel improvement index in 2021. Is that associated with like a new contract? Or what\u2019s the reason for that? Thanks."

      "26": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Yes, this is Herb again. So there\u2019s two parts to your question. Let me give the second one first. So on condensate, we have a contract that has a specific volume amount, and we will have fulfilled that contract sometime later in the year and then we\u2019ll re-up the contract. And currently, contract rates are quite a bit better than they were from that older contract. So that\u2019s benefit there.",
            "And then on the transportation cost, are you talking about our overall corporate transportation costs? Because that\u2019s simply \u2013 there\u2019s more of a mix weighted more towards the Permian, which has transportation cost of effectively zero. So if you take the transportation cost for South Texas, it will be blended down from additional Permian production and then there\u2019s an additional impact, and that\u2019s with the Austin Chalk, it\u2019s more liquids rich. So it\u2019s going to be a little bit lower transportation cost per BOE also."

      "27": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Yes. I was more looking at like just on a nominal basis, like typically, the transportation expense for South Texas is like $45 million a quarter or something like that, and it\u2019s gone down into sort of the mid-30s, but maybe the Austin Chalk is the explanation for that."

Now that prices are back up, I think in the revised plan now, you\u2019re talking about 68 wells completed for the year versus previously thinking around 77. So just your thoughts around that."

And if you combine South Texas, we\u2019ve actually dropped our total number of drills by 12 for the year and our number of completions by 26 for the year. And obviously, that\u2019s the extraordinary environment we encountered in March. And so we did what any company would do as we quickly reacted and put in a proactive plan in place to revise plans and optimize our cash flows to reach our objectives for 2020 as well as 2021. So we didn\u2019t do it just in isolation of one year. We looked longer-term in defining the new scenarios for the plan that we\u2019ll develop later in the year."

Can you just talk about what\u2019s your thoughts behind that? Is that \u2013 do you think that will lead to a better 2021 or \u2013 it\u2019s just definitely noticeable that you are definitely much more sort of equal weighted on spending this year than most of the other E&Ps out there."

And when March came around, we put in place a plan very quickly and that really cut our activity, and we wound up with curtailments in May and June. And so we really had a trough in CapEx spending in second and third quarter, and then we ramped up at the back end of fourth quarter and get into 2021, which, based on strip pricing, was the optimal way to work our way through this unprecedented event."

So obviously, we build our DUC count through this year at a kind of slow pace. And then as we go into next year, the way we would do this is we pull down the DUC count and that will be just kind of getting more to natural levels by the end of 2021. And we don\u2019t have a plan for 2021. So I can\u2019t give a specific DUC count right now for where we see it, but that\u2019s something we\u2019d share later in the year."

But when we look at kind of a normalized LOE rate, where are you today in the Permian versus two quarters ago? And what have you really done to drive that LOE lower?"

            "Okay. Gail, this is Herb. You\u2019re right. Our LOEs come down significantly, and there was a component that was less workover expense. Obviously, it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend much on workovers when prices were where they were in the second quarter. So unilaterally, across the board, we wind up with lower service costs at our LOE expenses. And we\u2019ve aggressively contracted for lower expenses. That\u2019s the main driver. And then we\u2019ve also optimized things like use of compression and use of generators that also reduced costs. So it\u2019s pretty much across all LOE categories that we\u2019ve reduced cost."

I think that uses like a $2 \u2013 or $2.40 gas environment. I was just kind of curious, if gas is $3, how does that change the oil breakeven for the Austin Chalk?"

That amount is actually in excess of the \u2013 of what is coming due in 2021 and 2022. And then you know there\u2019s nothing in 2023, no bonds mature. So multiple options. We\u2019ll be opportunistic and try to look at the lowest cost alternative for retiring those."
