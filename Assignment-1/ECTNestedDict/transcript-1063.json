         "Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As of June 30, the company had $378 million of funds available under our revolving credit facilities and a conservative leverage position with a debt to total asset ratio of 27%. We anticipate maintaining a similar level of liquidity throughout the remainder of 2020. Our continued focus to maintain a strong balance sheet and allocate capital prudently has provided us with the flexibility to manage our business effectively during this time. As it relates to COVID and the direct impact on our financial results, except for a basin or ski hill in Colorado, results for the quarter were not materially impacted by the ongoing pandemic.",
         "In response to government-mandated closures, a basin was required to close for mid-March through May, resulting in a $5.8 million decline in NOI quarter-over-quarter. Some of our active development projects were required to temporarily cease construction due to government-mandated closures. However, they have also reopened, and we experienced minimal delays from a scheduling perspective.",
         "We continue to work with our retail and commercial tenants on a case-by-case basis, providing temporary rent deferrals and by participating in CECRA, the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program, CECRA provides qualifying small businesses, a 75% rent abatement to tenants, of which one-third is absorbed by the landlord and two-third is paid by CMHC. Overall, the rent abatement provided to our qualifying tenants did not have a significant impact to our results for the quarter. Across our consolidated results, Dream\u2019s average monthly rent collection in the second quarter exceeded 88%. In the second quarter, we\u2019ve successfully closed on the sale of our indirect interest in the renewable power portfolio, generating pretax earnings of $34 million for during net of transaction costs as well as $70 million in gross cash proceeds, which were received subsequent to period end.",
         "The company also completed the refinancing of the distillery district, our 395,000 square foot retail site in downtown Toronto, which provided an additional $42 million of liquidity for Dream. Earnings before income taxes after adjusting for fair value gains and losses taken on Dream Alternatives units held by other unitholders for the second quarter was $28 million, an increase of $3.7 million relative to the prior year. The increase was driven by earnings from the renewable power sale and lower interest costs, partially offset by the timing of development completion within certain equity-accounted investments, reduced earnings from a basin and Dream Alternatives investment portfolio and certain fair value losses recognized on our investment properties in the period.",
         "In terms of results by our operating segments, in Q2, our recurring income segment generated revenue and net operating income of $19.8 million and $4.2 million respectively, compared to $42.5 million and $21.8 million in the prior period. The decrease was driven by the temporary closure of a basin and reduced income from Dream Alternatives portfolio due to prior year asset dispositions and loan repayments in line with the Trust\u2019s strategic plan.",
         "Results for the second quarter include fair value losses on investment properties of $4.9 million, driven by revised market growth assumptions. In the quarter, our development segment generated revenue and net margin of $42.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively, up by $8.7 million and $4.1 million from the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher acre sales volumes in Western Canada and the specific condo occupancy mix relative to the comparative periods.",
         "Final closings at Riverside Square, BT Towns, Canary Block and Canal and Zibi, which in aggregate, comprise over 1,000 condo units are expected to occur in the second half of 2020, which is a significant milestone for our development division. This will result in the collection of approximately $97 million in receivables and their payment of over $88 million in construction facilities at Dream\u2019s share. Through the remainder of 2020, we do not anticipate significant earnings from the division as we now have limited inventory available for occupancy.",
         "Subsequent to quarter end, Dream completed the consolidation of all issued and outstanding subordinate voting shares and Class B common shares on a 2:1 basis. From a reporting perspective, we were required to present all share information on a retrospective basis. Year-to-date, we have purchased 5.4 million subordinated voting shares through our NCIB or a substantial issuer bid for total proceeds of $125.7 million.",
         "With that, I will now turn the call back over to Michael."

      "Michael Cooper": [
         "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. I\u2019m here today with Meaghan Peloso, who\u2019s the Chief Accounting Officer. And between her and I, we are looking forward to giving you an update on the company and answering your questions.",
         "A couple of things. I mean, there\u2019s nothing worse than borrowing, and this year hasn\u2019t been borrowing at all. I think that the nature of a company has been that we continually alter our focus and always try to improve. Generally, we\u2019ve been trying to become a safer and safer business, more recurring income and more liquidity. I think that\u2019s been the goal over the last three years, and I think that the main things that we\u2019re focused on doing is generating recurring income from building best-in-class properties.",
         "And we\u2019re putting a lot of attention to asset management. And unlike in the past, we\u2019re really looking at doing more private asset management. And there we think it will take three years or we\u2019re budgeting that within three years, we\u2019re going to break even. So it\u2019s not going to be interesting in terms of cash flow, but hopefully, if we do a good job, it will be interesting in terms of value, which is consistent with our philosophy.",
         "But on the front, on the income property, it\u2019s pretty exciting. In the next 45 days or so, we\u2019re going to have a building in Saskatoon, apartment building in Saskatoon to finish and start marketing. So that\u2019s the first one of this era. In Ottawa, we\u2019ve got a couple of renovated buildings that the tenants are fitting out. So Zibi will have its first income property. We have two condo buildings that were completed. We\u2019re building an apartment building in Gatineau that\u2019s well out of the ground. It should be finished by November of next year.",
         "We\u2019ll also have the government building that we\u2019re building on the Ottawa side, completed next November. We\u2019re building Block 8 at West Don Lands, and it\u2019s well under construction. We\u2019re building blocks 3, 4, 7, we started next year. And by the end of 2023, we think we\u2019re in close to 2,500 apartment units completed. And that will be a significant change, but we have a tremendous pipeline behind that. So we\u2019re really looking at having success building these income properties. So that\u2019s been coming along pretty well.",
         "If you go around the company, we started to build out providence, a groundbreaking two weeks ago, I guess. I went out to Calgary, and it really was special to be out in Calgary because that\u2019s had six horrific years and able to start a new development where we got construction contracts to build the work, and we\u2019ve got contracts to sell the lots, and it all works together. And the team there put together a press release that said, there\u2019ll be 20,000 years of jobs in our development, $2.5 billion. And it\u2019s a big deal, and we were really \u2013 I was really happy to see the reception, so that that\u2019s a great thing.",
         "This year in Western Canada, like our whole business, it\u2019s not as good as we had hoped initially. And things are way better than we were worried about April. And I think that\u2019s the theme for our company and for many others. So in Western Canada, we\u2019re having better Fortune selling houses and selling lots and getting orders for next year. But overall, the numbers will be a little weak other than the sale of Glacier Ridge. But I think you\u2019ll see over the next few years, our business in Western Canada will be improving, and we\u2019ll continue to generate cash that we will recycle for other uses. So that part is looking pretty good.",
         "Our condo buildings. We closed a lot of condo buildings, not just occupied them but got them registered. We have a few more to go this year, and that\u2019s worked out pretty well. I would say that generally, on the ability we\u2019re building in Ottawa and in Toronto and out West. We are seeing construction costs pretty much consistent with what we budgeted. So that hasn\u2019t been a big deal. And in Downtown Toronto, we got Block 12, which is well under construction, completely sold. That\u2019s going to be a big contributor for 2022, and we\u2019ve got a lot of sites going through planning approvals, and that\u2019s pretty great thing is to have such a pipeline of properties.",
         "Over the last few months, starting March 16, I think it was March 14 three basin, it was closed, and that cost us a lot of money. We entered into the season where we make the most money and it had to close. So we were able to open it on May 27 for 12 days, which was really interesting because it gave us a chance to test out how we can operate in a COVID world. It was very successful, and now we\u2019re dealing with the government at the county level and the governor\u2019s level for how we can open, if you can believe it, another 60 days.",
         "We\u2019re also building two new lifts, an adventure center and via ferrata, which is an incredible rock climbing experience. And we\u2019re making money, we\u2019re getting revenue anyways from these things already this summer. So we\u2019re pretty excited about that. And hopefully, this year will come together. Well, tickets \u2013 season\u2019s pass sales are going fine for us. They\u2019re going great for Altera. So we think that subject to restrictions on how many people can come to ski hill, which we don\u2019t know yet. It\u2019s looking pretty good.",
         "But in Toronto, we have two hotels that were closed, one was at Gladstone. We bought it when lockdown had happened, but we\u2019re renovating. So that\u2019s worked out okay. But I guess the sort of surprising one is between the two hotels and distilleries, we have 10 restaurants that were closed. The Distillery restaurants are open, the Broadview\u2019s open. But altogether, this has been a significant drop in revenue that we hope we can get back for next year. We sold our renewable power, and we did as well as we would have hoped for. So that\u2019s interesting because it contributed a lot of cash, but it really marks that, as I mentioned earlier, we were looking to make more liquidity and continue to increase the quality of our assets.",
         "So prior to COVID, a lot prior to COVID, we sold Dream Global and that worked out pretty well, and we sold Glacier Ridge and that worked out pretty well, and we sold renewable power. All of these things were pre-COVID decisions, but really excited that to basically complete all the areas that we are looking to get cash out of, and the company has a lot of capital. So we\u2019re excited about that. Dream Office is doing well. We\u2019ve been discussing last year, we bought six out of it east at over $800 a square foot, and we\u2019ve just been talking about, would we buy that again at that price today. And I think the whole team feels that we would love to. We haven\u2019t been able to see another asset like that in the last year.",
         "But we\u2019re pretty convinced that downtown Toronto with the type of buildings that we have, will function just fine as we get through this. So we\u2019re pretty happy with how everything is going, which is shocking, considering how much anxiety we\u2019ve had. Our people are doing well. For the rest of the year, I doubt we\u2019re going to make a lot more money than we\u2019ve made because so much of the money that we made this year from the sale of renewable power and Glacier Ridge, but we\u2019ll make a little bit more. And in total, it\u2019ll turn out to be a pretty good year, all things considered. And I would say throughout the company, we\u2019re keeping one eye on how we manage through whatever economic crisis and pandemic we\u2019re having now and the other eye on being steady and opportunistic for the future.",
         "So that\u2019s basic summer where we are. Maybe Meaghan can speak a little bit more specifics, and we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions.",
         "Thank you, Meaghan, and we would be happy to answer any questions that you may have."

So we swapped into that, and we\u2019ve been looking with Paul\u2019s Corp. at doing something with them in apartments in the states. And this is a portfolio that Blackstone was selling, and we were able to negotiate a deal with them. For us, it\u2019s an opportunity to get started with apartments in the U.S. We would look at that on our own book as well as potentially bringing other investors and building some kind of vehicle in the states to continue to grow it. Quite honestly, the returns are pretty attractive, just keeping it on our book. But we\u2019re building on our expertise and our team, and we are looking for more apartments. And we\u2019re probably going to look to see if we could bring in other partners for that and grow it into something that\u2019s meaningful."

That will still leave us with about 500 acres in the first approved area. The next phase is sort of the city center. That phase alone isn\u2019t that big, but the total density on it is equal to Zibi. So now that we\u2019ve got to start it we think the single-family lots will be relatively simple. We think we\u2019ll be producing a lot of cash after we do the first stage of the first five stages. And the big emphasis now is to get the city center organized. It\u2019s approved generally, but we\u2019ve got to do is like a site-specific approval and work with builders to help build it out. So that\u2019s a much bigger undertaking, and what we\u2019re really focused on now is having a good idea of construction costs at the same time as we get commitments from \u2013 for the revenue side with big deposits. So if we can match that up for the next stage, the next phase, the big one to city center. That would be great. But that\u2019s probably two to three years out."

So far, all the work we\u2019re doing are \u2013 is internal. But yes, as \u2013 you\u2019re right as we get to the fall, we started to reach out. But I\u2019ve mentioned it was, I think it could be three or four years before we break even let alone have anything meaningful. So I prefer to have low expectations and time to build it out the way we want to. So we\u2019ve got a couple of business ideas that we are going to introduce in the fall, but it could take a year to get any of them going."

         "Remarks": [
            "It\u2019s a real interesting question because pre-COVID, the prior year, we were on the Vail pass. And then last year, we switched, and we had a very bad fall season because the way we did it with Altera or the Icon Pass is there was restricted uses at A-Basin, so everybody saved there until the spring. So we learned a bit there, but I think we\u2019ll be able to do better this year than last year. The way we\u2019re budgeting it is we\u2019re having a lower required capacity by the county, and that comes off around March 1. So it\u2019s really hard \u2013 but you\u2019ve got to make some pretty big assumptions about what is going to be allowed. But I think we\u2019re figuring we can probably shoot for to make as much as we would have made in the 2018/2019 season with some restrictions.",
            "And without those restrictions, we think we could do a lot better. But if we\u2019re not allowed to be open, it will have a big influence on it. And if this \u2013 whatever \u2013 so it\u2019s still early. And to be clear, this is something that affects Keystone, Breckenridge, Copper Mountain, Beaver Creek, Vail, everybody is working with the governor \u2013 the governor\u2019s office plus Eagle County or Summit County to create the new rules for safety. So on the ski hill itself, there\u2019s really no issues. The issue has to do with \u2013 when people get really cold and there\u2019s a lot of people inside of building. So there\u2019s a lot of new ideas on how to manage that. Obviously, to me, the amazing thing is we\u2019re going to be open in 50 days. So we don\u2019t have all the answers yet, but everybody is working closely to come up with some that works for the county effectively."
