      "Jim Moore": [
         "Thank you, Ron. Welcome everyone. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. With me on the call this morning are Terry Ronan, our CFO; Joe Cofelice, our EVP, Commercial Development; Nick Galotti, our SVP, Operations; and several other members of the Atlantic Power management team.",
         "The results for the second quarter are provided in the press release, the presentation and the prepared remarks, which are all posted on our website last evening. Please review those materials. I will cover the key points this morning and then expand a bit on our free cash flow outlook and thoughts on capital allocation. Following my remarks, we'll take your questions.",
         "We had a solid quarter of financial results, although Project Adjusted EBITDA was modestly below internal expectations for the quarter. Our results for the six months keep us on track to achieve our 2020 guidance for Project Adjusted EBITDA.",
         "We continue to meaningfully repay debt. Year-to-date, we've repaid $37 million of consolidated debt using our strong operating cash flow from existing businesses. Our leverage ratio is 3.8 times at June 30, 2020, or 3.6 times net of cash. We expect to repay another $39 million of consolidated debt in the second half of the year.",
         "We had a very strong first half in terms of capital allocation, we significantly accelerated our return of capital to shareholders with share repurchases under our normal course issuer bid and completion of the substantial issuer bid we announced in late March.",
         "We expect to return the Cadillac plant into operation shortly, right in line with the nine months we said it would take last November. In July, we completed reconstruction and we're currently in the process of commissioning the plant. Once it's back in service, we expect to close out property and business interruption claims with our insurers. Also in July, we completed replacement of the cooling tower at Williams Lake and are targeting returning the plant to operation by the beginning of September.",
         "Commercial update. As we previously announced, Calstock and Oxnard are now both contracted through December. We're working to see if new arrangements can be put in place for next year. We may have more to report next quarter.",
         "Page 5 of the presentation reviews our capital allocation initiatives for this year. As I've noted before, when the stock price sold off with the broader market in late March, we acted with speed and scale in launching a substantial issuer bid for our common shares offering liquidity to those shareholders wishing to exit, and we believe, accretion to intrinsic value for remaining shareholders.",
         "After completing the SIB, we continued to buy shares under the normal-course issuer bid. Year-to-date through July, we have invested a total of $41.6 million to repurchase approximately 20 million common shares at an average price of $2.04 a share.",
         "Let me interject here a thought from Ben Graham chapter 8 -- the famous chapter eight of The Intelligent Investor, where he talked about Mr. Market being a manic depressive. And sometimes the price proposed by Mr. Market is \"a little short of silly.\" Well that's where we believe we are today, and that's why we've been so aggressive in our share repurchases.",
         "So let me recap our securities repurchases since we began them in late 2015. We have allocated more than $80 million to common share repurchases, repurchasing approximately 37 million common shares at an average price of $2.15 per share. Cumulatively, this has reduced our shares outstanding by 27%. In addition, we have allocated more than $25 million U.S. dollar equivalent to repurchase approximately 2.1 million preferred shares at an average discount to par of 37% and after-tax cash yields of between 10% and 12%.",
         "Page six, turning to our five-year free cash flow outlook on page six. I've reviewed this before, so I won't cover the details again today. Let me note the four key takeaways from this slide. First, we expect to continue to delever during this period, repaying $423 million of debt or more than 60% of total debt at the end of 2019.",
         "Second, we expect to have significant discretionary cash flow after the debt repayment of an estimated $115 million to $165 million. This is very meaningful both in absolute terms and of course relative to our current market capitalization of approximately $178 million.",
         "Third, at our current stock prices, this translates to a free cash flow yield to our equity in the low to high teens.",
         "Fourth, our approach to allocating capital will be to assess the impact on our estimates of intrinsic value per share, while balancing risk and reward. We invest externally only when we believe returns are superior to those we can achieve by investing internally or by repurchasing our own shares.",
         "On page six, we've laid out four capital allocation options:",
         "A, Do nothing with the cash, that's unlikely, but would result in us becoming net debt-neutral by 2025; B, Common or preferred share repurchases; C, Seek external growth investments that meet our return criteria, Our capacity to do acquisitions is bolstered by $102 million of availability under the revolver; D, a combination of A, B and C, which seems to us to be the most likely scenario.",
         "Okay. So this morning the key takeaways are that we are expecting to generate excellent free cash flows over the next five years and we've acted with speed and scale when attractive investments are available, such as asset acquisitions prices providing a margin of safety or when our shares trade at a significant discount to our estimates of intrinsic value per share, which is the case today.",
         "We will now take your questions."

            "It's possible. So, look, our modus operandi on investing is the Charlie Munger sit-on-your-rear investing, which is be very patient, build up cash and when you see opportunities move with speed and sale. And so, we didn't do any asset acquisitions for about three years. And then over the course of two years, we did five acquisitions for about $45 million, all of which had very attractive returns.",
            "We'd love to do growth acquisitions. We've done a ton of them over the 40 years or so we've been in the business. It's always our discipline, though to measure those returns versus what we can get from our own shares, which when they're deeply discounted, provide an implied return that's very high, if you get back to your intrinsic value estimates. So that's the way we do it.",
            "We did invest $45 million, which is a meaningful amount. We love that set of acquisitions. We'd do them again tomorrow, if we could. We've been very active out looking at things, but very disciplined. We've looked at a lot of interesting things this year. We've looked at one deal that could be company-transforming, but we didn't pull the trigger on it.",
            "Oftentimes, when companies do company-transforming acquisitions, they turn out to transform you in the wrong direction. But, yes, we're seeing some good stuff. We've got the revolver to use. And we're going to be very active between now and the end of the year. I don't know that we'll close anything before the end of the year, but we're always looking at projects. Does that answer your question?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Understood. Are these acquisitions that you're looking at primarily in North America or do they go beyond?"

         "Speaker": "Adnan Waheed"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah, we haven't really looked outside the \u2013 well yeah, we haven't looked outside North America. I've always had kind of a mantra, which is you never go outside North America. Although in my last company, we made a \u2013 I think it was 10 times return on investment in the U.K. because we had the right person in the right vehicle. But yeah for now with the revolver and our \u2013 the level of our liquidity we're pretty small relative to most companies that are public. And so our universe is pretty wide. And we probably demand a little more of a margin of safety to invest than a lot of the companies.",
            "When I see companies that say they've got a 7% cost of capital and they're investing at 9% that strikes me as a bad deal. Things go wrong with power plants. You have problems. There's \u2013 it's not a utility. So there's no way to recover returns, if you have an overrun on cost or you have a major maintenance issue. So we are always going back to Ben Graham and The Intelligent Investor, we're looking to buy with a margin of safety. It is obvious now that more and more utilities are going to a regulated focus and looking to offload some of the unregulated assets. Some of the funds out there have held assets for a long time, and they need liquidity at some point. So we're very active. But we're also -- we'd love to do what we've done already again, but we're not going to force it."

And that, that certainly has helped our mill production in Ontario, but we have not seen really any immediate impact at all in the Williams Lake area, which is our area of greatest concern. We think that's a great sign and hopefully it will lead to some of the capacity in the area coming back online, which will provide us with additional amounts of fuel. But we haven't seen any real uptick yet."

So it's equipment to slow the equipment down to burn a different mix as well as to better process the fuel that we do have. The mix right now isn't scheduled to change. I mean, we have our suppliers that we're using but it will give us more flexibility for the fuel coming in for a more complete burn."

To date, through July, we've received about $28 million and that's not allocated between property plant and equipment and BI. We're anticipating once the project is complete and up and operating that we'll receive another approximately $10 million that would be business interruption type of insurance or proceeds and we think that by September 30, given where we are today, it will all be wrapped up."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hi. Good morning. I would just like to ask if you could elaborate a little bit on the positive and negative impacts of a high inflationary environment on the company?"

         "Speaker": "Richard Lewis"
      },
      "22": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. So I think that would actually be terrific for us, because for the last 10 or 12 years energy assets have been unpopular. And we're a micro-cap energy contrarian value-investor type of company. And if you get higher inflation then obviously things like re-contracting are probably going to be more valuable and certainly like hydro plants should do very well in that kind of environment. And then I would think sentiment towards energy shares generally would get better.",
            "I think Buffett talked about that on his Annual General \u2013 or his Annual Meeting call that if we start seeing higher inflation we might get more attractive valuations in energy and real assets. And with the amount of money that's been thrown in the system, I see Jeremy Siegel is thinking, we might have 3%, 4% inflation next year. We've seen gold prices pick up and oil prices are still low but they've certainly rebounded.",
            "Power prices actually haven't been that bad. The most recent numbers I looked at look like we're recovering okay. So I think an inflationary outlook and a shift towards energy assets and real assets and probably also a positive effect on our ability to recontract power plants as PPAs roll away would all be good for us. So I don't think there's any real negative aspects for inflation for us.",
            "One of our smarter investors reminds me that we should point out more often how well hedged the company is. And we're hedged against inflation by having commodity producers that would be merchant plants as we go forward. And we have some already. We're well hedged on currency. We're well hedged on interest rates. We're well hedged on commodity prices. We're actually well hedged on taxes. We have a large pool of NOLs. So anyhow it's kind of trying to interpret what macro impact there would be on the company. But my guess is it would be overall a pretty positive thing for us."

      "23": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, thank you. And I have one other question, if you'll be able to do another substantial issuer bid this year?"

         "Speaker": "Richard Lewis"
      },
      "24": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well we ought to have the cash available by the end of the year to do another substantial issuer bid. But we always \u2013 our investment philosophy is to rank-order all our potential uses of capital and come in every day and decide what's the best use of capital, balancing risk and reward.",
            "We've been a very aggressive buyer of shares. Back four, five years ago I mentioned that the insiders had bought shares up to $3.15 and I think maybe even $3.20 and we all thought we were buying below kind of the midpoint of our base case intrinsic value and that's still the case. And so if you're buying shares at $2 or lower, you've got a very good implied return.",
            "The price is just low. It's low relative to our five-year trading range. It's low relative to the analyst estimates that we see \u2013 that I've seen out there recently. It's low relative to our intrinsic value estimates. It's low relative to my best guess of what we could get in a private market transaction.",
            "And luckily for us coming into this year after all the work on debt and interest rates and overhead, we were able to move with speed and scale. There's no guarantees. Our intrinsic value estimates could be wrong but the price right now is at the low end of any analyst estimates we see.",
            "It's at the very low end of any intrinsic value you could come up with. And so it's really the best use of capital I can think of right now. The \u2013 when I was doing a wind company back in 2001 through 2008, and I told the Board that you have to be careful because this is not a great business for buy and hold. It's cyclical. It's capital-intensive. It's commodity-priced. And so generally, you've got to be careful and try to be countercyclical in your investments.",
            "And from 2001 to 2008, I said however, I'm a raging bull and give me all the money you've got and let's put it into wind plants. It was kind of a \"give me all you got, Scotty\" moment. And from 2015 through to today it's been the same thing on our shares. I mean I just \u2013 there's no guarantees in life and it's all estimates and forecasts but I can't think of a better use right now.",
            "And over that period insider ownership has come up from 1% to 4%. And next year we'll work with the Board. We'll try to tie the executive comp more closely to the share price and just tie ourselves to the mast of the share price, because if we can't make money on the share price from here, then we're just way off on what we think the future is going to hold in the energy markets.",
            "But yes, so it will be a strong look between now and the end of the year. I would say almost for sure we'll buy some more under the NCIB but it's all price dependent. So we're not one of these outfits that says, we're going to put X amount of money into the market regardless.",
            "As Buffett said at his Annual General Meeting, there's a lot of political nonsense around share buybacks. And I'm amazed at how much I see on share buybacks where they don't discuss price to value. And that's the preeminent concern right? So we have estimates and they're not precise, they're ranges, we have estimates of value and we compare the price to that.",
            "So at one price, we would issue shares. At another price we'd say, well we're not going to issue shares and we're not going to buy shares. And at another price, we'd say we're going to buy shares. And then at yet another price, we get very aggressive about buying shares. So this year we bought 20 million shares that we canceled, putting over $40 million to work.",
            "So I hope, if the share price remains at this level which I think is the Graham kind of a little short of silly or maybe it's fully silly, then we've got a lot of cash coming in. As I said, we've got $115 million or $165 million of cash flow, free cash flow on top of paying off a boatload of debt the next five years. And at this price the market cap is small relative to that amount of cash flow. So we're going to use it. We're laser-focused on shareholder value and we're going to do whatever we can do to make sure we use that capital wisely and that the current and remaining shareholders end up being rewarded for the prices [purchases - Changed by the company after the call] we were making this year at $2.05 [2.04 changed by the company after the call]."

Well as we reported last quarter, the government issued a -- provided us with a six-month extension to our current contract to enable us and other stakeholders in the province including multiple ministries, the forestry sector to engage in a review process where we would evaluate or the province would evaluate the need for a biomass generation to support the timber industry and to deal -- specifically to deal with waste. And that process is supposed to take six months. That's what's allowed. It's underway.",
            "As we've discussed before the current government of Ontario has drawn a red line in the sand regarding re-contracting in general with the IPPs. And so for us to be successful at the end of the year and gain a new contract for the project, we would need to be successful in making the case that biomass plants are different that they should be compensated for the other benefit streams that they provide such as taking care of the mill waste and general forest management preventing forest fires.",
            "It is too early to tell. That process is underway. But at this point, we still view recontracting as a low probability for no other reason than we do need a change in government policy for that recontracting to take place."
