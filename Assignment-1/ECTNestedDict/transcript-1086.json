         "Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining us. Over the last 3 years, Scripps has articulated a strategy for transformation to create a more durable, higher performing company by improving our short-term financial performance while continuing to build value over a longer term for our shareholders. Over those years, we have executed quite a few important initiatives in pursuit of this strategy, including initiating an enterprise-wide restructuring and cost-cutting, exiting radio, buying the 4 Katz networks and later launching Court TV, acquiring the digital audio infrastructure and measurement leader, Triton and of course, last year, acquiring 27 high-quality local television stations to more than double the size of our local media portfolio. All the while, our focus has been on improving the operating performance of our local television business. We met or exceeded guidance for 10 straight quarters before the pandemic hit this spring. Today, as the fourth largest local broadcaster, our station group is more effective, more efficient and operating with greater strength than it was a year ago.",
         "During last quarter\u2019s earnings call, in the midst of the most sudden and profound business disruption this country has ever seen, we told you that our company would seek opportunity in the chaos to continue our transformation into a stronger company on behalf of our employees and shareholders, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been doing. Most recently, we announced the sale of our podcast leader Stitcher to capture return of more than double our total investment. The sale of Stitcher is an affirmation of our national media strategy and a testament to our ability to create and unlock value through several different paths.",
         "In contrast to our pure-play local broadcast peers, Scripps has taken a dual-pronged approach. We believe in the continued strength and durability of local television. Simultaneously, we are developing growth businesses that look out over the horizon to the future of the media landscape, where we know we\u2019ll recognize high rates of return on our investments, just as we\u2019ve done in podcasting. This strategy has also positioned us well to navigate the economic crisis. We came into 2020 with greater TV station durability, alongside diversified revenue streams coming from our national businesses. Our second quarter results, through the depth of the business disruption, illustrate the point. We held our own with peer performance on Local Media core and successfully renewed 30% of our pay-TV households at rates that we consider an affirmation of our investment thesis. And we turned in National Media results that well outpaced the overall advertising marketplace.",
         "I\u2019d like to highlight Katz, in particular, for its standout performance during this challenging time. In fact, Katz has outperformed our expectations and certainly those of many investors since we bought it nearly 3 years ago. At that time, we saw that consumers were quickly moving to being content-focused and platform-neutral in their TV viewing. They were pulling together their own custom programming bundles combining cable, over-the-air and over-the-top to create a full viewing experience. Since then, over-the-air viewing has continued to grow side-by-side with over-the-top and subscription video-on-demand, as consumers recognized the value of free, high-quality, linear network television. In a study last year, Nielsen projected that 21 million U.S. TV households would come to rely on over-the-air within the next 2 years. We continue to believe in the future value-creation opportunity of over-the-air viewing, and Katz\u2019 financial growth supports the confidence. Remember, their revenue was up more than 30% in last Q4 and Q1 before COVID-19.",
         "Even during the pandemic, Katz has continued to outperform the broader advertising marketplace. Despite the tremendous headwinds associated with COVID-19, Katz finished the quarter flat. That strength is driven largely by its balance of general market and direct response advertising. Many people wrongly dismiss DR as low rate, low-quality ads, but the category has grown and changed tremendously in recent years. Direct Response is a flexible, efficient and measurable way for advertisers to reach their customers. And in case you haven\u2019t been watching, it now goes well beyond the 1-800 and dot-com calls to action. Big name advertisers, including Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Pizza Hut and State Farm now put aside a good portion of their ad dollars for DR. And one industry report estimated DR spending at $12 billion to $18 billion last year. Katz has been a pioneer in crafting content that complements brand\u2019s direct response strategies through audience targeting. So the 3 levers to Katz\u2019 growth have been high-quality programming, over-the-air audience growth and resilience in the national advertising marketplace.",
         "At Scripps, we are fond of saying that two things can be true at the same time. We are big believers in the opportunities ahead in local broadcast television. And the success at Katz, for example, underscores Scripps\u2019 view of the way we\u2019ll also create value in the evolving TV landscape, as we capitalize on consumers\u2019 changing media habits and take advantage of diversified revenue streams. Today, I believe our National Media strategy is not fully appreciated by investors. As we come through the business disruptions and economic fallout from the pandemic, however, I believe it will become even more clear that Scripps has positioned itself well to succeed and to thrive across all of our businesses.",
         "Now here is Lisa."

      "Brian Lawlor": [
         "Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everybody. Well, as expected, the COVID-19 pandemic took a toll on Local Media core advertising in the second quarter, but we\u2019re happy to report results in line with our peers, down about 37% year-over-year. And that\u2019s without the impact of WPIX and despite the loss of NBA finals on our many ABC stations. Our largest categories improved month-to-month in the second quarter. Our largest category services, was flat in June, as was Home Improvement and we continue to see further recovery in July. We expect improvement in the auto category throughout the rest of the year, as manufacturing plants reopen and new car inventory picks up. Dealers already are seeing strong demand and high performance on used cars, as people are starting to migrate away from public transportation and ridesharing for health reasons.",
         "One important way we have combated the slowdown in local advertising has been an aggressive approach to new business development across all of our stations. In mid-March, we initiated a new business sales contest to keep our account executives engaged and focused during the pandemic. Our sellers made thousands of new calls and closed deals with hundreds of new businesses, resulting in $15 million in new business running in the second quarter and more than $30 million booked for the full year. In some ways, the pandemic brought out the best in our account executives and sales leadership. These new to TV advertisers are an important component as we continue to grow our local advertising business.",
         "Political advertising revenue also was a positive story in the second quarter, exceeding our expectations. And based on strong fundraising figures and limited ability to hold in-person events, we continue to have a very positive outlook for TV spending this year. In fact, our July political revenue has already topped our whole second quarter. Here\u2019s some color on the different elections in the Scripps footprint. In the Presidential race, we are seeing both Trump and Biden campaigns, amping up their fundraising to levels well beyond those of 2016. Both candidates are advertising in key states today and Trump has already laid in significant pre-buys for the fall. Right now, they seem most focused on our markets in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio and Wisconsin.",
         "In the U.S. Senate, Scripps stations are well positioned in 6 hotly contested races: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan and Montana. In Montana, the Senate race has its term-limited governor, Steve Bullock, running against junior senator Steve Daines in what will be one of the closest Senate races in the country. In addition, the battle for the Senate majority has sparked unprecedented fundraising and spending so early in a political cycle. And with President Trump\u2019s cartels getting shorter, incumbents in Kentucky, Texas and Iowa are now considered a bit more at risk. In the U.S. House races, pre-book buys from both parties show that packs and campaigns are spending just as we expected. We think our list of 35 competitive seats in Scripps markets should remain stable. We also have an open toss-up governor\u2019s race in Montana, where we have the top-ranked station in each of Montana\u2019s 5 largest markets, resulting in Scripps capturing a large amount of the political dollars being spent in that state. Finally, we expect a high percentage of our political advertising revenue to come from issue spending, where fundraising continues to exceed the experts forecast. All in all, a very good presidential election year is unfolding.",
         "Turning to our retransmission revenue line, as Lisa mentioned, we were still booking our old rates with Dish in the second quarter. Then we went dark with Dish in the third quarter, beginning July 25, after 5 months of negotiating on extensions. We were very disappointed to have experienced our first blackout with a pay-TV provider. As you know, Dish is a veteran of many blackout battles, while Scripps prides itself on getting deals done and, in fact, already has completed several successful negotiations, including 2 large providers this year. Because of those other deals, however, we are confident in our new market value and the appropriate industry contract terms, and we just can\u2019t agree to nonstandard proposals that would disadvantage us. Scripps retrans household subscriber base declined 2.5% in the most recent reporting period ending March 31. That\u2019s a step down from the reporting period, which ended December 31, and when they were about flat over the prior quarter.",
         "I would like to conclude by building on Adam\u2019s comments about the ongoing strength of the 5 Katz networks, as this business reports to me. They have delivered an impressive 14% revenue growth year-to-date. That growth has been driven by strong general market and direct response advertising rates. And both the Grit Network and Court TV saw especially strong revenue growth in Q2, driven primarily by DR. We also continue to see strength in audience viewing at the networks. Viewership at both Bounce and Grit was up 8% over the same time last year due to strong programming, new movie debuts and ongoing pandemic-related increases in TV viewing.",
         "At Court TV, we continue to grow that audience as well. Courts across the country have begun to reopen and just this week, the network is carrying the high-profile Doomsday Trial, preliminary hearings in Idaho. In early May, Court TV carried the historic first live oral arguments from the U.S. Supreme Court. And as protest continued and the social unrest was heightened, the team saw an opportunity to create an original special, Black and Blue, examining the justice system\u2019s relationship with the black community. The special broadcast across all of the Katz networks on June 22 and viewed by nearly 2 million people. Distribution continued to expand in Q2, with Court TV now live on YouTube TV and it\u2019s got its own channel on SiriusXM. Katz\u2019 over-the-air coverage has also grown with Bounce, Mystery, Grit and Laff, each reaching 94% to 96% of the U.S. and Court TV now reaching at 91%. Katz continues to benefit from the growing scale of over-the-air viewing as more and more consumers discover the large amount of free quality programming available there.",

         "Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for a discussion of The E.W. Scripps Company\u2019s financial results. You can visit scripps.com for more information and a link to the replay of this call. A reminder that our conference call and webcast include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ. Factors that may cause them to differ are outlined in our SEC filings. The COVID-19 pandemic enhances the uncertainty of forward-looking statements we make about our operations and financial conditions. Because of this rapidly changing economic climate, we are not issuing third quarter 2020 guidance. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements we make today. We will hear this morning from Scripps\u2019 President and CEO, Adam Symson; CFO, Lisa Knutson; Local Media President, Brian Lawlor; and National Media Executive Vice President, Laura Tomlin. Also on the call is Controller and Treasurer, Doug Lyons. Here is Adam."
      ],
      "Laura Tomlin": [
         "Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. We were very pleased by the resilience of the Katz and Newsy businesses, as the pandemic took its toll on the U.S. economy during the second quarter. Ending the quarter with our division\u2019s revenue nearly flat to the year ago quarter, seems remarkable given the headwinds, and we will continue to build back in the second half of this year.",
         "Overall, the national advertising marketplace has fared better than other ad markets since early March. Big brands quickly recast their messages to create relevance, urgency and currency. We saw consumer products, companies and other businesses shift brand messaging to consumers during stay-at-home orders and a bit later in the quarter on social justice messaging around the unrest. Higher viewership across the 5 Katz networks and Newsy helped us to capitalize on this spending. At Newsy, we saw record viewing levels, as Americans sought information on the coronavirus and the social unrest across the country. Over-the-top viewership driven by Newsy\u2019s younger demographic, was 60% higher during the prior year quarter and streaming viewers stayed with Newsy as their new source. Newsy has also launched its first week night newscast exclusively on OTT. The new show in the loop is designed to give a straightforward look at the day\u2019s biggest headlines and a conversational style that is relatable to its digitally savvy audience.",
         "Also, Newsy and the Scripps Washington Bureau received more noteworthy national recognition for their joint documentary, A Broken Trust. The RFK Journalism Grand Prize and the top prize for domestic television was awarded to the project, which examined how centuries of inequities and legal loopholes have left native American women vulnerable to abuse. Our SaaS digital audio business, Triton, also delivered a good revenue performance in Q2. Triton actually had 11% year-over-year growth, if you factor out the impact of our sale of a noncore piece of its business in Q2 of 2019. Triton\u2019s global sales pipeline began to pick up as we ended Q2, and the company recently announced a series of new deals with international companies. In the second quarter, Triton expanded its podcast ranker to the U.S. This new measurement product, the podcast report, provides both publishers and advertisers with trustworthy third-party data, allowing them to make informed decisions around advertising, with NPR, NBC News and many big terrestrial radio companies. A more robust measurement system is much needed, as that industry grows in reach and scale.",
         "And speaking of scale and podcasting, one of the reasons we are selling Stitcher is a very positive outlook for podcasting in the larger digital audio space. We were early to podcasting and watching the new large company entrants helped us see the opportunity to best capitalize on that investment. As Adam has said, we are constantly evaluating the various paths we can take for our businesses value creation. Regardless of the path, as we were with Stitcher, you can count on us to be disciplined investors in these businesses, focused on fostering growth to achieve the greatest ROI.",
         "And now operator, we are ready for questions."
      ],
      "Lisa Knutson": [
         "Good morning, everyone. The second quarter unfolded generally as we expected in our Local Media division and even better than we expected in our National Media businesses. Since our last earnings call in early May, we\u2019ve also announced the sale of our podcast industry leader, Stitcher, and the option exercise on WPIX in New York. In addition, we are currently in a retrans blackout with satellite television provider Dish. I will discuss each of these events in my remarks this morning.",
         "Let\u2019s start with our second quarter Local Media results. All comparisons of the division financial results are on an adjusted combined basis, continuing our treatment of the former Nexstar-Tribune and Cordillera stations, as though we own them in the full period a year ago. You can find our as-reported results in today\u2019s press release. Local Media core advertising revenue was down 39%, driven by the pandemic-related advertising slowdown. That number is 37%, if you exclude the impact of WPIX and the loss of Yankees and Mets baseball on that station. As we had expected, we see improvement from April to May and from May to June.",
         "We continue to see core ad revenue improve month-to-month through the third quarter. And right now, we expect core advertising to end this quarter, down mid-teens on a year-over-year basis when you factor out the impact of PIX. Political advertising revenue of $13 million came in higher-than-expected in the second quarter that was driven by strong spending in the presidential race and other key context. Because of the robust pacings and the number of competitive races, we now expect to bring in north of $200 million in political ad revenue this year. Brian will give more color in a moment on our political advertising outlook.",
         "Our retransmission revenue was below expectations due to the unwillingness of Dish to agree to fair and reasonable contract terms, but still up 27% from a year ago. Our Dish contract expired on February 29, and we continue to provide service at our old rates under the extensions until we went dark on July 25. We expect to receive the new Dish rate retroactively for the extension period. We did sign a new retrans agreement with a slightly larger distributor that took effect July 1 and now have completed more than 30% of the 40% we are renewing this year. Dish accounts for the final 10%. Local Media expenses decreased 3%, and they came in 10% below second quarter of 2019, when you exclude programming expense. The division did \u2013 had imposed various cost savings initiatives that included merit pay freezes, reductions in capital expenditure and travel and marketing. Segment profit was $32.3 million.",
         "Now let\u2019s discuss National Media division results. Since Stitcher is reported as discontinued operations, the division results no longer include Stitcher for any period. National Media division revenue held up well against the pandemic headwinds in the second quarter. Our national businesses, particularly, benefited from direct response and OTT advertising, which recovered quickly after an initial decline in the early days of the pandemic. The division delivered total revenue of $81 million, essentially flat from the second quarter of 2019. Looking ahead, we expect modest growth in National Media division revenue from the third and fourth quarters. National media expenses came in at $70 million, about flat with last year. And National Media segment profit was $10.3 million compared to $12 million in the 2019 quarter.",
         "Our shared services and corporate expenses were $13 million in the second quarter, down about 15% from our pre-COVID expectations. We expect that line to remain consistent for the third quarter. In May, we told you we plan to make about $85 million in proactive expense control and cash management measures this year. With the sale of Stitcher, we now expect those reductions to total about $75 million this year, about $35 million of savings has been realized year-to-date and another $40 million will come by year end. This company-wide savings includes lower capital expenditures, a hiring freeze, a freeze on merit pay increases, reductions in executive pay and general expense cuts, including travel and marketing. We made about $4 million in dividend payments in the second quarter. The company\u2019s 2Q loss from continuing operations was $0.22 per share.",
         "Now, I would like to briefly discuss the Stitcher and WPIX sales, which were announced on July 13. You can find more details on those transactions in the press releases and investor call transcript from that day. After a strategic review that began last year, Scripps entered into an agreement with SiriusXM to sell its podcast industry leader, Stitcher, for $325 million. That price includes $60 million in earn-outs over 2 years. Our full sale price represents a multiple of 4.5x Stitcher\u2019s 2019 revenue. Our deal represents the largest transaction in podcast industry\u2019s history and a return of more than double Scripps investments since it entered podcasting 5 years ago. Stitcher\u2019s annual losses were in the high teens millions of dollars, so you should see improvement in both National Media division segment profit and in company EBITDA for the previous adjusted reporting periods and going forward. We are filing for Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance this week and expect Stitcher sale to close in the third quarter. Nexstar Media group informed Scripps in mid-July that it had transferred its option to purchase WPIX, the New York City CW affiliate to Mission Broadcasting. At the same time, we were told that Mission was exercising the option to purchase the station. Our pre-agreed price is $75 million, plus about $5 million in interest. Pending regulatory approval, the WPIX deal is expected to close by year end.",
         "Taking into consideration the gain on each of these sales, our cash tax bill for 2020 is expected to be about $24 million, the majority of which we expect to pay in the fourth quarter. The balance would be due in Q1 of \u201821, depending on when the PIX sale closes. Separately, we mentioned in May that we expected to receive a $14 million cash refund in the third quarter, that is the result of carry-back claims available with the Cares Act. So we expect to see a net cash outflow of about $10 million this year, assuming all taxes on the gains are paid this year.",
         "And now a few liquidity items to update you on, our current forecast for full year cash interest is about $85 million. The savings reflects the decline in LIBOR and our plan to pay off our revolver. Our full year capital expenditures are estimated to come in at about $30 million. On June 30, our net debt was $1.9 billion and cash totaled $99 million. Our net leverage at the end of the second quarter was 5.8x per the calculation in our credit agreement. Finally, we were free cash flow-positive in the second quarter and expect to be free cash flow-positive for every quarter of 2020.",
         "And now here is Brian."

It seems like when football starts, those people are canceling their MVPDs. Like you, we have seen, just this week, including this morning, some of the MVPDs reporting positive sub counts that would indicate that maybe the next quarter. And again, they work a quarter ahead of us, maybe more positive than what we saw. So the 2.5% was kind of in line with how we had modeled, and we have \u2013 we do look for a little bit of improvement as we move to the back half."

All of the cards are falling in place between the Gubernatorial and Senate race there. That will be one of our biggest. But I think as you look at Michigan, we will be very strong between the Presidential, strong Senate race there, a couple of House races there. We expect Arizona, again, Presidential, McSally Senate race there. It\u2019s a very competitive \u2013 the competitive \u2013 Gardner Senate race in Colorado as well. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s one race. And I think we have enough that if one were to drop out in the last couple of weeks, a few extras have kind of moved our way. If you remember on the last call, we were talking that in the Senate, we were highly contested in 5 of the races, now that\u2019s moved to 6. So \u2013 and then you see things like McConnell and Kentucky, which we are getting in both Lexington and Cincinnati that has become more aggressive. So actually, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one particular race that puts us at risk. I think we have a lot of coverage across the entire country."

The demand has been picking back up month-over-month in Q2. Rates, has been strong. It did take a dip in April, but we continue to see it improve sequentially each month. So we are pretty optimistic about the growth levels that we hope to see in Q3 and Q4."

There\u2019s been a much higher percentage of prebook dollars for the fall than we have ever seen in the past, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, President Trump already has laid in millions and millions of dollars, there\u2019s some press reports this week that Biden is about to do the same. We think that\u2019s coming in the next week potentially. In many of our contested races and states, we\u2019re already seeing prebook dollars. We are well on our way to the number we have estimated.

And then maybe can you talk more broadly about the DR category understanding the dynamics? How do you think about the longer-term growth in DR relative to the more traditional linear ad business? And then maybe quickly as a follow-up on auto is the reach here that it stays negative? Or is there enough pent-up demand where it could actually tick up?

            "Hey, John, it\u2019s Adam. I will take the first questions on Katz and DR, and then I will pass it to Brian on some commentary on auto. Look, we always assessed opportunities for us to expand the business. I think we are very, very happy with the performance of Katz right now. And so there\u2019s nothing to say that a little bit further down the road as we see additional opportunity for distribution to expand, open up that we couldn\u2019t look for additional options to open another beachhead in over-the-air broadcasting. I think that\u2019s always an opportunity. With respect to DR, DR used to be the lowest rate. And frankly, today, we see DR and hybrid DR, which involves the use of ratings to help establish the currency, as continuing to grow rate. And during this down period, we\u2019ve actually seen DR and hybrid DR rates that have, in some cases, displaced low general market advertising. So we really focus on maximizing yield. The strength we have in DR has helped the Katz networks and Newsy to maximize our overall yield. We don\u2019t really care whether it\u2019s a DR spot or a general market spot, we want the highest rate possible for that spot. And having that strength in DR has given us that \u2013 I think that nice cushion to create that ability to manage yield better, I think, than otherwise. Brian, you want to talk about auto?"

            "Yes. Let me just expand on that for one second, if I can. Based on the increases in viewing that we\u2019re seeing as a result of pandemic, the general \u2013 the DR clients are getting a really good response. And when they get a really good response, meet the week, they\u2019re willing to book more inventory at higher unit rates. And so as Adam said, in many cases, we are seeing DR rates that actually rival or surpass general market rates. And keep in mind that on a DR rate, we don\u2019t have to post to a Nielsen rating. And so there\u2019s actually a really rich business for us in direct response, as a result of the success we\u2019re having and the fact that we don\u2019t have to post. Shifting over to just automotive. I think automotive is going to continue to be challenged this year just because of the lack of inventory. I think demand is very high. I think as vehicles, finally, get back out of the production facilities, get distributed through the country, I think there\u2019s a waiting list of people who will be gobbling those up. So I do think that there\u2019s going to be a lot of momentum. And therefore, I think there\u2019ll be a lot of advertising as people are trying to \u2013 the dealers are trying to let people know when inventory is hitting their lots. But I\u2019m not sure if they can get enough inventory to push the category positive. Now we may see as we get to the end of the year, as new brands coming out next year, the Ford Bronco and others and you may see some branding that begins to lay the foundation for next year, expecting that next year will be very strong and a rebound year. I\u2019m just not sure if either of the two remaining quarters, especially with the displacement that we actually move to positive on auto."

            "Yes. Look, I think it\u2019s been an interesting 4 or 5 months now. We saw the surge in COVID-19 viewing and that really drove audiences anywhere from 15% to 50% up. It began to settle down a little bit. And then we saw, as a result of the protests another increased level of interest now with all of the political narrative that\u2019s happening. There\u2019s a high level of interest. There really is so much going on. So we continue to see especially in the early evening and late news, a real spike in news viewership. The morning has been disrupted a little bit as a result of changing lifestyles with less people commuting to work. The 6:00 to 7:00 a has rebound a little bit. The 4:30 to 6:00 a continues to be down. But also as a result of that, people are staying up a little later because they are not getting up as early. And so we have seen a bump in the late news. So that has remained consistent. It\u2019s double-digit growth on a percentage basis across the country, and it would appear much of the country is going to continue to operate with this kind of lifestyle through the rest of this year. And so we\u2019re going to continue to take advantage of that."

In some of the states that you\u2019re in where the virus cases have picked up significantly, things have gotten tighter from a government control standpoint, if you will. Have you seen any significant changes in the ad revenue trends? Or is it too hard to parse that apart in some of the select states in your mind?"

We\u2019re not seeing a meaningful change in those states versus many of the others. Business is open everywhere. Car dealers are open. Furniture stores are open. Malls are open. Clearly, how each of them operates with their social distancing precautions is different. But even in Florida and Texas and other places, we\u2019re not seeing a material change or meaningfully lower ad numbers than we are seeing in the states that are more open for business."

            "Yes, we shut down everything we possibly could. So typically in there, you have our facilities, towers, repairs, supplies. We have a lot less people in our buildings. And so we\u2019re repairing less things. We have less of a need for supplies. And then you think of travel and entertainment. Travel has basically been halted across the division. Entertainment has ceased for the last couple of months. We did freeze pay increases for all of our employees this year. So that had an impact in our employee cost line. But I think once this started, we made a commitment to our employees that we were going to stand by them, and we have, and we are incredibly proud of that. But we were also going to be fiscally responsible through this period, and we locked down every expense we possibly could."

Over-the-air, what percent of household viewership in your markets, or you-want-to-just talk about the entire U.S. do you think that represents right now? So I\u2019m very optimistic about that, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking."

It can be \u2013 the average right now, I think, in the latest survey from Nielsen, was around 16% or 17%, for the nationwide."
