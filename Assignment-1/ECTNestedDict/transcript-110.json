      "Bryan Fairbanks": [
         "Thank you, Bill. Good afternoon everyone. We welcome you to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we get into the quarter results, let me take a moment to thank the people who made this quarter's success possible. First, I commend the entire Trex team for their hard work and dedication to ensure we maintain continuous operations and we were able to sell our products in a safe and effective manner during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "We are also immensely grateful to our channel partners who in no small part contributed to the success we have seen this year. Despite the unprecedented challenges arising from the pandemic, they found ways to serve customers and keep their employees safe. Thank you again to the extended Trex team.",
         "We continue to drive improvements across the company with a focus on health and safety of our employees the needs of our customers and operational excellence. This disciplined approach allows us to execute through a challenging macro environment while we continue to invest in the future and generate further shareholder value.",
         "By all measures, this was a strong quarter for Trex. We increased revenue by 7%. It's fair to say that the resilience of the Trex customer far surpassed our expectations at the beginning of the pandemic when we saw key states with major population centers shut down large portions of their economies.",
         "We increased EBITDA by 32% to $67.5 million. We invested $40 million in the second quarter primarily for capacity expansion and we achieved a 33% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.81. Our sales growth reflected both the strength of the fast-growing outdoor living category and the high demand for Trex decking and railing products.",
         "Our Trex Enhance decking products which appeals to the more cost-conscious consumer, have significantly expanded the size of our addressable market, and accelerated Trex' ability to take share from wood -- which today accounts for approximately 80% of decking materials used.",
         "At the same time, Trex Transcend and Trex Select decking continue to grow appealing to homeowners looking for advanced performance materials with market-leading aesthetics. We remain focused on allocating cash flow to our capacity expansion program which progressed considerably in the second quarter.",
         "By the end of the quarter, we started three new production lines at our Nevada facility. With these Nevada lines up and running, we will now direct our primary attention to our new production facility in Virginia with the first of those new lines coming online in the first quarter of 2021. We are also committed to our environmental, social and governance heritage.",
         "As we prepare to release our updated ESG report in the next couple of weeks, I wanted to share a few key improvements that we have made. As a reminder for those that may be newer to the Trex story, since inception our decking products have been made with 95% recycled material content. Recycled consumer and industrial polyethylene film and reclaimed wood are the primary material sources for Trex decking. In addition our aluminum railing is made with approximately 50% recycled content.",
         "Since our 2016 life cycle analysis, the environmental footprint for Trex decking has improved across all impact categories. We think this is particularly noteworthy given the increased production associated with the introduction of our new Enhance decking product, sourcing more materials to support higher volume, upgrading our manufacturing operations and improving the output on legacy product lines. We are very proud that the result of our water conservation efforts. Approximately 99% of the water used in our Virginia and Nevada facilities are now recycled.",
         "Additionally, Trex' safety program resulted in a 24% reduction in recordable incident rates over the same two-year period and we were able to achieve a 25% increase in retention of our hourly team during a period of very low unemployment rates. Do the right thing is our operating philosophy and I'm convinced that it helped Trex achieve a 150 basis point improvement in gross margins during the quarter.",
         "At Trex Residential, gross margin improved by 80 basis points primarily driven by a material reduction in our Enhance products, which more than offset the increased costs associated with start up of the new lines in Nevada.",
         "Trex Commercial improved gross margin as well, benefiting from the absence of low-margin legacy contracts coupled with the mix of higher margin contracts, better execution and manufacturing cost savings. We continue to be encouraged by the progress being made at the Commercial segment.",
         "I'd like to welcome Laura Rygielski Preston to the Trex Executive team as President of Trex Commercial Products. Laura came onboard last week and has an impressive record of driving growth and implementing operating and efficiencies in her prior 10 years with Trane Technologies and Johnson Controls. We are confident she will further accelerate the momentum that we're seeing in the business.",
         "In summary, this was a strong execution quarter for Trex, capping the first half where we saw 9% sales growth within a challenging operating environment. I'm pleased to report that the positive momentum we experienced in the second quarter has continued into the third quarter. Demand for our products and discussions with our channel partners and sales teams are providing us with increased visibility and confidence for the second half of the year.",
         "We estimate consolidated net sales of $215 million to $225 million for the third quarter, representing year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint. While we are encouraged by the current demand climate, we are further inspired by the opportunities for sustainable long-term growth. As many of you have heard me say in the past, we're in the very early stages of converting the large wood market to low maintenance Trex composite decking and railing. We will see many of year\u2019s growth opportunities ahead.",
         "I'll now turn the call over to Dennis to provide additional details on our financial results, balance sheet and outlook. ",
         "Thanks, Dennis. I'm proud of the entire Trex team and the unrivaled strength of our channel partners. Their exceptional efforts and resilience have allowed Trex to execute our strategy and operate with excellence through a very challenging time. Through our combined efforts, we will continue to generate strong cash flows and reinvest that cash into our business to further build market share, extend our cost leadership and provide significant returns to our shareholders.",
         "Operator, I'd like to open the call to questions."
      ],
      "Dennis Schemm": [
         "Thank you, Bryan, and good afternoon to everyone on the line. This was another period of strong financial performance for Trex. Consolidated net sales increased 7% to $221 million led by an 8% sales increase in Trex Residential products. This impressive growth reflects robust and broad-based demand for composite decking and railing products and our brand leadership, which is driving continued market share gains from our main competitor, wood. Throughout the quarter we continue to see unprecedented demand indicators from our websites including trex.com and decks.com.",
         "Consolidated gross margin in the second quarter increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 41.9%. Trex Residential Products gross margin expanded by 80 basis points to 42.5%. This improvement is primarily related to our success in removing material from the Trex Enhance board and improved throughput, which more than offset increased start-up costs associated with our Nevada lines.",
         "We expect to return to the original Trex Enhance design by the end of the third quarter of 2020. And as we have noted in the past, we will be bringing on labor in advance of the Virginia start-up, which will have an impact on the second half of the year.",
         "Trex Commercial Products, gross margin increased to 30.7% from 21.4%, reflecting our execution of higher-margin products this quarter as well as in overall operating improvements.",
         "SG&A expenses were $29 million compared to $36 million in the second quarter of 2019. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A declined to 13.2% compared to 17.3%. The savings were primarily driven by disciplined spending as the effects of the pandemic played out.",
         "Our branding and advertising expense was lower than normal as we pulled back on spending early in the quarter as many jurisdictions ordered the closure of the businesses in the construction industry and there were areas where our channel partners closed.",
         "Later in the quarter, as closures were lifted and our channel partners reopened we began to increase our spending. We expect to see spending on branding and advertising to return to a more normalized level of between 5% and 6% of sales as we move forward.",
         "The tax rate in the second quarter was 25.6%, up slightly compared to 25.2% in the year ago quarter. Net income was $47 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, up 32% and 33% respectively from $36 million or $0.61 per diluted share reported in the second quarter 2019. EBITDA was up 32% to $68 million, while EBITDA margin expanded 580 basis points to 30.6%.",
         "Our performance year-to-date has been equally strong. Consolidated net sales were $421 million representing a 9% increase from 2019 led by a 10% increase in Trex Residential Products sales to $396 million. Year-to-date, net income was $90 million or $1.54 per diluted share compared to $67 million or $1.14 per diluted share. EBITDA was up 34.9% to $126 million, while EBITDA margin expanded 570 basis points to 30%.",
         "Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows. Our $200 million capital expansion program, which will enable us to meet continued growth remains on track and within our expectations. First half capital expenditures were $63 million, compared to $19 million a year ago, which are primarily related to our capacity expansion program.",
         "In May of 2020, we amended and restated our revolving credit agreement to provide us with an additional $100 million of borrowing capacity bringing our total revolver to $350 million. The purpose of the additional $100 million in revolving credit is primarily to reduce risks associated with COVID-19 pandemic. We had no outstanding borrowings at the end of the quarter.",
         "Reflecting our positive outlook, the Trex Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one stock split of the company's common shares. The stock split will be in the form of a stock dividend to be distributed on September 14, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 19, 2020.",
         "I will now provide additional insight regarding expectations for the third quarter and full year 2020. We expect consolidated net sales for the third quarter to be in the range of $215 million to $225 million. We expect full year consolidated incremental gross margins to be 45% to 50%, inclusive of additional COVID-related expenses.",
         "We expect full year consolidated SG&A as a percentage of sales to improve by 80 to 100 basis points over the prior year. Our tax rate is anticipated at approximately 25%. We expect full year spending on CapEx to be in the range of $150 million to $170 million. And day sales outstanding will be higher in the third quarter compared to the prior year, because of our sales programs, which were set at the end of 2019. For the full year working capital will normalize to historical levels.",
         "Now I'll return the call back to Bryan. "

I already had that in my model. But is this just the new lines coming on and this is unproductive labor and D&A, or is there anything else?"

But yes, exactly right. In the back half of the year, we are seeing additional labor coming into our manufacturing facilities, primarily in Virginia. That's where the majority of the labor will be as we begin to train them up for the new lines that will start in early 2021. We'll also see some of the depreciation from the new lines started it up in Nevada."

We are seeing certain projects being pushed out to 2021, and we're also seeing other projects that are coming back in. We're not really seeing at this point any cancellations of those projects along the way. So I may see a little more volatility on that number.

Just -- are the costs or the labor and start-up costs in Virginia, are they greater than kind of -- carry a greater cost than sort of the existing lines starting up? And does that anniversary in the second half of 2021? How should we think about when that's fully phased in? Thanks."

We'll see whether this is a sustained price increase in the market or once they get back to full capacity and get back to normal inventories, if it goes back to the more normalized price along the way.",
            "Something that we do keep an eye on. I think, I've always said in the past, where minor changes in lumber really don't impact our strategy. So instead of being $0.85 a foot for a normal piece of pressure tree, let's say, it goes to $0.95, or drops down to $0.75 for a period of time. That's not going to have an impact on our strategy immediately.",

Do you have enough capacity at this juncture at least for the back half for you to kind of sustain that low to mid-teen growth trajectory? And any color on how lead times are kind of shaking after your channel partners? Should that kind of return back to more normalized levels by year-end?"

And is that 80 to 100 basis points of leverage you're kind of talking about for this year is that a reasonable way that we can kind of think about the next couple of years or are there some kind of benefits here in 2020?"

So SG&A as a percentage of sales, it's certainly lower this quarter because in certain jurisdictions, during the year, right or in the beginning of the quarter, businesses were closing down in that construction sector and as a result, certain of our channel partners also shut down as well. As a result, we pulled back on some of that advertising and branding, as we saw the reopening start to occur, restrictions starting to lift, we began to put that money back into play putting more branding and advertising back into the quarter. Over the longer run though, we still expect to see our branding and advertising spend to be around 5% to 6% of sales. So that seems to be something that makes sense for us on a historical basis and a go-forward basis."

Let Dennis take that away and talk about what we can do maybe in the third quarter to help out. I think you're going to see in the third quarter a change in D&A that will help you be able to model the number for next year, because it is quite a bit more capacity in Virginia than what we're opening in Nevada."

Well it was in line with our expectations, but we did see at that time the expectation of May falling off. And it did a little bit early on with the various states that were closed and then picked up in the back half of May and into June to deliver the revenue that we delivered. In those states where DIY customers remained for the most part open, we did see a bit of a shift to those retailers. But we saw that both of the products they had on the shelf as well as to the special order demand. We did see that shift back again as all of the channels were able to reopen again. So there was just a little bit of a onetime shift. I don't see that as being something that will be ongoing there. "

It was about bringing them into the channel, have the discussions, understand that there are other product lines that may carry a higher level of aesthetic and a potential higher level of performance. That's exactly what we've seen now that we're 1.5 years into that strategy. Now will we see some mix shift? I'm sure there will be some along the way. We are working to convert that wood marketplace and we may see more people who make that decision because of the cost within Enhance Basics that they're willing to make that change and install that product along the way.

But is that the -- first off I want to make sure I heard that right? And then secondly is that about the time when you guys expect to have those lines up and running to the point where I guess the volume kind of catches up with the labor and the other costs you're bringing on there.

So we're bringing on labor now. We're going to start training them, getting them geared up to be able to run those lines.

I'll go back to the comments I made with the last question that all those customers didn't immediately rush in and buy the entry-level product. They were there to have the discussion understand that composite products are affordable and will provide lasting low maintenance product for them. They moved up to Enhance Naturals.",
