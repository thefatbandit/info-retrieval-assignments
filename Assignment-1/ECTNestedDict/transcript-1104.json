      "Chris Bagley": [
         "Thanks, John and Dan. Good morning, everybody. starting on slide 7, you\u2019ll see our funding mix as of June 30, compared to both the first quarter of 2020, second quarter of 2019. We experienced deposit growth for the quarter of $2.4 billion. Additional customer liquidity created by government stimulus, most notably, the $1.2 billion in PPP loan funding certainly aided deposit growth, but when you adjust for the government stimulus programs, we estimate our growth in deposits to be approximately $1 billion or 24% annualized.",
         "Most of the deposit growth for the quarter occurred in transactions accounts, both not-interest bearing and interest bearing demand deposits. John mentioned, we were able to achieve reductions in our total deposit costs which declined from 67 basis points for the first quarter to 50 basis points, perhaps we continue to monitor our markets and adjusting rates accordingly where we can to stay competitive and as well as manage our deposit costs across the footprint. From a loan perspective, the quarter is the story of PPP or what some of us have dubbed P3, we produced approximately 1.2 billion P3 loans. It has only been achieved with an all-hands effort from our teammates across the entire footprint. I\u2019m extremely proud of our team, they worked long nights and they worked weekends to exceed our customer expectations.",
         "Moving to Slide 8, you\u2019ll see our loan portfolio as of June 30, compared to the first quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2019. Total loans increased 1.2 billion for the quarter, not coincidentally is equal to our P3 production for the quarter. When we adjust for this program, our organic loan growth was otherwise essentially flat in the quarter. None of us were surprised by flat loan growth without P3. P3 was the first and foremost priority of our customers during the quarter and so it was our bankers as well. When you consider the time and effort that has gone into the P3 program and the fact that economic activity wasn\u2019t a momentary shutdown, we feel was an overall positive to hold our loan balances somewhat stable.",
         "Slide 9 covers P3 in more detail. Dan mentioned, we generated approximately 14,500 loans totaling $1.2 billion. It\u2019s quite to an average loan size of $85,000, a very granular loan size and the benefit to the small businesses in the communities we serve. The pie chart on the slide shows the distribution of our PP \u2013 I\u2019m sorry I messed up P3 loans by state. The P3 loans were a drag on both our net interest margin and average loan yield for the quarter. When you consider both the origination fee and the direct expenses, we expect total yield on these loans to be approximately 2.5%. This could be a bit lumpy going forward as the timing of forgiveness or other prepayments could impact the yield as the remaining unamortized origination fee would then be recognized as interest income at the time the loan is paid down or forgiven.",
         "Moving to Slide 10, we can cover some credit quality highlights for the quarter. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $20 million for the quarter. Dan mentioned certain assumptions within the economic forecast used in our CECL model show deterioration compared to March 31. Our most \u2013 significant from a modeling perspective being the unemployment rate. Our net charge-offs for the quarter were low at 3 basis points or $1.2 million. Provisioning for the quarter combined with the low net charge-off number increased our allowance coverage from ratio to 1.67% including P3 loans from 1.53% at the end of the first quarter. We continue to actively monitor the segments of the loan portfolio that have been identified as higher risk as a result of the pandemic.",
         "At the time we had our last quarterly call, approximately 17% of our loan portfolio was in deferral, this is by total balance outstanding. This percentage peaked in mid-June and was at 22.2% at the end of the quarter. We\u2019re expecting during July a large percentage of the credits and deferral resume the normal P&I payments, as our customers have gained more economic clarity in their perspective businesses. As of Friday, July 17, the percentage of portfolio in deferral declined to 13.3%. We\u2019ve received applications for second deferral on less than 5% of the credits for which the original deferral has matured.",
         "For the commercial book, remember our deferrals were primarily 90 day deferments and only performing loans that were current qualified for deferral. The uncertainty of the shutdown caused many to want to maintain and protect liquidity. As these 90 day deferments expire, we\u2019re seeing many of our clients returning to their scheduled payments. We continue to expect additional support requests concentrated in the higher risk portfolios and more specifically the hotel and hospitality segment.",
         "Slides 11 through 14 provide an updated view of the more granular information that we provided last quarter related to the higher risk portfolios. We added two data points for you on each of the tables presented. This information includes the percentage of the loans in deferral about June 30 and July 17. We are monitoring these portfolios more closely with our internal processes. As we are further from year-end and from initial shutdown, more customer data and financial information has become available. For additional deferment requests, we are requiring more information and a more rigorous analysis of shutdown impacts to the customer.",
         "Today, our experiences that many of our customers are able to return to normally scheduled payments. And most of the additional support requests are coming from the hospitality sectors that I mentioned. Our CRE Retail and Medical appear to be bounding and stable at this time, although most medical is still operating at a somewhat reduced capacity. From a hospitality perspective, our focus has been communicating with our customers, monitoring occupancy rates and verification of liquidity sources. It is apparent that overall occupancies on average have increased from the low in March and April. We also see some geographies doing quite well, Florida Panhandle would be an example of that today. Today, we feel positive about the majority of our operators\u2019 ability to weather the storm. The question of course is how long is the storm? The start stop nature of the response to COVID will continue to put stress on this book and potentially other portfolio segments.",
         "Moving to mortgage and insurance. The tables on Slide 15 provide a five quarter look at our results for each product offering. Our mortgage banking operation had a record quarter, producing outstanding production of almost $1 billion in mortgage loans for the quarter contributing to $31.9 million in production and servicing revenue. This represents more than twice our average quarterly historical volume. Our team has worked tirelessly to achieve these results. The rate environment continues to drive refi activity, but the purchase money market is holding up extremely well. Totaling 523 million or 53% of our total volume for the quarter.",
         "Believe it or not, we increased our pipeline total from 570 million at the end of last quarter to 692 million at the June 30. This pipeline increase combined with the widened spreads based on capacity constraints resulted in another out-sized quarter from a margin perspective, a 5.45%. As we said before, the level of margin isn\u2019t sustainable over the long-term, we\u2019re extremely proud of our mortgage team and the contribution they\u2019ve been able to make to our financial performance during very challenging time for our economy and our industry.",
         "Moving to Insurance, total commission revenue for the quarter was 33.1 million compared to 29.6 million for the first quarter of 2020 and 34 million for the second quarter of 2019. As we mention each quarter, we typically benchmark to the same quarter in the prior year given the seasonality of our renewal cycles. The story of our insurance business is essentially the same as last time we spoke. We had a slight decline in our contingent commission accrual compared to the second quarter of last year otherwise insurance commission revenue was \u2013 remained essentially flat.",
         "And as we mentioned in last quarter, we continue to have a very high renewal success rates for our current customers, but it\u2019s very difficult to win any business in this environment right now. Our insurance teammates will continue to work to protect the relationships that we have and the win new ones, if and when the opportunities present themselves, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Dan for his concluding remarks."

      "Dan Rollins": [
         "Thank you, Will. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to discuss BancorpSouth\u2019s second quarter 2020 financial performance. I will begin by providing an update on the impact of the pandemic to our company, as well as making a few comments on second quarter financial performance. John will discuss the financial results in more detail. Chris will provide more color on our customers and business development efforts. After we conclude our prepared comments, our executive management team is here to answer your questions.",
         "Let\u2019s turn to the slide presentation. Slide 2 contains the legal reminders, Will has already discussed. Before we get into the financial highlights, I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it\u2019s having on our company and the markets we serve. When we last spoke, we had hoped we would be further along at this point and our return to a more normal operations and a more normal lifestyle. With the case counts, continuing to rise across our footprint and actually this week hitting new daily records and new cases for several states we cover, that\u2019s unfortunately not the case. Protecting the health and wellbeing of both our teammates and our customers has been and will continue to be our top priority.",
         "We are continuing to have our teammates, who can work remotely, do so. We also continue to operate our branch lobbies by appointment only. We\u2019ve been pleased with our ability to adequately serve our customers through them \u2013 through our mobile offerings, along with the drive-through processes and the availability of our teammates by appointment as needed. Our relationship managers and credit administrators continue to work with our customers in an effort to assist them in working through this difficult time. Chris will certainly provide more detail and update on credit quality in a moment, but just to give you a few high level statistics.",
         "As of our last quarter call, approximately 17% of our loan portfolio by balance was in deferral. As of today, 13% is in deferral after peaking at over 22% in mid-June. This obviously shows that the pace of deferrals has slowed significantly and many of our customers have resumed making normal P&I payments. Most of our initial deferrals were for a 90-day period. And we\u2019ve learned that many of our customers who deferred would not \u2013 would have been just fine without a deferral actually, approximately 10% of customers on deferral actually continued to make payments. However, we anticipate others will likely need a second 90-day deferral. Again, Chris will provide more information in just a moment.",
         "Let\u2019s discuss the quarter. Slide 3 contains our financial highlights for the second quarter. We continue to be pleased with the core operating performance of our company. Given the volatility in earnings associated with the provision, we continue to monitor pre-tax, pre-provision revenue or PPNR as we work through this cycle. We generated record PPNR for the quarter totaling $102.1 million or $1 \u2013 excuse me, 1.81% of average assets on an annualized basis. This represents an increase from 1.73% for the second quarter of last year and 1.74% for the first quarter of this year. I would again point out that we adjust for non-operating items and our calculation of this metric, which is defined and reconciled in our earnings release.",
         "We reported GAAP net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter of $58.8 million or $0.57 per diluted common share. We had a negative MSR valuation adjustment of $2.4 million, while merger-related expenses totaled $0.5 million for the quarter. Accordingly, our net operating income excluding MSR was $60.9 million or $0.59 per diluted common share Earnings were obviously, adversely impacted by the provision for credit losses of $20 million.",
         "Given the deferrals and the government stimulus program, it\u2019s still way too early in the process to see specific credit issues arising. However, under our CECL framework, the provision was recorded to reflect the additional deterioration and the economic forecast for certain metrics, including unemployment that we use in our process as compared to those same estimates on March 31. This provision combined with a very low net charge-off number of $1.2 million resulted in our allowance coverage increasing to 1.67% of net loans and leases when you exclude the PPP loans. We believe this coverage level puts us in a great position to absorb any potential credit losses that arise as this economic cycle progresses.",
         "I\u2019d like to spend just a few minutes on our balance sheet growth for the quarter. Our team has worked tirelessly over the past three months to originate and fund approximately 14,500 payroll protection program loans before the end of the last quarter, totaling $1.2 billion. It took a collective team effort from both our relationship managers and support staff to accomplish this task. The funds from the government stimulus program certainly aided our deposit growth efforts. Deposit growth totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter. Even without the additional liquidity created by the stimulus program, organic deposit growth totaled approximately $1 billion or 24% on an annualized basis, which is a tremendous accomplishment for our bankers.",
         "We actually opened 23% more transaction accounts during the second quarter of 2020 than we did during the second quarter of 2019. The PPP loans and the additional liquidity created by the deposit growth weighed on our margin for the quarter. John will go over margin details in just a moment.",
         "Last, certainly not least from a business development perspective, our mortgage team had a record quarter. Production volume totaled $989 million, which contributed to production in servicing revenue of $31.9 million for the quarter. 53% of our production during the quarter was new home purchase loans. The refinance volume has obviously been elevated given the rate environment. Chris will provide a little more information on this.",
         "Finally, we continue to be pleased with our capital position. We announced in last quarter\u2019s call that we would not repurchase additional shares until received further clarity on the economic impact and duration of this pandemic. Accordingly, we did not buy any shares in the second quarter. We will continue to monitor the economic outlook as it relates to our share repurchase program. Total risk-based capital at June 30 was 13.79%, which represents an increase from 13.75% at March 31. Each of our regulatory capital ratios continues to remain in excess of 300 basis points above well-capitalized thresholds.",
         "John, I\u2019ll let you share some financial results.",
         "Thanks Chris. As we move into the second half of the year, we will continue to actively monitor the impact of the virus on the markets we serve and be prepared to act very quickly on any changes. As we\u2019ve said over-and-over, the health and wellbeing of our employees and our customers will be the most important factor in each and every decision we make. We are open for business and our team is ready to meet each and every customer need. Our credit administrators and relationship managers are actively engaged with our customers and assessing the impact on their business and determining how we can help them through this difficult time. We continue to feel very good about our financial performance in light of these circumstances. And we are hopeful that things will look much better the next time we visit for third quarter earnings.",
         "Operator, we\u2019re now happy to answer questions."
      ],
      "John Copeland": [
         "Thanks, Dan and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. If you turn to slide 4, you\u2019ll see our summary income statement and Dan has covered many of these numbers already, but they do bear repeating I think. net income available to common shareholders was $58.8 million or $0.57 per diluted common share for the second quarter. The negative MSR valuation adjustment of $2.4 million was really the only significant non-operating item in our second quarter results.",
         "Accordingly, we reported net operating income, excluding MSR available to common shareholders of $60.9 million for the quarter or $0.59 per diluted common share, compared to $34.4 million or $0.33 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2020 and $62 million or $0.61 per diluted common share for the second quarter of 2019.",
         "I would remind you that the mergers with Texas First, Summit Bank and Texas Star Bank impact the comparability of financial information shown on this slide, as well as the subsequent slides that we will discuss to the second quarter of 2019. comparability to the first quarter of 2020 is not impacted as all three of those mergers were closed on or prior to the beginning of the year.",
         "This slide also highlights the practice tax pre-provision net revenue metrics that Dan mentioned. both in terms of dollars and as a percentage of average assets, we continue to be pleased with the trend in this metric, although the level of mortgage revenue that we\u2019ve been able to generate the last couple of quarters and that greatly contribute to the improving PPNR likely, isn\u2019t system available long-term.",
         "Our net interest revenue increased by 1.8% compared to the first quarter of 2020 and increased by 6.6% compared to the second quarter of last year; as it relates to the income dollars, PPP volume certainly helped us somewhat offset the headwinds resulting from margin pressure. There are obviously, a number of moving parts in the margin this quarter, given the balance sheet mix shift resulting from the PPP program and elevated deposit growth.",
         "Our net interest margin, excluding accretable yield, declined to 3.3% for the quarter from 3.48% for the first quarter of 2020. of this decline, PPP activity accounted for five basis points while the additional mix shift resulting from the outsize deposit growth related to PPP, contributed to another eight to 10 basis points of decline.",
         "These two items explain much of the margin movement. There are obviously several other moving parts within the margin adjustments to floating rate loans resulting from the March fed rate cuts accounted for approximately 18 basis points of loan yield decline while PPP loans were responsible for about 14 basis points of the decline. Chris will discuss it more in a moment, but we also noted meaningful improvement in our funding costs as our total cost of deposits declined to 50 basis points from 67 basis points for the first quarter of the year.",
         "before we move to non-interest revenue expense, you can clearly see the impact of the provision that Dan mentioned earlier on earnings. We had a provision of $20 million for the quarter, compared to provision of $46 million for this first quarter of 2020 and a provision of 500,000 for the second quarter of last year. Dan also mentioned the impact of the pandemic on our provision and Chris will touch on credit quality in more detail in a moment.",
         "If you turn to slide 5, you\u2019ll see a detail of our non-interest revenue streams. Total non-interest revenue was $91.3 million for the quarter, compared to $76.5 million for the first quarter of 2020 and $66.3 million for the second quarter of last year. Mortgage revenue continues to be the largest driver of volatility in these totals across the quarters.",
         "As Dan mentioned, our mortgage team had a record quarter. Chris will discuss the dynamics of a mortgage business more in a moment, but production and servicing revenue increased by over $11 million compared to the first quarter. You\u2019ll also notice a meaningful decline in our deposit service charge revenue. We\u2019ve waived more service charges and fees in an effort to assist our customers during the downturn.",
         "Finally, I would briefly mention that the variance and other miscellaneous income is driven by a $4 million book gain on the insurance book of business disposition that was recorded and disclosed in our first quarter results. slide 6 presents a detail of non-interest expense. total non-interest expense for the second quarter of the year was $162.5 million, compared with $168 million for the first quarter of this year and $157.7 million for the second quarter of last year.",
         "total operating expense, which excludes merger-related expenses and other one-time items was $162 million for the quarter compared to $163.5 million for the first quarter of 2020 and $154.5 million for the second quarter of 2019. Most of these expense items are fairly stable quarter-over-quarter. There are only a couple of variances, I think that warrant mentioning a merger expense obviously declined considerably, given there were no merger closings or conversions in the quarter. And finally, other miscellaneous expenses declined approximately $3 million compared to the first quarter, driven primarily by the reduction in the meals and entertainment expense as well as travel-related expenses, given the restrictions around the pandemic.",
         "That concludes our review of the financials. Chris can now give us some more color on our business development activities."

Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors and/or risks. Information containing certain of these factors can be found in BancorpSouth\u2019s 2019 annual report on Form 10-K.

            "So you can certainly see where the majority \u2013 Texas and Missouri have the majority. Each of those states had about a third of the portfolio. The average loan size is small for hotels, $2.3 million. We\u2019ve only got 14 loans that are in excess of $10 million in that portfolio. And of the loans that are greater than $1 million, well over 90% of those are major flagged properties. We\u2019re seeing occupancy rates that range from relatively low and some markets to full and in other markets. Chris, you\u2019ve been talking to some of our relationship managers on that. What are you hearing?"

We saw on average, the portfolio bottom out at about 20% to 25% occupancy rates in April, and it\u2019s up to about 57%, just below 60% today. But as Dan mentioned, that\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019ve got some groups in there that will be running 20% or less and frontline 85% and 90%. It\u2019s a granular portfolio from a hotel perspective on an average loan size, as Dan mentioned, just over $2 million. We don\u2019t have a large \u2013 a lot of large hotel credits, or I would consider a lot of large and major flags and reservation systems are supporting a lot of these.",
            "And from a geographical perspective, the downtown business travel type are probably still feeling it more. The resort areas are doing pretty well. Some of the suburban hotels would be in the middle of \u2013 in between those two, is kind of what we\u2019re seeing."

We will \u2013 approximately 80% of the deferrals that we have on the first deferrals will mature are complete before the end of July. So by the end of this month, we\u2019ll have a much clearer picture than we do today. April was the month that almost all of these were put on. So it\u2019s just too early to know what\u2019s happening out there, especially depending upon what happens with the virus and whether we get a vaccine or \u2013 there\u2019s too many questions to know whether we\u2019re going to need anything, starting the beginning of next year."

You\u2019re saying a lot of the operators get creative too. So what used to be a 60 \u2013 they\u2019re able to bring their ADR and break even rates down as they staff accordingly and plan for what their occupancy rates look like.

Obviously, a big trend we\u2019ve been hearing about from the banks this earnings season is the excess liquidity and the impact of PPP loans. And I know there\u2019s very little visibility, but if you\u2019re looking out, three or so quarters, how do you see that playing out? Do you see the balance sheet kind of staying flattish over the balance of this year? And then as we\u2019re going into late this year, early into next year, PPP hopefully is getting forgiven and running off, and then at the same time, some of that excess liquidity is coming off and/or being put to work into new loans. How would you envision that playing out?"

It\u2019s really hard to see where loan growth is going to come from. Today most of our business customers are kind of waiting to see what happens to their business. Some businesses are doing quite well. So there are certainly been some winners in this process and other businesses that we\u2019ve identified are doing quite poorly. So understanding what\u2019s happening and how to take advantage of that, I think, again, I think it\u2019s just too early to tell.",
            "The liquidity that came in, the deposits, $2.3 billion in deposits flowing in a quarter, if you had told me that in April when we talked to you that we were going to see that, I probably would have argued with you. A lot of the PPP money is still here. It would certainly be helpful for us if the automatic forgiveness that Congress is talking about came into play. 89% of our PPP loans are under $150,000. So when you\u2019re talking about having to process 14,500 or today almost 15,000 forgiveness applications, that\u2019s going to be a monumental task on our part. And some of these loans are as low as you know, well under $10,000 or even under $5,000. So it\u2019d be interesting to see what happens to those loans.",
            "And then what happens to the dollars that are there? I mean, those customers, some actually need those dollars and are using them, and others have been able to hold their liquidity, as Chris said. And the stimulus money that came into the economy has been a big help too. I think at the end of the day, Kevin, I don\u2019t know that I have a direct answer that can help you figure out what\u2019s going to happen next."

And then you have that liquidity to then put to work, that\u2019s replacing maybe the proceeds that people are utilizing.",

And maybe that\u2019s a segue into my follow-up, like, PPP is the entire growth, but a few banks have mentioned commercial line utilization really ticking down, which I have to imagine is because PPP is providing them liquidity, so maybe that\u2019s just temporary.

So to have held flat in the second quarter, I think we were pleased with our ability to do that. Some of that clearly came out of the mortgage business. Mortgage is kind of obviously a home run. There is some demand out there, but it\u2019s spotty. And again, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any visibility to tell us when or what\u2019s going to happen next. Everybody\u2019s just waiting to see how \u2013 are we in a V shape? Are we in a U shape? Are we having a W shape? Everybody wants to know what\u2019s happening.

And by the end of July, 80% give or take of our first round deferrals will have matured. And right now we\u2019re only seeing less than 5% of those as they\u2019re maturing ask for a second deferral. So I would anticipate that as we get into later this month and into August, we will see significantly lower deferred balances. And as Chris said, the second round, we\u2019re asking a lot more questions for verifying liquidity. We\u2019ve said no to some people that have the ability to pay. The second round is much different than our process. Chris, you want to add into that?"

You think about when the COVID hit and the shutdown happened, remember, the banking industry, the regulatory bodies, everybody jumped in with an attitude of work with your customer, and I would even add in the accounting folks. Everybody really reached to consensus from a deferment perspective that says, it\u2019s the right thing to do, work with your customer, go out and help and do those deferments. And they put around \u2013 they put out guidance out there around what\u2019s an acceptable deferment process from a troubled debt restructuring or TDR perspective. So I think a lot of banks were operating that way.",
            "There was so much uncertainty on day one. Dan\u2019s right. We said, if we have performing customers today and that\u2019s how we approached, it was if you were performing and your loan agreement covenants were generally performing and all the \u2013 if you\u2019re a good customer today coming off 2019, we didn\u2019t have any visibility on any financial information at that time.",
            "So we took the approach of let\u2019s operate on a 90-day deferment, which was when you look back at the accounting guidance, the people, a lot of folks were doing six months, some were doing different types of deferments. And we took a more conservative approach on the first round, which many banks did, but we went to the 90-day route. And the thought was there that would give us time to get more information, be able to get more \u2013 cumulate more financial data and more facts from our customers as the calendar year went on. And then we would still be within that six-month guidance that the regulators and the accountants have put out, and we\u2019d be able to work with our customers on that second round is what we\u2019re going through today. And then you\u2019ve heard our data around \u2013 anecdotally around what the second round looks like. We\u2019re having less numbers of deferments as it stands today, and again, concentrated in some of those more impacted industries."

Chris had talked about the opportunity to lower some deposit costs. You have the liquidity, and we have the impact of PPP yields.

A good, say, 20 bps of that \u2013 the NIM came down 20 bps based on other loan repricing, some of which will continue. PPP, as I said, was five bps of that deterioration. The investment portfolio and other assets, 11 bps of the deterioration. And then going back the other way, we had 15 bps of improvement due to being able to manage our deposit and funding costs down. But we\u2019re going to continue to see pressure on the margin pressure on the margin. We\u2019ve got \u2013 over the next 12 months, we\u2019ve got almost $2.5 billion in fixed and variable rate loans that are going to be repricing. They\u2019re going to roll off at 4 75. What are those going to reprice at? They\u2019re going to reprice lower, certainly. We\u2019ve got floating rate loans of almost $3 billion, but about half of those are at floors.

Remember, it wasn\u2019t that long ago, maybe two calls ago, we were talking about excess capacity in the mortgage world, and people were laying folks off. And now it\u2019s hard to find people, and you\u2019re having to \u2013 and everybody is working 24 hours a day to meet the volume.

You\u2019re talking about branch count and branch structure. We have been challenging our branch count and branch structure. We have been challenging our branch count and our branch structure for some time. We continue to do that. When we look at our footprint, we\u2019ve \u2013 for every branch we\u2019ve closed, we\u2019ve probably opened a new one in one of the major markets that we serve.",

So, there was several million dollars in expense \u2013 many multiples of millions of dollars of expense in standing that platform up. All of that expense comes out of the direct \u2013 that\u2019s a direct cost. We won\u2019t be using that program again we\u2019re hoping. But we couldn\u2019t have made 15,000 loans in 90 days if we hadn\u2019t had that. So clearly, we spent some money and that came out of the fee. When you look at the net fee income and you add that to the 1% loan rate, you get to 2.5%."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I think when we look at just raw numbers, Will. Two of our fee lines were negatively impacted, card service fees. And at the beginning of the quarter, there wasn\u2019t anybody spending any money. That\u2019s clearly part of the deposit growth. None of us were spending money on gasoline. We weren\u2019t going out to eat. We weren\u2019t going on vacation. Therefore most people that were fortunate enough to maintain their employment, their checking account balances were growing, but at the same time they weren\u2019t using their card. So card service fees were certainly off, higher balances leads to lower deposit service charges, we certainly waived a lot more fees in the quarter than we have been in the past.",
            "Hopefully we will see that start to dwindle off. When you\u2019re looking at transaction, our volume is holding in there, but the fee per click continues to tighten up. So I don\u2019t have a quick answer for that. I\u2019d like to see the card volume come back and people would be able to spend money. I think certainly the electronic payments that are out there when you look at what\u2019s happening, we\u2019re seeing that the number of card transactions continues to roll up while our paper transactions continues to go down. And so that should benefit us in card revenue in the long-haul, but we\u2019re still seeing compressed or depressed transaction counts because of the pandemic."

            "Yes. Again, I think that depends upon what Congress does. I mean, when we look out at what\u2019s there, I would suspect that the large majority of our customers will apply for forgiveness. Again, when you look at the average ticket size of $86,000, Chris, I think we plan on most of those customers asking for forgiveness, if the bill passes that\u2019s sitting in Congress today that makes forgiveness a simple attestation for anybody under whatever number they pick 150 is the current talk, that represents 89% of our loan count. That\u2019s only a little less than 40% of the dollar balance, but that would be a big pickup in time, energy effort and expense on our side to process all of that.",
            "The bigger loans, by giving the folks 24 weeks to spend the money we could easily be into the next year before we see some of that. Just looking forward, the rules today, if we were to accept an application today for forgiveness, July the 21st, we\u2019ve got some time to process it. So let\u2019s assume we can process it in 10 or 15 days and we submit that application to the SBA for forgiveness at the beginning of August, well, the SBA has 60 days to do that, and there\u2019s no penalty if they take longer than that. So I expect we will see virtually no forgiveness in this quarter, and hopefully we will see some fairly significant forgiveness in the fourth quarter. But until those \u2013 there is more clarity on how that\u2019s going to work, it\u2019s still today. The SBA has not stood up their process on how to even submit an application for forgiveness. So we can\u2019t even submit an application for forgiveness today."

The bigger increase or the upward pressure was from a pre-COVID not COVID related purchased credits in Texas. We don\u2019t anticipate a loss in those, that combined with, the courthouse has shut down too, and everybody basically paused foreclosure for 90 days, so that\u2019s just your normal cycle of credits that you would normally work through, that were not \u2013 they were already \u2013 we were already taking action prior to COVID really kind of pause. So it\u2019s a combination of a couple of large credits that we feel like we have a good exit strategy on and a general overall slowing of ability to work through some of the problem credits across the footprint is communities and courthouses and collection efforts paused."

Again, I think 2020 is going to be relatively low impact when you\u2019re talking about net charge-offs, even today the likelihood of a significant run-up in non-performers in this quarter, I put as relatively low from the pandemic, by the end of July we\u2019ll be down to less than 10% of the first round deferrals still in place.",
            "If we stick with the small number of folks that are asking for a second round, then the likelihood of folks being 90 days late coming into October or even November is relatively low. So today it looks like 2020 isn\u2019t going to have a whole lot of significant credit charge-offs because of the pandemic, because of the time that it takes to get to a charge-off status. So it\u2019s a 2021 event. We may be able to have some clarity on credit quality in the way of nonperforming assets coming in by the end of the year for the fourth quarter. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll have a whole lot of that by the end of the third quarter, and the train is coming through again as usual for our calls.

So certainly those relationships are all there, valuing a loan portfolio in today\u2019s environment is just difficult.
