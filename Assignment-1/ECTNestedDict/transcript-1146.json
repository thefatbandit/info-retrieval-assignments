      "Herna Verhagen": [
         "Thanks. Thanks for joining, and I would like to start on Slide 4. Where we give \u2013 where we make a clear point that we\u2019re proud on our people, they delivered a very exceptional performance over the last three to four months, in which we were able to do almost more than 25% more parcels. We\u2019ve taken lots of measures immediately after the first COVID signals in the Netherlands appeared, and that gave us a head start. Of course, sick leave increased, especially in the beginning, and now we\u2019re back to normal levels. We do think that the exceptional performance of all our 50,000 people have, in the end, delivered exceptional results, and those we will present on the next slides.",
         "Then I\u2019ll move to Slide number 5. In which I take you through the key takeaways of the second quarter and the first half year. We showed a very strong performance, which is driven by the volume growth at Parcels, and that delivered a normalized EBIT, which is expected to be, for the full year, strongly above the initially guided range of \u20ac110 million to \u20ac130 million. This also brings a strong improvement in free cash flow. The normalized EBIT in the second quarter is up 38% from \u20ac39 million last year Q2 to \u20ac54 million this year. With a significant improvement in cash flow, of \u20ac86 million to a cash flow of \u20ac93 million in the second quarter.",
         "We were able to deliver these results because of the scaled up capacity at Parcels with 40%, which we did by the end of March and April. To be sure that we will be able to also deliver, of course, the growth in parcels we still expect going forward, we keep our investments of around \u20ac150 million for the year 2020 to 2022 to further expansion of parcels, and we are on track with these. And of course, we are proud on the realization of the anticipated benefits and synergies of the mail network, and we are ahead of plan.",
         "We also showed progress towards emission-free last mile delivery in the Benelux in 2030, and we started to replace our petrol scooters with electrical three-wheel scooters. A very strong business model, which demonstrated under very challenging circumstances to be able to deliver the results.",
         "If we move to Slide 6. Let\u2019s look into the financial highlights. The Q2 result, which we qualify as a strong performance, is achieved in an extraordinary quarter. The revenue was up 15% with \u20ac107 million to \u20ac789 million. The normalized EBIT increased by \u20ac15 million and came in at \u20ac54 million. The underlying normalized EBIT is even significantly better, and Pim will highlight that in his part of the presentation. At the same time, we saw a strong improvement for free cash flow that came in at \u20ac93 million positive. We expect full year normalized EBIT to be strongly above the initially guided range of \u20ac110 million to \u20ac130 million. And let me add to that that the uncertainties about the duration and severity of the COVID pandemic may impact our ability to achieve these results. At Parcels since mid-March, we see a strong development.",
         "Volumes are growing double digit, and this is supported by a positive price/mix effect, and I\u2019m also very pleased with the progress of the integration of Sandd, which is ahead of plan in realizing the anticipated benefits and synergies. Looking at the composition of the kneel back on our mail delivery since mid-March, we see much more greeting cards. That has a favorable impact on price/mix development. However, we also saw lower direct mail activity as businesses decided to postpone their marketing efforts, resulting in additional volume decline.",
         "I already discussed the measures taken related to the health and safety guidelines for COVID-19. These had some impact on the cost level in the quarter. So all in all, normalized EBIT for the quarter came in at \u20ac54 million. And let me emphasize that this includes higher pension expenses and the impact of new labor regulation, as indicated before.",
         "What we did see, and then I\u2019m on Slide 7, what we did see in the second quarter is also a further growth of the digitization. And it underpins the importance we\u2019ve given digitization into our business. Digitization is one of the pillars of our strategy, and this slide shares with you some main developments in the second quarter. The growing importance of digitization helps us in serving our customers and will improve efficiency.",
         "First of all, during the first half of 2020, we had 274 million online visitors, a growth of 38%. And good to mention is that 57% at this moment in time of these figures has reached us via the app. That\u2019s the second very important digital lever for PostNL. The amount of PostNL accounts in our app, it increased by 22% to 5.5 million at this moment in time, and it keeps growing with around 30,000 unique accounts a week. We also see very strong growth in one of our latest innovations in Mail, the stamp code, it\u2019s very often used, 70% more than in the second quarter last year, especially during the COVID crisis. And of course, we serve lots of people via our chatbot Daan, an enormous increase has been reached in the second quarter. These developments illustrate the efforts were taken to further digitalize our business. An acceleration of becoming even more digital remains one of our key priorities for 2020 and the years ahead.",
         "And on Slide number 8, we show you one of the examples. With the extra investments we do in digitization, we, for example, offer to customers the opportunity to get their parcel standard delivered at a different location than their home address. It\u2019s one of the pilots we do today, and what we do think is that this will meet a new customer demand and a new consumer demand. It\u2019s only one of the examples of what we\u2019ve done over the last half year to further digitize our business. Then over to some more details. What actually happened in our business segments in the first half year and, of course, especially in the second quarter.",
         "On Slide number 11, we talk about Parcels. And we see that the volume growth boosted the normalized EBIT in an extraordinary quarter. We did see a strong revenue growth partly because of the fact that COVID-19 resulted in extra growth in e-commerce, partly because we do see that the growth is, of course, with our big customers, but also with small and mid-sized web shops, which has a positive impact on our yields. Next to that, we\u2019ve taken lots of yield measures as we presented last year in May 2019. We see very strong revenue growth in Spring, Asia and Europe, and of course, what we do think is that the acceleration we do see in e-commerce will maintain until the end of the year. All by all, volume growth was 24.8% in the second quarter. It was a high-growth in April and May and around 18% growth in the month of June.",
         "It is delivered at almost doubling of the normalized EBIT, \u20ac29 million in Q2 2019 to \u20ac60 million in Q2 2020. What helped us enormously next to, of course, scaling up the capacity by 40%, which enabled us to deliver all those parcels, is that we had an almost equal flow across the week, which is different from a normal pattern, and this helped us enormously in winning efficiency. Next to that, we did see improving business performance, both in logistics and in spring. All by all, an extraordinary quarter with very good results within Parcels.",
         "On Slide 12, we come back to an earlier promise, in which we did say that we want to reach a better balance between volume and capacity. What we did see is that the strong volume growth did drive higher efficiency and also did drive margin growth. The significant improvement in yield management and operational efficiency was part because of the growth in small and medium business accounts, part because of price measures, which were already taken in 2019. But also because of equal flow and an improved hit rate. More people are working from home, which gave us the opportunity, of course, to deliver parcels at home much more frequently than we were used to. The flexible infrastructure we\u2019ve built over the last few years gave us the opportunity to scale up our capacity with 40% in almost 4 weeks. And we added also new cross-dock locations, for example, in Zaltbommel, to enable us to deliver all parcels necessary.",
         "We will continue to expand capacity also in the second half year of 2020. And of course, we will follow-up our investment program of around \u20ac150 million, which we will spend in the year 2020 to 2022 to even increase our capacity also further on. For example, by opening our innovative sorting center for small parcels, which is on track and will be opened in 2021, but also two new depots, one in Belgium and one in the Netherlands, one additional joint fulfillment center together with Bol also in 2021. And of course, a further expansion of our retail network and the introduction of self-service propositions. Yield management, together with operational measures, a flexible network and, of course, a very flexible and dedicated people delivered a very good business performance.",
         "Then let\u2019s move to Slide 13, where we talk about Mail in the Netherlands. The result is impacted by the additional volume decline related to COVID-19. What you see over here is that within Mail Netherlands, we have a revenue increase from \u20ac380 million last year to \u20ac393 million this year. That is, of course, of the integration of Sandd, it\u2019s because of also a positive price/mix effect. And of course, we also lost revenue because of the volume decline. Volume decline was 16.2%. It is an additional substitution due to COVID of around 5%, and we see impact of elections, which we had in 2019, which we do not have at this moment in time. which is a 1.9% impact. If you deduct that, that means that volume decline is still within the bandwidth of 8% to 10%, which is our normal substitution rate.",
         "Normalized EBIT was around \u2013 was \u20ac5 million, which is \u20ac12 million lower than last year. This includes a realization of our benefits and synergies of the combination of the mail networks, which is ahead of plan, where we realized in Q2, \u20ac15 million. And over the first half year of 2020, we realized in benefits and synergies, a total amount of \u20ac20 million. We have to take into account that we did, of course, sell PCS and Spotta and we discontinued also the distribution of unaddressed mail. The net contribution of Sandd in normalized EBIT asset was \u20ac15 million. It\u2019s ahead of plan, and we will highlight a little bit of where we are in the integration on Slide number 14.",
         "We did the acquisition of Sandd last year October 2019. By that time, we already had a very detailed and well prepared implementation and integration plan. We immediately started the integration of the two networks, which we finalized on February 1 this year. So already since February 1, we have two fully integrated networks. The integration was necessary to make sure that we could maintain quality going forward and that we could maintain a good and reachable network in the whole of the Netherlands. Next to that, we did close down the physical infrastructure of Sandd. We ended lease contracts for cars, scooters, et cetera, et cetera. And that means that the full integration costs in the second half year of 2020 are very limited.",
         "Next to the integration of the two networks, we also put attention and laid attention to certain points, which we still had to do, for example, an agreement with the union, FNV for compensation of former Sandd mail deliverers, and of course, Dutch government and PostNL have appealed against the court decision that announced the earlier approval granted for consolidation.",
         "I would summarize it as we\u2019re ahead of plan and delivering the anticipated benefits and synergies with a run rate of \u20ac50 million to \u20ac60 million as of 2022. And as said, we\u2019re ahead of plan for that.",
         "On Slide 15, we talk about cost saving projects. As we did say when we did the acquisition of Sandd is that we had a certain delay in cost saving projects because we had to do the integration first and that had some delay on our cost savings. That\u2019s what we see in the numbers, first half year, but what we will see in the numbers of the second half year. Secondly, what we do see is that COVID has an impact on cost savings. And for example, which is a little bit more difficult because of the social distancing we have to maintain, is the closing of our of our distribution locations and then the centralization to our sourcing locations, for example, that is limited \u2013 there\u2019s limited possibility at this moment in time. So there, we have a little delay in our cost savings.",
         "The new mail route remains to be a very important step going forward. And there, we do see an optimization of sorting and automation processes and also with a 30% step-up in volume. We see expansion of routes, we see larger contracts for our mail deliverer, which remains to be important also for our employees. We will use more e-bikes in here, and the results of the pilot have led to adjustments in the design. And of course, we will continue with the overhead reduction, which is still in line with the earlier plans. The strong delay due to the measures taken to apply social distancing guidelines in operations and facilities, and that will be seen, especially in the second half year of 2020.",
         "An example of those electrical scooters issue is what you find on Slide number 15. There you see the effects towards emission-free-last-mile delivery in the Benelux. It will be fully implemented by the midst of 2021. It will save, of course, tons in CO2 annually, and it\u2019s also an important part of our new mail route, where our mail deliverers will have longer delivery routes and these vehicles will enable them to take all the mail which they have to deliver with them. First, vehicles are driving now in the Netherlands, and people are proud to drive an electrical scooter of PostNL.",
         "Then over to Slide 16, where we give you an outlook for the full year 2020. We expect further volume growth at Parcels at a more moderate pace than in Q2. And the angle or the arrow gives you an indication of what we think the second half year will look like if you compare it to the first half year. We will scale up our capacity further to accommodate the higher volumes towards the second half of the year. Within Mail, we expect substitution because of COVID-19 to slow down. We expect also to be successful in the combination of the mail networks and realize asset our benefits and synergies, and we see some delay in cost-saving initiatives because of Sandd integration and a delay because of COVID-19.",
         "The sum of all these together will deliver for the full-year, 2020, a normalized EBIT that is expected to be strongly above the \u20ac110 million to \u20ac130 million, which translates also in a strong improvement in cash flow. And what we remain to say is that the uncertainties around the global impact of COVID-19 seem to increase and also creates, of course, some uncertainty. And all by all, we\u2019re confident in our ability to deliver a very solid full-year 2020 performance.",
         "And for the financial overview for the second quarter and half year 2020, I\u2019ll hand over to Pim."
      ],
      "Jochem van de Laarschot": [
         "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me in the room, Herna Verhagen our CEO; and Pim Berendsen, our CFO. We will first start with a presentation. And after that, they will take your questions. Herna, over to you.",
         "Operator, could you start this part of the meeting, please?"
      ],
      "Operator": [
         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding, and welcome to the PostNL Q2 half year results analyst call.",
         "[Operator Instructions] I\u2019d like to hand over the conference to Mr. Jochem van de Laarschot. Go ahead, please, sir."
      ],
      "Pim Berendsen": [
         "Thank you, Herna. Now let\u2019s look at some more of the financial details in, indeed, what has been an extraordinary quarter for PostNL on very many accounts. If you look at Slide 18, we will see the reconciliation of Parcels' results, actually, nearly doubling the results in the quarter from \u20ac29 million normalized EBIT last year to \u20ac60 million normalized EBIT in this year. And if you adjust for the new labor regulation, \u20ac2 million, like-for-like, it\u2019s actually \u20ac62 million for the quarter. Of course, that\u2019s driven, to a large extent, by the increase in revenue because of the 24.8% volume growth. But next to that, as well, the yield measures and the mix effects in customer base have supported the overall revenue and profit development.",
         "Organic costs, as expected, and volume dependent cost, of course, are a function, together with the other cost of the efficiency levels Herna talked about and do include some efficiency improvements as well as additional IT and retail costs to accommodate the higher volume growth. It also includes slightly lower performance of International because of lower import streams also due to COVID 19. Then the other result is \u20ac14 million up. This is, to a large extent, driven by higher and better performance of both Spring and our Logistic solutions parts and it does include a \u20ac4 million impairment of the fair value adjustment of the intangibles of PS Nachtdistributie, which is one of the parts of our Logistics business. All in all, a very good performance of Parcels in this quarter.",
         "If we then dive into the normalized EBIT development of Mail, and that\u2019s on slide 19. Normalized EBIT came down from \u20ac17 million to \u20ac5 million in the quarter. And as Herna already said, this includes \u20ac15 million of synergies as a consequence of the integration of the networks of Sandd. This development is, of course, heavily influenced by the additional consolidation revenues being \u20ac34 million in the quarter, but obviously also by the 16.2% volume decline, of which roughly 2% relates \u2013 3% relates to elections and working day effects, 5% roughly relates to wake of COVID-19 acceleration of volume decline, which we have seen, notably in the direct marketing arena, where bigger retailers have postponed their campaigns.",
         "If we look at the June developments, we already see an improvement on this level, particularly direct mail volume declining significantly less than the 16% for the full quarter. Of course, we\u2019ve seen, particularly in March and April, predominantly April, a higher level of single items, which in volume developments don\u2019t contribute that much, but obviously, supports the very positive price/mix development that you see of \u20ac21 million on this slide.",
         "Organic cost, volume dependent cost, nothing special. If you look at the other costs, that is a function of the additional integration cost of Sandd. So if the net contribution is \u20ac15 million, the gross contribution of synergies is \u20ac21 million because it includes \u20ac6 million of integration costs as well as higher IT expenses and restructuring related costs. Very important also to understand in comparison to last year is that we\u2019ve a spin-off PCS, Spotta and discontinued our unaddressed activities. Slightly more than half of the other result development of this \u20ac10 million relates to PCS, Spotta and unaddressed.",
         "The other half relates to other parts of the Mail segment, amongst others are direct marketing, let\u2019s say, online marketing activities as well as our international business that have declined in comparison to last year. Then we move to the second key metric, the free cash flow development in this quarter. And there, we see a very strong improvement in comparison to last year. We\u2019ve ended the quarter on a \u20ac93 million cash flow generation, which is \u20ac86 million more than the same quarter last year. There\u2019s a few important elements that I would like to address. If you look at the level of CapEx in this quarter, and actually, if you look at the level of CapEx in the first half of the year, it is low, but also as we expected.",
         "So for the remainder of the year, we expect a step-up in CapEx levels close to the lower end of the bandwidth that we\u2019ve guided for \u20ac100 million and \u20ac120 million for the full year. And of course, that step-up in CapEx relates to a large extent, to the increase in capacity and Parcels, preparing for 2021, being the small parcel sorting center, Belgium, cross-docks as well as investments to accommodate the new mail route so in comparison to the first half, we\u2019ll see a big step-up in CapEx in the second half of the year as said towards the lower end of the bandwidth \u20ac100 million to \u20ac120 million.",
         "If you look at the change in working capital in this quarter, actually a release, so not an investment in working capital, but a release in working capital, if you look at that difference between the quarters, half of the difference, so roughly the \u20ac35 million, is phasing towards the second part of the year. And again, if we look back at what we\u2019ve guided for in the beginning of the year, we expect also an improvement in comparison to the roughly \u20ac65 million to \u20ac75 million investment in working capital that we guided in the beginning of the year, much more closer to how we\u2019ve ended the year on 2019. So very happy with the performance of free cash flow, albeit that this quarter is a bit influenced by phasing effects predominantly in working capital and CapEx will increase in the second part of the year.",
         "Now stepping over to pensions. The coverage ratio of the 12-month average of the pension fund is at 105.7% at the end of June. The actual coverage ratio is at 102.5%, which still is above the threshold of the recovery level at 104% and obviously, below the 104%, the resilience of the fund itself will come into play. And as such, we do not expect any top-up payments in 2020.",
         "On the right-hand side of the slide, you see reflected the pension agreement that we already shared with you and the market before. So roughly \u20ac85 \u2013 roughly \u20ac100 million lower cash out on pensions, \u20ac15 million being the improvement, both in terms of lower transitional pension payments as well as \u20ac5 million lower regular contributions and \u20ac85 million will be postponed to the later years in five equal installments.",
         "And as I said, this is an improvement of partially leverage because it helps us for, let\u2019s say, \u20ac15 million in the net debt calculation. But from a liquidity point of view, it helps us significantly more than that. And of course, the entitlements of the employees themselves have not been affected.",
         "And important to look at the balance sheet and a couple of points on Slide 22. First and foremost, the adjusted net debt by the end of June is \u20ac614 million. And that came down from \u20ac699 million by the end of the first quarter. So \u20ac85 million improvement on the adjusted net debt. If you then take account of the comments I just made on the free cash flow, the expectation should be that the adjusted net debt will increase towards the end of the year. Now obviously, an increase of EBIT. But as I said, an acceleration of the CapEx spend in the second half of the year and ultimately, a release of working capital in the first half year will change to an investment in working capital for the full year.",
         "Another component to note is that the total comprehensive income for the quarter ended at \u20ac37 million. Of course, the comprehensive income is the relevant profit metric for our dividend policy, and also good to note that the total equity on this balance sheet has turned positive to \u20ac31 million from minus \u20ac7 million by the end of the first quarter.",
         "If we then look at the outlook or more specifically the attention points for the development of normalized EBIT for the second half of the year, the graph on the right-hand side on Slide 24 gives you a relative division of the contribution of the quarters towards the normalized EBIT. And there you\u2019ll see that Q3 will deliver a result which is somewhere below Q2 and higher than Q1, and Q4 obviously contributes the most to the normalized EBIT. And as we said before, the second half of the year contributes more than half of the results. Also important to understand that in Q4 last year, negative contribution of the consolidation was reported.",
         "And as a consequence, you should expect an improvement of the normalized EBIT in Q4 in comparison to last year. What we\u2019ve assumed for the volume growth of Parcels is what Herna already talked about. So we\u2019ll expect Parcels to continue to grow and to continue to grow at a higher pace than what we see half year but slightly lower than the pace that we\u2019ve seen in Q2. We do expect that, let\u2019s say, the additional substitution effect on direct mail as a consequence of COVID-19 will improve. First signs, first deltas were visible in June. We already see some of the bigger direct marketing campaigns coming back, but still early days, but we do expect an improvement of the substitution rate in the second half of the year. Better price/mix still to be expected, but not as pronounced as we\u2019ve seen in the first part of the year, predominantly because of the step-up in single items that is returned back to normal on the mail side of the business.",
         "Of course, as we\u2019ve guided for in the beginning of the year, also in the next quarters, you should expect higher pension expenses and higher costs because of the new labor regulation, of roughly \u20ac8 million a quarter. And as I said, we\u2019ll continue to deliver upon the synergy ambitions of the integration of the networks. But because of COVID-19, we do expect a delay in the realization of some of the cost-saving initiatives in the mail side. Yes. And I said, if you talk about free cash flow, we talked about that already quite extensively a step-up in CapEx and another development of working capital, turning it into an investment rather of a release of working capital.",
         "If we then go to the outlook for 2020. And as said, visibility for the second half of the year remains limited. If we look around ourselves, of course, there\u2019s \u2013 each and every day new developments around COVID-19, we are very much confident that, let\u2019s say, we are able to deliver a normalized EBIT strongly above \u20ac110 million to \u20ac130 million. And that strong improvement on EBIT follows through towards the free cash flow in comparison to the \u20ac215 million to minus \u20ac185 million that we\u2019ve guided for before.",
         "Confident in the ability to deliver a very strong performance, definitely, albeit that remains a little bit lack of visibility and uncertainty around the implications of COVID-19 for the remainder of the year.",
         "On free cash flow, around \u20ac100 million related to the final agreement on transitional pensions. And as said, only \u20ac15 million of that \u20ac100 million affects net debt positively. A further upside is anticipated as a consequence of the improved normalized EBIT above the initially guided range that will convert into cash. And working capital investments should be lower than anticipated and guided before by the end of Q4 due to strict working capital management, and also good working capital management offsets the higher revenue developments, predominantly in Parcels as well.",
         "So very strong performance half year on very many accounts, both in terms of cash flow, on normalized EBIT, on comprehensive income, and of course, next to that, very much happy that we\u2019ve managed to conclude the agreement with the pension fund and that we\u2019ve managed to complete the transaction on Nexive. And confident to be able to deliver strongly above the \u20ac110 million to \u20ac130 million for the year. That concludes my part of the presentation. So Jochem, I think we can now open up for Q&A."

So I think we\u2019re in our fifth year of decline of 8% to 10&, and many of the countries around that as they only are starting to have substitution rates, which is 6%, 7% or 8%.

So that is a run rate of \u20ac21 million in the quarter. If you look at the half year, then you can add \u20ac5 million to the \u20ac15 million as the net contribution. So halfway through the year, net contribution is \u20ac20 million. And we expect that, again, as we said, the original range was \u20ac50 million to \u20ac60 million, which we expect to outperform.",
            "At this moment in time, we refrain from giving more guidance than that, and we actually look to deliver the results, and then it will be clearer and clearer over time. If we talk about the guidance or what kept us from giving a \u2013 another type of guidance, in our view, we did give a guidance by saying that 20% to 30% improvement on the back of the old range actually gives you a range. If I look at the consensus that you guys, as analysts, together have made I think we have been very clear in that because where you are with your full-year guidance is, let\u2019s say, what otherwise would have been a range in numbers.",
            "So in our view, there\u2019s no misunderstanding about what our guidance is. And as such, no reason to change the way we give that guidance. And that \u2013 both in terms of EBIT and in cash flow. The depreciation and amortization is a similar comparable towards the number that we\u2019ve given in the beginning of the year, which was \u20ac170 million for depreciation and amortization together. It might be slightly below that, but comparable, I would say. No big deviation."

Think about, for example, Extra@Home, which delivers our heavy material, but also cargo, and within Spring, we did see an uplift in e-commerce, especially coming from Asia and the other countries in Europe. We expect trends to continue in the second half year. And hopefully, when there will be no second lockdown because of corona, also first improvements again in B2B delivery."

The one-off in there of \u20ac6 million, but there were also some, I think, some restructuring charges and IT related costs in there. Doesn\u2019t that mean that those are not one-off and that we should not work with a run rate of \u20ac21 million or is the run rate even slightly higher because that only adjusts for the one-off cost? And seems perhaps, again, sorry, for the question on the synergies. But I just want to get\u2026"

So as a consequence, the run rate is the \u20ac21 million we talked about. What does happen, of course, that if you take the additional volume of Sandd, you will not only add some volume-dependent cost only, but also some additional volume-independent cost. But let\u2019s say, the way we presented the business case over the last quarters consistently is the run rate synergies minus the integration costs actually required to integrate the networks and to build down the existing former Sandd network."

So if you look at, let\u2019s say, the division of the \u20ac150 million, so to speak, so this is the group.
