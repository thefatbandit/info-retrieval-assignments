      "Charles Albright": [
         "Thanks, Cindy and thanks, everyone for joining the call today. I\u2019ll start with our in vivo editing medicines which constitute the first pillar or therapeutic strategy. Earlier this year, we were proud to report dosing of the first patient with an in vivo CRISPR medicine, with dosing of EDIT-101 in the BRILLIANCE clinical trial.",
         "On our last call, we shared that the first six weeks of safety data from the first patient dose supported dosing with the second patient. We\u2019re pleased to report today that the first patient remains stable following their three-month follow-up evaluation. We look forward to dosing more patients presenting additional clinical data of EDIT-101 in the near future.",
         "Following EDIT-101, our next ocular program is EDIT-102 for Usher Syndrome type 2A. With the termination of our agreement with Allergan, we will transition manufacturing processes and materials from Allergan to Editas to advance this program into IND-enabling studies. We are expanding our in vivo pipeline to indications beyond ocular using our knowledge from our ocular programs. As previously disclosed, we\u2019re collaborating with AskBio in a neurology program.",
         "Switching to engineered cell medicines, the other strategic pillar of our therapeutic strategy. We are encouraged with our progress without EDIT-301 potentially best-in-class medicine for hemoglobinopathies. EDIT-301 remains on track for an IND filing for sickle cell disease this year.",
         "As a reminder, EDIT-301 increases fetal hemoglobin by leveraging our proprietary Cas12a to edit the beta-globin locus of the site or naturally occurring human mutations, increased fetal hemoglobin and suppressed sickle cell disease symptoms. The human genetic support for our approach decreases potential safety risks.",
         "Importantly, this human genetic support does not exist for the BC11A enhancer site. Further, our approach induces more fetal hemoglobin in preclinical studies and editing at the BC11A enhancer region. We believe this increased fetal hemoglobin will translate into improved efficacy in the clinic.",
         "We presented preclinical proof-of-concept and an oral presentation at the EHA. In this presentation, we showed we could efficiently edit hematopoietic stem cells from sickle cell disease patients and that these edited cells had improved properties indicative of reduced sickling propensity.",
         "Further, we showed cells from healthy donor derived hematopoietic stem cells were maintained in vivo in an elevated and pan-cellular fetal hemoglobin expression, following EDIT-301 treatment. These data add to our package supporting the best-in-class potential of EDIT-301. For these reasons, we are eager to test at a 301 in the clinic and remain on track to file an IND for sickle cell disease this year.",
         "In preparation for this Phase 1/2 trial, we\u2019ve identified the lead Principal Investigator engaged to CRO begun site selection and are planning an investigator meeting in the fourth quarter. Further, our recent agreement with Azzur provides the necessary infrastructure to manufacture the clinical trial material.",
         "As we have shared, Editas is growing its investment in oncology. Cell-based medicines have shown transformational activity and liquid tumors. The major unmet need though exists in solid tumors where we aim to develop differentiated off-the-shelf medicines.",
         "Our proprietary editing capabilities positioned us uniquely to deliver on our vision for oncology. We\u2019ve made substantial progress with our lead candidate EDIT-201, a healthy donor derived allogeneic NK cell medicine for the treatment of solid tumors. We continue our IND-enabling studies.",
         "As part of these efforts, our collaboration with Sandhill has accelerated the acquisition and expansion of healthy donor NK cells. We intend to present updated preclinical data from this program in a scientific congress later this year.",
         "We also continue to advance our engineered iPSC-derived NK cell medicine program, recently presenting in vitro data at ASGCT. These data show that our CRISPR/Cas12a editing platform enhanced iPSC-derived NK cell tumor killing properties and support the transformative potential of these cells as an office shelf medicine.",
         "We believe these treatments can be an important new treatment option that explores the intrinsic properties of NK cells, while avoiding the side effects of T cell therapies such as Graft versus Host and cytokine release syndrome. Our lead experimental medicine will contain multiple genetic changes, and we\u2019ll provide further updates on this program later in the year.",
         "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Michelle Robertson."
      ],
      "Cindy Collins": [
         "Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, and thank you everyone for joining us for our corporate update call for the second quarter of 2020. In addition to Mark, I am joined by; Charles Albright, our Chief Scientific Officer; and Michelle Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer.",
         "The second quarter of 2020 has been an important period for the advancement of our pioneering gene editing programs, continuation of building out the development organization and CMC and strengthening the balance sheet. All of this leaves us well positioned to continue to revolutionize the treatments for genetic blindness, cancer, sickle cell disease and neurological condition.",
         "Our momentum is even more significant, given the considerable challenges we and the broader scientific community are still facing with the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. I am proud of our team whose dedication and implementation of a robust business continuity plan has enabled us to remain on track with the guidance we shared last quarter.",
         "I would now like to review some of our key recent accomplishments. As Mark mentioned, we are thrilled to regain full control of our ocular medicine, including EDIT-101, the first in vivo CRISPR medicine to be administered to patients. Our 2017 agreement with Allergan has been terminated and we have entered into a new agreement with AbbVie that returns development and commercialization rights for ocular medicines to Editas.",
         "Over the coming months, we will transition activities previously carried out by Allergan, including regulatory and clinical activities, as well as manufacturing activities for EDIT-101 and EDIT-102 to Editas. Additionally, we will purchase inventory for EDIT-101 and EDIT-102 programs and add staff in clinical development, research, manufacturing and quality.",
         "For our lead program EDIT-101 for LCA10, we will resume dosing in the Phase 1/2 BRILLIANCE clinical trial now that sites have been cleared to dose patients after the COVID-19 related costs. We remain on track to complete the adult low-dose and dose at least one patient in the adult mid-dose cohort by the end of this year.",
         "I am pleased to report that we are continuing to progress our differentiated engineered cell medicines for cancer and hemoglobinopathies. We remain on track for filing our IND by the end of the year for EDIT-301, our cell medicine for sickle cell disease. We have identified the lead investigator as well as our CRO and are beginning to identify clinical sites.",
         "We continue to advance IND-enabling studies for our lead oncology candidate, EDIT-201, an allogeneic, healthy donor NK cell medicine for the treatment of solid tumors. Additionally, we continue to advance our iPSC-derived NK programs for solid tumors as well.",
         "We believe our proprietary Cas12a engineering for both our healthy donor and iPSC-derived NK cell medicine will propel Editas to generate transformative cell medicines for solid tumors, an area with a pressing unmet need for innovative treatment solution. As we advance our pipeline towards the clinic, we continue to build our manufacturing capabilities, both internally and externally.",
         "To support this robust pipeline in the years ahead, we recently announced two important agreements. We signed a multiyear lease agreement for our cleanroom space with Azzur to perform preclinical and early phase clinical manufacturing activities for our engineered cell medicines. Editas\u2019 employees perform all manufacturing and analytical co-work.",
         "Securing dedicated GMP manufacturing space to support the development of our cell medicines including EDIT-301 and EDIT-201 and our iNK program provides us with needed flexibility and control as we advance these programs into the clinic.",
         "We also entered into a strategic partnership with Catalent, who will provide critical manufacturing infrastructure and support from their facilities in Baltimore, Houston and Philadelphia. Catalent\u2019s integrated support will include supplying raw material, viral vectors and engineered cell medicine production, as well as storage and distribution of finished product for clinical trials.",
         "Lastly, we continue to build out our manufacturing facility in Boulder to manufacture guide RNA. On the organizational front, we onboarded 18 employees over the past quarter, primarily in development and CMC to continue to advance our programs toward the clinic.",
         "At the executive level, we hired a Chief Business Officer, Gad Berdugo, who has more than 25 years of experience in biotech, and we continue our search for a Chief Medical Officer. We could not accomplish any of this without the support of our investors.",
         "Our recent offering of common stock resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $216 million. These funds significantly strengthen our balance sheet, enabling the continued development of our best-in-class in vivo and engineered cell medicine pipeline, while demonstrating the continued confidence among the investment community in our strategic approach and execution. We thank you.",
         "With that overview, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Scientific Officer, Charlie Albright to discuss additional pipeline updates.",
         "Thank you, Michelle. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the dedication from the leadership, employees and trusted partners at Editas, who have enabled tremendous clinical, scientific and corporate progress, despite the challenges that remain from COVID-19.",
         "We are incredibly excited to advance the two pillars of Editas to provide differentiated CRISPR medicines that have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of genetic blindness, cancer, sickle cell disease and neurological diseases.",
         "As the first and only company to treat a patient with an in vivo CRISPR gene editing medicine, we look forward to further strengthening our position as the leader in the space with additional programs advancing to the clinic and our expansion to broader indications beyond ocular.",
         "We are also excited with our progress in engineered cell medicines, where our differentiated Cas12a editing has generated in vivo proof-of-concept preclinical data in our hemoglobinopathies and oncology programs. Our recent manufacturing agreements enable the continuation of our rapid progress across these programs.",
         "We will continue our efforts to expand the reach of gene editing across our platform and look forward to significant organizational velocity in partnership with our employees, partners, shareholders, physicians, and, of course, patients. We thank all of you for your continued interest and support.",
         "With that, we will open up the call for Q&A. Operator?"
      ],
      "Mark Mullikin": [
         "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2020 conference call. Earlier this afternoon, we issued two press releases. The first press release announces the termination of our agreement with Allergan for the development of ocular medicines, returning full control of these programs to Editas Medicine. The second press release provides our financial results and corporate updates for the second quarter of 2020.",
         "A replay of today\u2019s call will be available on the Investors section of our website approximately two hours after its completion. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. As a reminder, various remarks that we make during this call about the company\u2019s future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.",
         "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is on file with the SEC. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today, and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. Except as required by law, we specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, even if our views change.",
         "Now, I will turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Cindy Collins."
      ],
      "Michelle Robertson": [
         "Thank you, Charlie and good afternoon, everyone. Editas remains in strong financial position as we advanced our programs forward. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30th, 2020 were $598.7 million, compared to $415 million as of March 31st, 2020. The increase was largely due to the $203.7 million in net proceeds raised from the company\u2019s recent equity offering.",
         "The proceeds we raised from our recent equity offering have strengthened our balance sheet and we expect our current cash balance will fund our operating plan into 2023. We are well positioned to continue execution across our clinical and preclinical pipeline, funding both our ongoing BRILLIANCE trial and also enabling the advancement of additional in vivo and ex vivo candidate into the clinic. The use of proceeds includes further build out of the development organization, enhancement of our CMC and analytical capabilities and the advancement of all of our programs.",
         "Now, I\u2019d like to review our income statement for the second quarter of 2020. Revenue was $10.7 million compared to $2.3 million for the same period last year. Revenue in the current quarter includes $7.6 million in cash revenues received in connection with an out-license agreement.",
         "Total operating expenses were $42.1 million, net of non-cash stock compensation expense of $5.4 million, compared to $38 million for the same period last year. Research and development expenses were $28 million compared to $23.6 million for the same period last year. The increase in our R&D expenses was primarily attributable to the expansion of our development organization. External expenses related to IND enabling studies for our EDIT-301 program and non-recurring fees related to licensing.",
         "General and administrative expenses were $14.1 million, compared to $14.4 million for the same period last year. The decrease in our G&A expenses was attributed primarily to lower professional services and patent related fees. I reiterate that our strong balance sheet will provide support and flexibility for our pipeline progress into 2023, as well as our commitment to fiscal discipline with allocations of our capital.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Cindy."

         "Good afternoon and welcome to Editas Medicine Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. All participants are now in a listen-only mode. There will be a question-and-answer session at the end of this call. Please be advised, that this call is being recorded at the company\u2019s request.",
         "I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Mullikin, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations at Editas Medicine."

            "Hello. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Peter for Gena. I guess I had a question or two on EDIT-301. My first one is, I think you showed potentially a best-in-class HbF levels in preclinical studies, maybe you had about 50% HbF levels versus maybe a 30% to 40% by CRISPR, for example, and my question is, I guess, to what extent do you know about having those additional beyond so called 30% threshold that translate to additional clinical benefit? And I have one more question after that. Thanks."

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Thanks, this is Charlie. So the clinical data with fetal hemoglobin induction across retrospectively shows that more fetal hemoglobin is better. And I think you\u2019ll see as the trials progress that while some of the markers are normalized or close to normal from the 30% hemoglobin inductions, you\u2019ll see that others are not, and so markers of red cell hemolysis, for instance, are unlikely to be normalized although we haven\u2019t seen all that data, and normalization of those markers or their increased elevation will have an effect on the symptoms, and the progression of the disease in sickle cell disease."

And I think you previously mentioned is not a CAR NK, it\u2019s rather it works with antibody therapeutics such as anti-HER2 to anti-EGFR. So any, you know, further characterization of the EDIT mates that will be very helpful. And also in \u2013 with regard to preclinical data later this year, would you be able to be a little more specific on the timing of that preclinical data? Thanks."

We\u2019re reluctant to tell you about which meeting, because it all depend on the abstracts and getting submitted \u2013 accepted and whether we get to talk or a posture, et cetera. So we wouldn\u2019t want to bias any of those things.

We\u2019ve talked quite a bit about our foundational IP position in both Cas9 as well as Cas12a. Right now we\u2019re using Cas12a for our cell-based medicines, and it\u2019s a very good enzyme and it puts us in a great intellectual property position. We\u2019re developing our own methods that we need to avoid the intellectual property that others have so far."

It is stable and safety is a good thing. But you know, as I recall ProQR\u2019s program, the antisense program, they were able to see visual improvement by month, three, five o'clock correctly. You know, how long would you need to wait? Do you think to see an efficacy? And I have a follow-up."

So this is going to be the most difficult place for us to see efficacy in this study. So we\u2019re eagerly awaiting a fulsome look at the datas out there."
