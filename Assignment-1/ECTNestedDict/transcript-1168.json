      "David Wilson": [
         "Thanks, Deb. I\u2019m happy to join you today for my first official earnings call and what I anticipate will be an exciting and rewarding journey together. It\u2019s been a very busy and fast-paced eight weeks for me at Columbus McKinnon, and I\u2019m glad to report that my family and I are now officially residents of Buffalo. We\u2019ve also completed our New York state quarantine restriction period, finally.",
         "I\u2019ve been impressed with the responsiveness and agility of the management team during these unprecedented times. While onboarding in this environment has been somewhat of a challenge, I have been able to visit key Columbus McKinnon enterprise locations and manufacturing sites, as well as meet with a good number of our team members in person.",
         "Technology has enabled me to actively interact with our team where I have not been able to travel and meet in person. I\u2019ve really enjoyed the energy and the passion of our team, their commitment to driving results and the opportunity to begin building relationships with our customers and shareholders.",
         "I see a great deal of potential here. I believe we can strengthen our business operating system and continue to drive sustainable operating improvement. I also see the potential to deliver both organic and strategic growth by advancing our processes supporting marketing, product management, new product development and corporate development.",
         "Our first quarter results validated the improvements in the company\u2019s business model and have been implemented over the past few years and also demonstrated the effectiveness of the quick actions taken to protect earnings, generate cash and adapt to a rapidly evolving environment.",
         "We achieved our goal of positive operating income and cash generation, even as revenue was down 35% year-over-year. In fact, our gross margin of 32.2% this quarter, which we believe is the trough, compares favorably with the peak gross margins the business had achieved prior to the 2008 recession.",
         "As noted, we were positive at the operating income level with GAAP operating income of $1.8 million and adjusted operating income of $5 million. While Columbus McKinnon has successfully generated cash through all cycles, E-PAS, our business operating system has further improved that capability. We generated $9.5 million in cash from operations in the quarter. And given prioritized capital expenditures, we had free cash flow of $8.4 million.",
         "Today, Columbus McKinnon has a healthy balance sheet and a fair amount of dry powder. Our net debt leverage ratio was just 1.2 times and we have liquidity of over $210 million. This positions us well to be on the offensive as our markets recover and as we advance Phase III of our Blueprint for Growth strategy.",
         "If you will turn to Slide 4, I\u2019ll update you on the progress we have made by leveraging our business operating system to improve our performance. Our E-PAS cadence provided the visibility and rigor needed to define and implement the actions required to address the dramatic decline in demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This enabled us to achieve our positive operating income and cash-generation goals.",
         "In addition, we capitalized on the situation and accelerated operational excellence plans to structurally reduce indirect overhead costs and improve the earnings power of the organization.",
         "For fiscal 2021, we expect to reduce annualized costs by approximately $11 million. About $6 million of this is related to the 80/20 Process and facility consolidations. We are now down to a total of 15 manufacturing facilities from 22 just three years ago. Our actions have also created structural changes resulting in approximately $5 million in our SG&A and factory indirect overhead cost savings.",
         "While we believe the trough is behind us, we continue to proactively manage our costs. As demand improved throughout the quarter, we recalled about 130 furloughed associates. However, there were about 238 of our team members still furloughed at the end of June.",
         "Let me now turn it over to Greg to provide more detail on our financial results.",
         "Thanks, Greg. Orders dropped 31% in the first quarter year-over-year and 30% sequentially, but encouragingly improved through the quarter into July. In fact, orders were up 25% in July through last Friday, driven by our projects business. Our monthly short cycle orders were up in the mid-teens.",
         "Our expectation for the second quarter this year is for revenue to be in the range of about $150 million to $160 million. At the midpoint of our guidance, revenue would be up about 12% from the trailing first quarter and down about 25% from last year\u2019s second quarter.",
         "We remain focused on generating positive operating income and cash flow in this depressed environment. Importantly, we\u2019re prepared to respond to market conditions, both positively and negatively. I would say at this time, though, while there is improvement sequentially in our end markets, customers remain cautious.",
         "Let me touch on the status of a few markets. The utility market is improving as projects came back to life. The hurricane season in the Southeast and Gulf Coast region should also help demand. The North American automotive market has improved, but is still running at less than full capacity.",
         "We see opportunities in this market with our ProPath system, as manufacturers look at ways to provide additional lifting capacity for moving components within workstations in order to provide sufficient distance between employees. In fact, our ProPath could be a great solution in a large variety of workstation environments across multiple industries.",
         "Entertainment remains heavily impacted by the pandemic and the elimination of venues that attract crowds and efforts to stem its spread. While we have seen some fixed venue installation projects advancing, traveling, concerts and trade shows have been postponed. To keep things in context, this market vertical represents about 3% of our business during normal conditions.",
         "Commercial construction is expected to pick up this quarter, and we\u2019re encouraged with our oil and gas activity. Projects in the Middle East and Asia are continuing to move forward.",
         "As you know, orders in the rail business tend to be lumpy. But despite COVID-19 conditions, orders were up nearly $2 million in the quarter, an 86% increase over fiscal 2020\u2019s first quarter orders. Quote activity remained solid as well. Although given travel restrictions, sales have been impacted due to border closings, preventing deliveries and installations.",
         "In sum, we are seeing improvements in several of the markets we serve. As noted earlier, our balance sheet is strong. We are focusing our capital on growth and maintaining our dividend at current levels.",
         "I\u2019m excited about the refinements and advancements we are developing for the Blueprint for Growth strategy. The strategy has established a foundation that we must continue to fortify with the effective applications of the tools of our business operating system, E-PAS. This includes 80/20, strategy development and lean manufacturing processes, among others. We also need to encourage and develop talent within our organization to drive innovation.",
         "Beyond these reinforcements that will improve our competitive position, we need to advance our growth in Phase III and understand the market opportunities we can capture where our strengths and capabilities provide our customers with clear advantages.",
         "We are focused on becoming a more market-led, customer-centric and operationally excellent business with a purpose-driven culture. I believe this will uncover potential we have not yet realized. We are progressing on all of these fronts, and I look forward to updating you with greater specificity in the future.",
         "Operator, we can now open the line for questions."
      ],
      "Deborah Pawlowski": [
         "Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate your time today and your interest in Columbus McKinnon. Here with me are David Wilson, our President and CEO; and Greg Rustowicz, our Chief Financial Officer.",
         "You should have a copy of the first quarter fiscal 2021 financial results, which we released this morning before the market. If not, you can access the release as well as the slides that will accompany our conversation today at our website, www.columbusmckinnon.com. After our formal presentation, we will be opening the line for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]",
         "If you\u2019ll turn to Slide 2 in the deck, I will first review the safe harbor statement. You should be aware that we may make some forward-looking statements during the formal discussions as well as during the Q&A session. These statements apply to future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties as well as other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is stated here today. These risks and uncertainties and other factors are provided in the earnings release as well as with other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents can be found on our website or at sec.gov.",
         "During today\u2019s call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these will be useful in evaluating our performance. You should not consider the presentation of additional information in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have provided reconciliation of non-GAAP measures with comparable GAAP measures in the tables that accompany today\u2019s release and the slides for your information.",
         "So with that, if you will turn to Slide 3, I will turn it over to David to begin. David?"
      ],
      "Gregory Rustowicz": [
         "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. On Slide 5, net sales in the fourth quarter were $139.1 million. Demand was severely impacted by COVID-19. This was not a surprise to us as we expected first quarter fiscal 2021 revenue of approximately $130 million to $140 million, we finished at the top-end of our previous guidance for revenue. Order rates improved monthly throughout the quarter, as the U.S. and many countries globally began to open up again.",
         "Looking at our sales bridge, volume declined by $74 million, or 34.8%. While volume was down, we did realize positive pricing as we saw year-over-year pricing improved by 1.1%. All this price improvement was implemented prior to April 1. Foreign currency was a modest headwind and reduced our sales by $2 million.",
         "Let me provide a little color on sales by region. For the first quarter, we saw sales volume decline in the U.S. by 37.2%. This was partially offset by price increases of 1.2%. Outside of the U.S., sales volume was down 32%, which was partially offset by price increases of 1.1%. Sales volume was down 43% in Canada, 39% in Latin America, 32% in APAC and down just 30% in EMEA.",
         "Turning to orders and backlog, both our short cycle and project-based businesses saw different order pattern declines. Adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, overall, orders were down year-over-year by 29.6%. Our short cycle business was down year-over-year and sequentially, almost 40%, and our project business was down 20%.",
         "Our short cycle business primarily sells through distribution and saw an immediate decline in orders when states and countries began shutting down, whereas our project business continued to a large degree as many projects that have been previously quoted were turned into orders. Order rates did improve sequentially high single-digit percentages in May and June from the April trough. This trend has accelerated in July.",
         "Going into our fiscal second quarter, backlog was essentially unchanged at about $131 million. While there is much uncertainty globally on the effects of COVID-19 and the shape of the recovery, we believe that we will see sequential improvement in orders and sales going forward. Yet, we are being very cautious as we continually monitor the channel and follow macroeconomic indicators.",
         "We believe inventory in the channel is balanced for the current demand levels. All of our factories are operating today, and we are flexing production back up as demand improves. Our strong market position in leading brands continue to serve us well, especially in times like these. We continue to focus on customer responsiveness and on-time delivery, and we believe in this environment, this will be more important than ever.",
         "On Slide 6, our gross margin was 32.2% in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, eliminating the effects of factory closure costs and business realignment costs, we achieved an adjusted gross margin for the quarter of 33.8%. To put this into perspective, as David previously mentioned, our peak gross margin prior to the Great Recession in 2008 was 32.1%.",
         "We have clearly improved our mix of businesses and have benefited from our 80/20 Process and operational excellence initiatives. The 80/20 Process contributed $1.9 million of gross profit expansion in the quarter through strategic pricing, indirect overhead reductions and factory closures.",
         "Let\u2019s now review the quarter\u2019s gross profit bridge. First quarter gross profit of $44.8 million was down $30.8 million compared to the prior year. This was driven by a $27 million impact from lower sales volumes. We did see gross profit expansion from pricing, as previously mentioned, and we experienced no material cost inflation in the quarter.",
         "Tariffs were lower than the prior year as we imported less Chinese product. We incurred $1.4 million of incremental one-time costs for factory closures. Besides the footprint consolidation in Ohio, which finished up in July, we also completed a footprint consolidation at our 22,000 square foot facility in France.",
         "Foreign currency translation reduced gross profit by $600,000. Productivity, net of other cost changes, was negative $4.3 million. While we took significant action to flex our workforce to meet demand, we weren\u2019t able to fully absorb all of our factory fixed costs in the quarter.",
         "As shown on Slide 7, RSG&A was $39.9 million in the quarter, or 28.7% of sales. RSG&A was approximately $5.2 million lower than the previous year. The reduction in RSG&A was due to several factors. We lowered our RSG&A cost by $6.7 million, which included lower headcount, limited travel costs and no bonus accruals.",
         "This was partially offset by $1 million of additional costs related to David joining the company, as well as $1.1 million in higher bad debt accruals related to a handful of specific accounts. We also benefited from FX translation of approximately $600,000.",
         "With the current COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken quick and decisive action to reduce our RSG&A costs as evidenced this quarter. We will continue to monitor demand levels and will responsibly add back some of these costs when the time is right. Taking all of this into account, including the structural cost changes implemented in fiscal Q1, we are forecasting Q2 FY 2021 RSG&A of approximately $38.5 million.",
         "Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted operating income was $5 million. Adjusted operating margin was 3.6% of sales, a 960 basis point decline from the prior year. The driver of this decline was the impact that COVID-19 had on our sales volume. Decremental adjusted operating leverage in the quarter was a negative 31%, which is significantly better than what we saw during the Great Recession when we experienced decremental operating leverage of 38%.",
         "Our Blueprint for Growth strategy, and specifically our 80/20 Process and operational excellence initiatives, have improved our business model and better enable us to perform in a significant recession.",
         "As you can see on Slide 9, we recorded a GAAP loss per diluted share for the quarter of $0.12. This includes about $0.09 per share impact related to pension settlement expense as we are in the process of terminating one of our U.S. pension plans. GAAP EPS was also impacted by factory closure costs and business realignment costs of $3.1 million, or $0.10 per share. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.07, compared with $0.81 in the previous year, a decrease of $0.74 per share.",
         "I should also note that during this current quarter, we expect an additional non-cash charge of $15 million to $18 million for the final settlement to terminate this pension plan. I would like to note that this plan will be in a surplus position of $2 million to $3 million after all termination expenses are paid. This is part of our strategy to derisk our defined benefit pension plans. We expect fiscal 2021\u2019s full-year tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22%.",
         "On Slide 10, our adjusted EBITDA margin on a trailing 12-month basis declined to 14.1% as a result of COVID-19. Our return on invested capital also declined to 8.9%. We are continuing to target 19% EBITDA margins and ROIC in the mid-teens, but the timing for the achievement of this objective will be impacted by the shape of the recovery curve from COVID-19.",
         "Moving to Slide 11, you have heard me say many times that one of the hallmarks of Columbus McKinnon is its ability to generate cash throughout the business cycle. Net cash from operating activities for the quarter was $9.5 million, which was a year-over-year increase of $11.7 million. We took rapid actions to preserve and generate cash.",
         "Our working capital as a percent of sales was 14.9%, which contributed to our free cash flow improvement. Going forward, we believe we still have opportunities to reduce our inventory levels further. We are maintaining our CapEx guidance at $5 million for the first-half of the year and will reassess our CapEx spend for the second-half of the year based on economic conditions.",
         "Turning to Slide 12. Our total debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $276 million, and our net debt was approximately $124 million. Our net debt to net total capitalization is now approximately 21%. We repaid the minimum required principal payments in Q1 of $1.1 million and plan to pay the same amount quarterly for the remainder of fiscal 2021.",
         "We have made excellent progress delevering and have achieved the net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.2 times, which provides us sufficient financial flexibility to weather the current pandemic.",
         "We have a flexible capital structure, which is covenant-light, which means our financial covenant is only tested if we have outstanding borrowings against our revolver. While we did draw $25 million on our revolver for liquidity and working capital purposes in the quarter, we expect to repay this borrowing in early October.",
         "Finally, liquidity remains strong at over $210 million.",
         "Please turn to Slide 13, and I will turn it back over to David."

         "Remarks": [
            "Chris, we don\u2019t generally comment on gross margin performance. But I would say that as volumes increase, we would anticipate that we would start to leverage slightly better. I\u2019ll ask Greg if he has specific comments he\u2019d like to add, but that\u2019s my general response?"

         "Speaker": "David Wilson"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. And there are certain adjustments that only get made on the quarter. So it\u2019s a little more tricky to look at the improvement in gross margin on a month-by-month basis. But going forward, we will benefit from the plant consolidations, footprint consolidations that we had.",
            "But on the contrary, we are expecting to take our inventory levels down further, which would mean that there will be less production than what you would normally expect. So net-net, we would expect, I guess, going forward to see some marginal, slight improvement in gross margins."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Gregory Rustowicz"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Great. And my one follow-up question. You touched on it a little bit. The $11 million in savings potential for this fiscal year 2021, can you comment on perhaps some additional upside or the backlog of savings opportunities as Phase II continues, perhaps some opportunities further out in fiscal year 2022 that are maybe in the earlier innings or could be more realized as the demand environment normalizes?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Chris Howe"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, Chris. Let me start and then I\u2019ll ask Greg to comment further. We really believe that we\u2019re in the mid innings, if you will, of Phase II of our Blueprint for Growth. And there\u2019s further opportunities as we look at improvements we can realize through 80/20. And our plant rationalization, product line rationalization initiatives, as well as work we need to do on our operating cost structure, indirect overhead rates and so forth.",
            "So I believe there\u2019s room for us to continue to advance in terms of improvement there over both, the remainder of this year and into next year. And I\u2019m encouraged by early views that I\u2019ve been able to see. And what I\u2019ll do now is ask Greg if he has further comments that you\u2019d like to make?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "David Wilson"
      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So, Chris, specific to Slide 4, so the $6-plus million represents the $5 million of factory consolidations, which we expect this year and some of it was realized in Q1, specifically related to our Chinese footprint consolidation. So the benefit of 80/20 and that $6-plus million is slightly over $1 million. It\u2019s very difficult to forecast what that\u2019s going to be for the next three quarters, because it is volume dependent in a lot of cases.",
            "So to the extent, volumes come back, the plus in that number will obviously come into play. The $5 million is what we would expect to see on a run rate basis. If you divide that by four, that\u2019s what we will expect to see on a run rate basis over the next three quarters."

      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And Chris, I would just add \u2013 this is David again. I would just add that the targets we established for our EBITDA performance over time remain at the levels we communicated previously during the Investor Day last year. So we\u2019re targeting 19% EBITDA margins or better. And although the timing is impacted given COVID-19, we still believe that our Blueprint for Growth and the execution of our business operating system elements will enable us to achieve that outcome."

            "So I want to start off asking about some of the M&A that you briefly touched on during the comments. I know you had \u2013 you come to form is with a good view on M&A and a lot of deals under your belt in the past. And I think about two months that you\u2019ve been there, can you give us any sense as to, I guess, A, are there a lot of targets out there that are available even during the pandemic? And B, based on what you know, do you think the valuation is somewhat reasonable right now and maybe given your relatively low leverage to get a deal done in the kind of near-term here?"

      "19": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, sure, Mike. Thank you. I \u2013 what I would say is that, we are continuing to evaluate companies that move through our funnel. We have a good process to source and stream deals and we have a corporate development function that\u2019s actively evaluating and paying attention to how the markets are developing. We know deal volume and value is down in the calendar second quarter \u2013 our first \u2013 fiscal first calendar \u2013 first quarter.",
            "We are being disciplined in the way that we evaluate and look at those opportunities and we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined as we evaluate options going forward. We\u2019re also making sure that we\u2019re really focused on areas that are most attractive to us as it relates to our strategy. And we\u2019re going through a process right now as a leadership team of refining our strategy and making sure that we further clarify the specific areas that we\u2019re going to target, both organically and through strategic actions like M&A.",
            "And so I believe that there will be very attractive opportunities for us, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the funnel, and we\u2019ll talk to you more about specifics as we\u2019re prepared to do that. But we\u2019re encouraged that we have a healthy balance sheet, and we\u2019re also encouraged that we\u2019re positioned well in an environment where valuations might be even more attractive."

Is there something to think about from a cost perspective going forward? Or are the costs and contributions that you make be somewhat equal to the previous accruals or even the cash costs of the old pension plan, or maybe everything a little less volatile over time?"

So in this particular plan, and it\u2019s one of 3 U.S. pension plans, we\u2019re in an overfunded position. So we haven\u2019t been funding it from a cash perspective for the last couple of years. And with our LDI strategy, most of the assets prior to the termination have been moved into cash given its overfunded position.",

But clearly, it takes risk off the table and will leave us with two U.S. pension plans, and we also have about three German pension plans at our unfunded plans, the largest being the one that came from Stahl. And this should result in some cash coming back to the company that it will be able to utilize for other purposes when we do terminate it."

And whether this sort of, I don\u2019t know, I think you said 16% increase in orders since June.

And so, I think we\u2019re in a position where we\u2019re seeing real demand, and we think that the stocking levels are relatively balanced.",

And we called back 130 of those. And then we also had some severance activity in the period as well. And the slide that we had in the deck that spoke to our cost actions, it\u2019s Slide #4, highlights our full-year annualized savings estimates at $11 million.",
            "And what you can see highlighted on that slide is that at the end of the quarter, of that 410 that were furloughed, we recalled 130 and then we had some severances. And we had a remainder of 238 people on furlough at the end of the period. And so we\u2019re adjusting that level based on volumes. And as volumes come back and we need to ramp up, we\u2019ll be adjusting those levels.",
            "But we\u2019re also being very mindful of accelerating opportunities for our operational excellence initiatives in our manufacturing areas, particularly as it relates to indirect overhead. And the opportunity to be more efficient with the resources we have in place and those we bring back.",
            "So I think that speaks to some areas where we have costs that may come back. We\u2019ve also been very, very diligent about travel and other spending. And so we\u2019ve been focused on all discretionary spend, and we reduced most of that to really responsible levels.",
            "And what I would say is, as we see things develop and markets starting to return to a higher level of performance, we\u2019d look to invest more money in areas where we can get good returns. And so I think you\u2019ll start to see some of that come back. And I\u2019ll ask Greg to comment further."

That included things like headcount reductions, bonus accruals for the management team, T&E, professional services, 401(k) matches and a cadre of other cost reduction initiatives to protect earnings and generate free cash flow.",
            "So we \u2013 at the time, we said most of that will get added back down the road. But I think the new update is that hubs those cost reductions that we had highlighted back in the May timeframe that we\u2019ve structurally taken out $5 million of cost that will not get added back, and that\u2019s what David was highlighting on Slide 4."

            "Yes. I mean, so my priorities have really been focused around the safety of our people and getting to know the business, really working with our team to climb the learning curve. And then as you can imagine, prioritizing the right actions relative to cost, as well as to cash and key priorities that we\u2019re focused on advancing, because as much of what we\u2019re trying to do now is focus on what we\u2019re not going to do is versus what we are going to do. And then execution period, really focusing on making sure that we execute solidly. And then as you\u2019d imagine, really beginning to turn towards what\u2019s next.",
            "So our strategic plan and focusing on what the specific elements of our strategic plan will be as we finalize that work in the second quarter \u2013 our fiscal second quarter. So I\u2019m putting a lot of emphasis on that. And obviously, along the way, working on building relationships, building relationships with our employees, with our customers, with our shareholders and with our Board.",
            "And so I\u2019m happy to say that, I\u2019ve been able to make progress on all fronts. I\u2019m pleased with the work that we\u2019re doing and feel like we\u2019re making good progress with what I put together as a 100-day plan as we\u2019re about halfway through that now.",
            "So, in terms of surprises, I\u2019d just say that I\u2019m pleased with the leadership team. I\u2019m pleased with the capabilities we have in the organization and the opportunities that we have as an enterprise. And I think that we have a lot that we can work on, both internally, that\u2019s within our control from a self-help and a performance improvement standpoint, as well as opportunities that we can pursue within the marketplace.",
            "So I\u2019m pretty excited about that and we\u2019re very focused on the next round of strategic work as we had prepared to advance that phase III activity in our Blueprint for Growth strategy.",
            "In terms of negative surprises, nothing that I would speak to that\u2019s of note. I mean, I\u2019m just disappointed that given constraints around COVID-19, I haven\u2019t been able to travel to every location and get out to see everything in the portfolio just yet. But technology has been very supportive and our team has been very highly engaged. So it\u2019s been a really \u2013 as I said in my opening comments, a busy eight weeks and I\u2019m looking forward to the next eight."
