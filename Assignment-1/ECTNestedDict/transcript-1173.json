         "Good morning and sincerely welcome to this presentation of SCA's half year report for 2020. The report will be presented by CEO, Ulf Larsson; and CFO, Toby Lawton. And after the introduction, there will be an opportunity to ask questions on the report.",
         "So, please, Ulf take over."
      ],
      "Toby Lawton": [
         "Thank you, Ulf, and good morning, everybody. I'll turn first to the income statement. And here, you can see for the quarter, we had, as Ulf mentioned, an EBIDTA of just over SEK1 billion for the quarter, which gave an EBITDA margin of 21.3% this quarter, and then an EBIT of SEK600 million in the quarter. We had financial items of SEK31 million, a bit lower than we had last year. And as Ulf mentioned, the net debt is slightly lower than it was at the same time last year. I'll come back to that. We also have some effect here that we are capitalizing interest on the part that's financing the new investment project in Obbola, that had some impact as well in reducing the net financial cost. The tax is SEK110 million, with an effective tax rate of 20%, which leads to a net profit in the quarter of SEK459 million and an earnings per share of SEK0.65 per share.",
         "Let's turn to the next page with the contribution by segment and quarter. And I start on the left-hand side for the Forest. And on the top left, you see the net sales development for the Forest. And here you can see versus the previous quarter, we have a lower net sales, and this is really due to the lower delivery volumes from forest this quarter, partly related to the volume issues Ulf mentioned in the industries. I'll come back to that.",
         "On the EBITDA side, we had higher EBITDA this quarter, which is really due to the the higher share of harvesting from our own forest compared to the first quarter, which is a seasonal effect that we see every year. And then over a bit longer perspective here, you can also see that we have a higher revaluation effect that we've implemented from this year of coming from the new method for valuing forest assets, and that's offsetting the effect of lower wood prices, which have come down successively since last year.",
         "In the Wood segment, you can see an increase in sales, which is a result of higher delivery volumes and particularly a seasonal effect. We have seasonally higher volumes this quarter, but in the supply operation, we also had strong volume. So it's better-than-expected on the sales side. And then also on the bottom line side, we had the positive effect of those volumes. We have slightly higher selling prices and lower raw materials costs as well. So the EBITDA increased from the first quarter from SEK95 million to SEK143 million this quarter.",
         "When it comes to Pulp, the sales were down on Q1, which is due to the lower delivery levels versus Q1, even though production was on the same level as Q1. We had lower deliveries in the second quarter, which led to a lower top line. And the bottom line is slightly down, more or less flat with the first quarter. And here, we have the effect of the lower delivery volumes. We do have a positive effect from slightly higher prices this quarter. We also now have a lower -- a negative effect from lower electricity prices. So the net electricity that we're selling from \u00d6strand is impacted. We have low electricity prices in our region at the moment.",
         "When it comes to the paper division, you can see on the top line, there's a 16% decline quarter-on-quarter on sales, which is really driven by the lower publication paper volumes this quarter. And on the bottom line, that also has a significant impact on the EBITDA with the low capacity utilization that we have in publication paper as a result of the low volumes.",
         "In addition, we had a maintenance stop in Obbola, which had an impact of SEK68 million. So those two effects together result in the declined EBITDA versus the first quarter for the Paper segment.",
         "If I turn to the next page on the bridge of net sales. Here, you can see versus the second quarter last year, the impact of price/mix was negative 9% versus the second quarter of last year and more or less it impacts all segments. The volume impact is primarily from publication paper, but there's a 4% negative impact on net sales. Then we have a positive currency versus the second quarter last year of 3% as well. So overall, a 10% impact on net sales.",
         "When it comes to EBITDA, you can see here the impact of the prices, the lower prices impacts EBITDA was SEK550 million. And then we have an impact of the lower volumes on publication paper of SEK67 million. It's mainly publication paper, and this is really the impact of the lower capacity utilization and lower volumes we have in publication paper. And we have a positive impact from raw materials with lower cost, particularly for wood raw materials. We have a worse energy balance this quarter versus last year, which is, again, as I mentioned, the -- impacted by -- the impact of the net -- lower net income from energy sales in \u00d6strand. We have a positive currency of SEK67 million and then a small positive impact also SEK23 million in terms of other and fixed costs.",
         "If I then turn to the cash flow, and here, you can see in the quarter, we had an EBITDA of SEK1.001 billion in this quarter. And then when we take away the effect of the revaluation of biological assets and other noncash items, we had an operating cash surplus of SEK768 million in the quarter. We had a working capital outflow of SEK151 million. We have a cash outflow seasonally in the first half year.",
         "We usually see a cash outflow in the first half year. This year, it's helped a bit by the lower volumes and prices. So net, we have an increase of SEK151 million in net working capital. I can also mention here that, to date, we have not seen any impact here from the corona pandemic in terms of working capital positions.",
         "Current capital expenditure is SEK338 million, in line with last year, which leads to a total operating cash flow for the quarter of SEK273 million. We then had strategic capital expenditures this quarter of SEK655 million, which is mainly Obbola. We had a significant down payment this quarter on the paper machine. So we had a large strategic capital expenditure outlay this quarter also.",
         "And the next slide, I can share the development of our net debt. And as Ulf mentioned, our net debt is lower than it was at the same time last year. We are SEK300 million lower than we were at the same time last year. And at the same time, we have financed strategic investments during 2019 and the first half of 2020 of more than SEK2 billion. And now, of course, that's mainly the \u00d6strand project that we are financing in terms of strategic investments.",
         "And then in addition, we also have -- just to remind you, an unutilized credit facilities of SEK7.7 billion as at the 30th of June this year. And finally, turn to the balance sheet. And firstly, here, you can see on the top line, you can see the Forest assets. And here, we have had an increase versus the end of last year of about SEK1.2 billion from SEK69.7 billion up to SEK70.9 billion. And if I bring your attention to the last line here, where you see the line market price for forest assets.",
         "Here, you can see the market price in our region as we measure it over a 3-year average. And you can see that it's now SEK5 per cubic meter higher than it was at the end of last year. And that shows that the attractiveness of the forest asset category is relatively unaffected by the current situation. And if you apply this price increase to the expected volume that we're going to have at the end of this year, then it would lead to an increase in the forest assets of SEK2.4 billion. And we apply this proportionately throughout the year. So so far, with half year gone, we have SEK1.2 billion reflected in the forest assets that we have in the balance sheet.",
         "Then the next line down is the working capital. And here, you can see it's increased versus the last year. Again, at the half year point, we seasonally have an increase in working capital. So we are some SEK200 million higher on this point than the end of last year. We have deferred tax, and then we have other capital employed, which is some SEK700 million higher than it was at the end of the last year, which is mainly the investment in Obbola and the fixed assets associated with the buildup of the new mill in Obbola.",
         "So we have a total capital employed now of some SEK79 billion. Of that, some SEK9.4 billion is financed from net debt. So we have SEK9.4 billion of net debt, and we have a debt-to-EBITDA multiple of 2.1x. This is higher than it was in the last quarter, and this is mainly due to the run rate of EBITDA over 12 months, which has come down rather than an increase in net debt. And then we have, SEK69 billion is financed from equity. So net equity of SEK69.4 billion, and we have a debt-to-equity ratio of 14%.",
         "So by that, I will hand back to Ulf for a summary."
      ],
      "Ulf Larsson": [
         "Thank you for that, Bj\u00f6rn. Also from my side, good morning, and a warm welcome to the presentation of the SCA results for the second quarter 2020. And I'd like to start with this slide, a summary of the second quarter. And I can state that also during the second quarter, we have been clearly impacted by the corona pandemic. The main priority has been to secure the health of our employees. And by doing so, we have also succeeded in securing a stable operation in a quite challenging time.",
         "The sales was generally well maintained during the second quarter 2020 compared to the first quarter '19, owing to a stable development of volume for all product areas, except from publication paper, and I will come back to that later. The prices within all product areas have, however, been substantially lower during the first part of 2020 compared to the same period 2019. And the sharp decline in prices has, of course, had a negative impact on the sales but above all on EBITDA, which dropped 25% versus the same quarter last year.",
         "When looking to the demand for each product area, we have been differently affected by the corona pandemic. Apparent demand in the full value chain is hard to predict, and we clearly saw effects from hoarding an inventory built up immediately after the outbreak of the corona pandemic, not the least in pulp and kraftliner. And now we feel in these areas that we are in a destocking phase. The demand for solid wood product has been surprisingly good to strong during the whole period while we see more or less a collapse in the demand for publication paper.",
         "During the quarter, we have also seen continued lower cost for raw materials, such as wood, chemicals and so on. Based on the survey made of our forest holdings during the summer of 2019, we have now confirmed the increase in harvesting volume in our own forest from today's level of 4.3 million cubic meter to 5.4 million cubic meter. And this increase will be gradually implemented up to the year 2025, resulting in a successive increase in long-term cash flow of SEK300 million to SEK400 million per year.",
         "When looking at our financial numbers for Q2 2020, we can establish that we delivered a little bit more than SEK1 billion at EBITDA level. This is more or less at the same level as we had in the first quarter 2020. But when we compare with the second quarter '19, it is a reduction of 25%. We have an EBITDA margin of 21%, which is equal to the margin level for the first quarter 2020. And by that, we also had an industrial return on capital employed of 6%, calculated over the last 12 months. And as you can see here, the SCA model maintains the margin level even in tough time due to the stable contribution from our forest holdings. Our leverage increased to 2.1 due to current lower EBITDA level but the absolute debt level is still lower than last year despite the big investment in Obbola, which is running according to the plan.",
         "So I now like to make some comments for each segment, and I'll start with Forest. And we have also, during the second quarter, had a stable supply of wood to our industries. We have seen a continued steady drop in pulpwood prices, both for the pulpwood we purchased through import as well for the wood we buy on stumpage from private forest owners in the region. And today, we have, in the SCA area, no real impact from spruce beetle damages on either price or quality. Sales, was down by 14% due to lower volumes and prices versus last year. EBITDA increased by 21% despite the lower prices and volumes, and that is mainly due to the increase in net growth in the forest from 3 million to 4 million cubic meter annually and the increased earnings from revaluation of biological assets.",
         "In Wood, we have had, as I said, a surprisingly strong consumption during the second quarter 2020. And that goes mainly for Scandinavia, but also in U.K., U.S. and Central Europe. We have seen especially high demand from the building materials sector, but also from the DIY business. Asia has been a bit slower for us during the second quarter. We have seen rather big volumes coming in from Russia to China. And in Japan, we have seen lower building activities during this period. We had expected a somewhat bigger impact from the corona pandemic in this area, so we have reduced production levels somewhat during the quarter and also over the summer. Otherwise, we could have delivered high volumes.",
         "My expectation last quarter was that we should see a small price increase for solid wood products between the first quarter and to the second quarter this year, and the actual outcome was, for us, was about 2% and a bit higher than in local currency. And I believe that we will see another small price increase for Wood in the third and maybe also for the fourth quarter.",
         "Versus last year, sales was rather flat, but EBITDA was down 24% due to lower prices. As said -- as I said earlier, apparent demand for pulp in the full value chain is hard to predict. And we clearly saw hoarding an inventory built up immediately after the outbreak of the corona pandemic. And now we feel that we are in a destocking phase. Still, inventory levels are on the normal level for both softwood and hardwood pulp.",
         "European NBSK PIX price went from $840 per ton up to $860 in Q2, but now it's come back to $840 again in July. Pulp sales decreased by 10% in the second quarter 2020 compared to the second quarter '19, and that is entirely due to lower prices. And as you can see from the diagram below to the left, prices have fallen sharply during the corresponding period, and this has resulted in an EBITDA drop of 47%.",
         "During July, affecting the third quarter, a leakage in the recovery boiler was detected and the pulp mill was emergency stopped. The inspection after days of cooling down the boiler show that a black leaker injector had been slightly wrongly positioned and had damaged the water tube in the boiler. After repair and during the restart of the pulp mill, further consequences of the emergency stop were detected, and the screen basket in the boiler had been damaged and had to be replaced, causing several days of additional stoppage. So we estimate today that we will lose around 50,000 tons during the third quarter, and that will give a financial effect around SEK150 million in the third quarter.",
         "So if we then turn over to Paper, exactly as it is in Pulp, it is also in kraftliner, hard to predict the current demand as we also here saw an inventory built up during the first quarter. And now we feel that we are in a destocking phase. Demand for boxes has come down a bit, but kraftliner inventories are still on a normal level. The price for unbleached kraftliner increased by EUR 30 per ton in the second quarter, but that will be reduced again by EUR 30 per ton during the third quarter.",
         "If we then turn over to Publication paper, we can see that demand has fallen dramatically, 30% to 40%, depending on grade during the quarter due to the corona pandemic and immediate cuts in marketing budgets and print advertising. And we have then had to make market-related downtime due to the lower demand and had a low capacity utilization as a result. This is the main reason for paper sales down 21%, and EBITDA was also down 53% versus last year. When it comes to price for publication paper, they have been stable in the second quarter, but the weaker market situation described will led to price reductions in the third quarter of some EUR 20 to EUR 30 per ton from an already low level.",
         "I'm pleased to say that we have managed to complete the planned maintenance stop in Obbola during the second quarter, and we made careful plans and managed to carry out all activities as expected, allowing us to keep the project on track, the big expansion project in Obbola.",
         "So as mentioned last quarter, we conducted a forest survey of our Swedish forests back in 2019. And among other things, we could state that the annual growth was 1 million cubic meter higher than we earlier measured. We also could note that the standing volume was 11 million cubic meter higher than earlier estimated. Based on this information, we can now confirm the annual harvesting volume in our own forest will increase from today's level of 4.3 million cubic meter per year to 5.4 million cubic meter per year. And this increase will be gradually implemented up to year 2025, resulting in a successive increase in long-term cash flow of SEK300 million to SEK400 million from 2025.",
         "So as I mentioned at the start, the business during Q2 has been clearly impacted by the corona pandemic. And with us, our main priority has been to secure our employees' health. And by doing so, we have succeeded in securing a stable operation. So the impact on production, deliveries and demand for SCA products related to the corona pandemic has, in other words, so far, been limited with one big exception, and that is in publication papers. Here we having one go lost 30% to 40% of the market, and we have also been forced to make substantial curtailments during the period with, of course, a big negative impact on the result for the quarter.",
         "So by that, I hand over to Toby.",
         "Yes. I mean, I think we have told the story, and we can open up for questions already now."

         "Remarks": [
            "I have a 3-part question on the decline we're seeing now in publication paper. You mentioned prices coming down now between EUR 20 or EUR 30 per ton into the second half. Is that locked in for the whole of the second half? Or could there be potential for further price negotiations in the coming months?",
            "The second question is more of a bit of a medium-term view. And I know it's, obviously, very hard to forecast here, but do you think that the demand in publication paper will gradually bounce back as the economy is reopening? Or should we consider the possibility that COVID-19 could actually also accelerate the structural shift that we're seeing from print to digital? If you have any comments on what your customers are telling you, that would be helpful.",
            "And then thirdly, as a consequence of these developments, are you evaluating any further permanent mill closures or potential future conversions into packaging grades? Those were my questions."

      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. If we start with the first one. As I said, we've had a rather flat price development in publication papers for a couple of quarters and on a low level, I would say. And now we see that we will have price reductions for the second half of this year. And I mean for publication papers, I would say, that the absolute majority prices are set for six months, and that means that we will have this price level for the coming six months, more or less. That's my thinking.",
            "The second one was maybe if we have reached some kind of new normal. And yes, I believe so, more or less, I think that we -- I mean, after the financial crisis -- we have a structurally declining market in publication papers. We've had that for many, many years. And the industry has been quite good in closing down capacity. So I mean keeping the balance in a reasonably good way. After the financial crisis, I mean, we saw a sharp drop in consumption, and it never went back to what it was.",
            "And I think that we will face more or less the same thing here going forward now. So I think it might be possible that we have -- we will reach some kind of new normal in publication paper. And I mean publication paper for us is not our core business. And since 2012, we have reduced the capacity from 2 million tons per year down to, today, 700,000 tons per year. And we have also said that we will, sooner or later, reduced exposure to publication paper further. So this is not the place where we should be in the future."

And also, you said you're fairly cautious on sort of bounce back in demand, but I guess the lockdowns in Q2 have been quite harsh on demand. Do you expect Q3 and Q4 demand to be in line with Q2 or better?"

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Robin, Toby here. I can take the first question. I mean, basically, input cost when it comes to the key raw materials, if it's wood or chemicals, are pretty flat now between -- have been pretty flat development over the first half year. So we don't expect a big change in that for the second half of the year, either the main input costs are pretty flat. The biggest impact that, by far, to remember in terms of cost is really the capacity utilization, which has a big impact. I think you see these kind of lower volumes than your capacity utilization goes down and your -- basically, your fixed cost coverage, as a result, is not as good. So that's really what affects the result in publication paper with these lower volumes. It's -- yes, that's the biggest effect.",

And it is in this area, I would say it's hard to judge the consumption for the rest of the year. But I mean, we -- I mean, we don't really forecast that we are in a tough position when it comes to publication paper, and we have a very low capacity utilization in this field. And I feel that goes for the whole market as it is just now."

And then if that includes Ortviken or not, that's not necessarily -- that's not important, really. So I mean we have done substantial investments in pulp. We've done it in kraftliner. We do it just now. And we're also investing in forest, and we have a very solid business in wood. And I mean we will put our money into this field. So it is better really to invest where we know that we will have a good return on the money. So we don't just look at one site."

I do understand there will probably be some destocking among customers late in the quarter but, I guess, early in the quarter, there was still some hoarding. So why such weak volumes in the quarter? Also what should we expect for the rest of the year in terms of delivery volumes and capacity utilization? And then finally, on the cost side, when I look at H1 in pulp, and I look at volume-weighted crops and then compare it back to what you had in 2015, 2016, surely mill is not running at optimal capacity yet, but still it feels like the costs are quite high. So could you give any kind of guidelines about sort of the outlook for either midterm or long-term for both the volumes and the cost expectations you have in pulp?"

So that's the reason why we had to hold back the sales in the second quarter and deliveries. So that is by purpose. And -- but then again, as I mentioned, we had a breakdown now in the beginning of the third quarter, which is absolutely unplanned. And that will have a huge impact. It is 50,000 tones, and it was a rather small thing to start with, but then we had consequences in the -- also in the fiber line. And just now, we are starting up. And now everything seems to work well again. But it will have -- we will lose 50,000 tones in the third quarter. And the negative effect on the result, we have estimated to SEK150 million for the third quarter. So I mean -- but deliveries, production was good in the second quarter, and deliveries were planned due to the fact that we have to take a planned stop in the -- between the third and the fourth quarter, I think.",

            "Yes, absolutely. And I think here, it's important to remember also that the deliveries were lower in the second quarter, as Ulf mentioned, but the production was on a similar level to Q1. So you can't take the delivery volume as a guidance for the cost. But in fact, the cost development in the Q2 versus Q1 was in the right direction and was okay. We still have some way to go, but it was in the right direction. And we have an impact ongoing as well, which I mentioned in my presentation, from electricity prices, which is, versus last year, is negative that we're a net seller of electricity in \u00d6strand and therefore, the electricity price which is now during Q2 and probably Q1 has been very low in the northern part of Sweden, lower than other parts of Sweden. So that has an impact as well. But overall, the cost development's heading in the right direction."

And then, I mean, we had a stop in the recovery boiler, but then you have other consequences also. I mean, one was, as we said, the screen basket, but we had also some -- I don't even know the English words of everything. But I mean, we had several engines that broke down. We had -- as pulp after a while get colder, then you have another density, and it's -- I mean, it creates a lot of problems. I mean we have had a disaster then now for more or less two weeks.
