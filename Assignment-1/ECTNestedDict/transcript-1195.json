      "Charles Brindamour": [
         "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Ken thanks for the introduction. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on society. Healthcare professionals and essential workers have done a tremendous job on the front lines, while governments have moved fast on many fronts.",
         "Despite these efforts, there is still uncertainty as to how long the crisis will persist, so businesses have an important role to play here in supporting their communities as they cope with economic and societal impacts.",
         "We have stepped up to support millions of Canadians through relief, community support and being there in good and bad times, and it\u2019s more important than ever that we work together to get through this.",
         "We entered the crisis in a position of strength, which has enabled us to support our customers. To-date, we have provided more than $350 million of relief to over 1 million policyholders across North America. Our relief continues to be risk-based and needs-based and will evolve as the situation develops.",
         "Speaking of strength, yesterday evening we announced second quarter net operating income of $2.35 per share, an increase of 63% over Q2 2019. The team delivered solid results, despite navigating a difficult environment and accelerating investments in our people and technology, all that while providing relief across all our customer base in North America.",
         "Topline growth was 7% in the quarter with 6% in Canada and a robust 10% in the U.S. IFC growth in the quarter was impacted by 4 points of written premium relief. The overall combined ratio was 89.5% with trend on both sides of the border.",
         "Our view of the ultimate direct cost of COVID-19 has not changed since Q1 as we have seen no evidence to warrant the change to our prudent Q1 bottom up policy-by-policy reserving to ultimate losses. In Canada, the combined ratio of 89% was strong, driven by underlying performance, while U.S. commercial lines delivered a solid 93.2%.",
         "Let\u2019s now look at our results by line of business, starting with Canada. Personal auto growth was solid at 3%, given we provided 7 points of relief in the quarter itself. In the next quarter that is in Q3, we expect the impact from premium relief to be in the low double-digit range.",
         "The combined ratio in the quarter was strong at 84.7%, given the work we have done in the past three years, which meaningfully impacted our mix of business, in addition to reduced driving during the quarter. The benefit from reduced driving was partially offset by a portion of premium relief that was earned during the quarter.",
         "Looking to the coming quarters, the remaining relief will roll through net earned premium, while we expect driving activity to gradually return to normal. From an underwriting standpoint, since the start of COVID, we largely expect relief and driving activity to offset each other over time. Overall, the fundamentals in personal auto are strong.",
         "In personal property, premiums grew a strong 11%, driven by favorable market conditions, the GCNA acquisition and unit growth. The combined ratio at 88.6% was the best Q2 in over a decade, driven by our profitability actions over time and mild weather conditions. Personal property continues to be a solid contributor to our strong underwriting performance overall and I am confident this will continue.",
         "In commercial lines, premium growth of 7% reflects the GCNA acquisition and was tempered by the economic slowdown and our multiple relief measures. The combined ratio of 95.1% reflected strong underlying performance, offset by lower prior year development. The underlying loss ratio improved 5.5 points year-over-year. We are already seeing pricing momentum return and expect us to operate this business close to 90% going forward.",
         "Moving to our U.S. commercial segment. Premiums grew a strong 10%, with robust organic growth across most lines. The underlying loss ratio improved 4.8 points, driven by our ongoing profitability improvement game plan. The combined ratio of 93.2% was strong as this segment continues to trend towards our sustainable low 90s objective.",
         "Let\u2019s turn to the industry outlook. The prevailing hard market conditions we experienced in Canada in 2019 and into early 2020 have been impacted by the crisis. Rate increases in both personal and commercial lines were tempered to help our customers navigate, what is a very difficult economic environment. In the coming months, as activity moves back towards normal, we expect the industry to return to the corrective measures required to restore its ROE to historical levels.",
         "In the near term, the trends that have emerged in the past few months will likely exacerbate the industry\u2019s need for rates, given lower reinvestment yields, economic impact and potential loss exposure likely to arise from the crisis. In the U.S. we see similar trends supporting the hardening market conditions.",
         "And looking at the rest of 2020 for IFC, the crisis is expected to impact topline growth in the mid-single to low double-digit range. Given the strength of our operations entering the crisis, I expect our underwriting performance for the rest of 2020 to be on track.",
         "While managing the crisis and providing relief has been all consuming in the past few months, we haven\u2019t lost a beat on the strategic front. The teams across North America have delivered and accelerated initiatives to ensure that we expand our leadership position.",
         "As you know, our roadmap for the next decade is rooted on expanding our leadership here in Canada, building the best specialty insurer in North America, transforming our competitive advantages and ensuring that our people win in this changing world, and while progress in the near-term is important, the key question for us now is how will the future be permanently altered as a result of COVID-19.",
         "So for consumers, our view is that value for money, ease of access and strong digital engagement will become even more important. Our breadth of products, brands and distribution channels provide optionality for us to emphasize these changing expectations. We have made great leaps on the digital and AI front in the past few years and these have accelerated in the past few months, our intent is to double down on our digital edge.",
         "For businesses, we believe that there will be an increasing differentiation between small and midsized businesses. So we intend to build our leadership with more than one in four small businesses in Canada to simplify and make it easier for them to access our products.",
         "For midsized businesses, we intend to better differentiate our offer and broaden the range of services to those. Our rapid expansion in specialty lines and the acquisition of GCNA and Frank Cowan, give us the perfect platform to win for these businesses across North America.",
         "Finally, this crisis will exacerbate the income and skill disparity that exists in society. And we are stepping up our efforts in the communities where we operate to be an agent of change and a force for good.",
         "We are also ensuring that our people across North America will adapt and gain from this changing world. We are committed to investing in adapting our people skills to our needs of tomorrow and we are also committed to continue to ensure that our environment is one of the most inclusive.",
         "So we intend to integrate these trends and initiatives with our 10-year strategic roadmap in the coming months. Our aim is to position ourselves to excel in a post-COVID environment and come out of this crisis stronger and even more resilient.",
         "So in conclusion, this quarter was a testament to our business\u2019s trend. We ended the quarter with a robust capital margin, ready to absorb severe shocks and invest in strategic opportunities. Our operating ROE has moved into the right zone and our book value is up 8% year-over-year in a turbulent environment. Our business is very resilient and we are well-positioned to continue to beat our financial objectives in the quarters and years ahead.",
         "And with that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte."
      ],
      "Ken Anderson": [
         "Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. A link to our live webcast and published information for this call is posted on our website at intactfc.com under the Investors tab.",
         "As usual, before we start, please refer to slide two for cautionary language regarding the use of forward-looking statements, which form part of this morning\u2019s remarks and slide three for a note on the use of non-IFRS financial measures and important notes on adjustments, terms and definitions used in this presentation.",
         "Once again, our executives join us virtually today from across the country. In Toronto, we have our CEO, Charles Brindamour. With me here in Montreal are Louis Marcotte, CFO; Isabelle Girard, SVP of Personal Lines; and Patrick Barbeau, SVP of Claims. And from Calgary, we are joined by Darren Godfrey, SVP of Commercial Lines. We will begin with prepared remarks, followed by Q&A.",
         "With that, I will turn the call to our CEO, Charles Brindamour.",
         "Thank you, Louis. In order to give everyone a chance to participate in the Q&A, we would ask that you kindly limit yourself to two questions per person. If there is time at the end you can certainly re-queue for a follow-up. So, Carol, we are now ready to take questions."
      ],
      "Louis Marcotte": [
         "Thanks, Charles, and good morning, everyone. Net operating income per share was $2.35, up 63% versus last year, driven by strong underwriting performances across North America. Before turning to our Q2 operating results, let me share a few points related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to impact communities in our markets and around the globe.",
         "We have provided significant relief, totaling more than $350 million to our customers. Included in this amount is $263 million of premium reductions, of which $134 million was written in the quarter impacting our topline by 4 points.",
         "Although, these measures are meant to compensate customers for the lower driving activity observed in Q2, the topline impact will continue to be felt in future quarters as the relief is earned.",
         "In terms of COVID-related losses, we have not changed our best estimate of $83 million booked in Q1. However, we took a prudent approach on bad debt due to the economic uncertainty and recorded a $34 million provision in Q2 2020, most of it in Canada. This represents approximately a 1.4 point impact to the expense ratio across our three lines of businesses in Canada.",
         "Overall, we expect the crisis to impact the topline in the mid-single to low double-digit range for the rest of 2020. From an underwriting perspective, the impact of the crisis is expected to be neutral for the rest of the year, although, it may vary by quarter and by line of business.",
         "Now turning to our operating results, net investment income of $141 million was down 5% compared to last year. This was mainly due to lower reinvestment yields and lower dividend income, partially offset by higher invested assets from the GCNA acquisition. Assuming the U.S. dollar and interest rates stay where they are, we continue to expect investment income in 2020 to grow between 1% and 3% compared to 2019.",
         "The distribution EBITDA and other income grew 8% to $78 million in the quarter, driven by both acquisitions and organic growth. Although, there remains uncertainty surrounding the length and severity of the crisis, we expect the growth of these earnings for the full year to be in the high-single to low double-digit range.",
         "Now let me provide some additional detail on the underwriting results beginning with Canada. In personal auto, profitability was solid in the second quarter at 84.7%. The underlying current year loss ratio improved 13 points, driven by a combination of lower driving activity, better weather conditions and our ongoing profitability actions, all of which were partially offset by higher severity and relief.",
         "Prior year development was muted in the quarter, and although, Q2 is typically a seasonally favorable quarter, cat losses were 3 points above historical averages due to two severe weather events in Alberta.",
         "In personal property, the combined ratio improved 11 points, driven by our profitability actions, better weather and fewer fire losses. On the other hand, the expense ratio increased 2.4 points, driven by a bad debt provision and higher variable commissions due to our strong underwriting performance. Overall, personal property continues to deliver a strong performance.",
         "In our Canadian commercial lines, we saw premium growth of 11% in Q2, if we exclude the impact of premium relief. The combined ratio of 95.1% reflected a solid improvement of 5.5 points in the underlying performance, which was offset by elevated cat losses, lower favorable prior year development and higher expenses.",
         "Overall, the Canadian expense ratio of 32.2% for the quarter increased 3.7 points from last year, mainly driven by an increase in the provision for bad debts, as mentioned earlier, and higher commissions.",
         "Turning to U.S. Commercial, growth was 10% in constant currency, with strong organic growth in most lines of business, as rate momentum and unit growth continues. The underlying loss ratio of 53% in the quarter improved 4.8 points, which was largely driven by the impact of our profitability actions.",
         "The cat loss ratio in the U.S. of 1.7% in the quarter was entirely weather related with no COVID losses recorded in the quarter. The increase in the U.S. expense ratio to 39.4% is consistent with our expectations and is mainly due to the addition of GCNA\u2019s surety business.",
         "All-in, I am pleased with the performance in the U.S. On a consolidated basis level, there is no doubt our business has delivered solid operating results and led to an operating ROE of 15.6%, 300 basis points above that reported in the 2019 calendar year.",
         "Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter in a strong financial position with a total capital margin of $1.7 billion and a debt to total capital ratio at 22.1%. We remain on track to reach our 20% target over the next 12 months to 18 months. We also have $300 million of cash at the holding company and our $750 million credit facility is entirely undrawn.",
         "Our book value per share increased 4% since March 31st to $53.95. Thanks to solid earnings and favorable capital markets, but offset by losses related to our pension plans. Overall, we have maintained a strong balance sheet throughout the crisis and I am confident it can absorb severe shocks or help us capture growth opportunities that may arise in these turbulent times.",
         "In closing, I would like to thank our teams across North America for stepping up for customers, suppliers and shareholders as we navigate through uncharted territory. They have shown extreme agility and flexibility to maintain our operations in top shape and deliver solid results.",
         "Finally, with our resilient operations, talented teams and strong capital position, we continue to be able to support our customers throughout this crisis. With strong fundamentals across our business on both sides of the border, we are confident that our underwriting performance will be on track for the remainder of 2020.",
         "With that, I will turn the call back to Ken."

            "Hi. Good morning. I know you talked about not changing your claims provisions relating to COVID-19. But can you talk about how many business interruption claims you have received so far and what the aggregate dollar amount that\u2019s being claimed?"

         "Speaker": "Charles Brindamour"
      },
      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. So maybe, first of all, on business interruption claims per se, our view has not changed on this during Q2, following our discussions we had at the end of Q1. I\u2019d like to remind that the language in our policies is very clear. The business interruption coverage requires direct physical damage from an insured peril to be triggered.",
            "This is the case for 99.5% of our policies in commercial lines. There\u2019s only a -- in very exceptional circumstances that we have provided limited business interruption coverage that can be triggered by a pandemic.",
            "For the most part, by the way, all claims related to these limited exceptions have been received and settled, so paid and closed as we speak. So not a lot of remaining uncertainty around that, I should say.",
            "But as expected, some groups of insureds and law firms have initiated litigation in Canada and other -- in other jurisdictions as well to -- in an attempt to challenge just interpretation. But we are -- we continue to be very confident with our defense arguments and various levels of defense we have.",
            "One of the main developments during Q2 is that a few decisions actually have started to be rendered on BI litigations. It is the case, as an example, of two federal court decisions in the states, one in Michigan and one in New York that are relating to wordings almost identical to ours.",
            "Both of those decisions have confirmed that one, physical damage to the property is necessary to trigger a BI coverage, and two, that the pandemic itself or a government mandated closure of businesses cannot be considered as physical damage to the premises. So here in Canada, none of these class action motions have been certified yet. But we are actively preparing our defense and I am very confident with our position.",
            "Now we have received a number of individual businesses that have filed for business interruptions and we have explained individually to each of them our position of coverage and why coverage would not apply. I don\u2019t have the exact number. But yes, we have seen a bit of that. So, overall, on BI, very confident in our numbers and that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t changed the $83 million overall."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Patrick Barbeau"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. And I think, Patrick, the other thing that\u2019s important here is that, the $83 million of reserve was not just BI, in fact, you have got liability, entertainment type claims. And I would say, Geoff, we have done such a rigorous analysis in Q1 doing a bottom up policy by policy assessment of what might be a COVID direct related claim that things are -- what we have seen in terms of activity has led us to not change our view of the ultimate at this stage.",
            "Maybe, Patrick, to provide color ballpark out of the provision we put, what -- how much actual case-incurred have we seen, and by case-incurred, guys, we mean file-by-file that had actually been received, so just ballpark for the group, Patrick."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Charles Brindamour"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Roughly, if I combine both Canada and U.S., we are talking about just under $30 million so far and on all the reported claims directly linked to COVID at the moment, 80% of them are already paid and closed within that $30 million."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Patrick Barbeau"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So we have got a decent visibility, I think, three months, four months in the case incurred gives us a sense that our ultimate assessment was very good and we are ready for more. Clearly, with a provision at $83 million, so that\u2019s where we stand. Darren, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything else you can add here."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Charles Brindamour"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I think the other thing, as you said Charles is that, the activity we have seen to-date is very much consistent with that bottom up exercise. There\u2019s no real surprises of misses from coverage or anything else like that, so a very consistent. So that -- for me it gives us more comfort around our $83 million ultimate view."

         "Speaker": "Darren Godfrey"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. And maybe just to add a bit of color to Patrick\u2019s point on U.S. decisions. We have talked in the previous quarter that our language was also very well supported by common law here in Canada and previous court decisions here in Canada and the decisions we have seen in the U.S. would be consistent with the common law we have seen here as well. Geoff, did I hear you or do you have a second question?"

      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. As long as I can just clarify, because when Patrick talked about the U.S. decisions and the way it was kind of described because in the U.S., I think, you guys have talked about, it\u2019s quite explicit around pandemics are not covered. But I just want to -- it sounds like what he was saying was the U.S. Court decisions were relating to a policy that had similar wording to what you have in Canada and so\u2026"

      },
      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. The debate here, like, the virus exclusion is a second, third line of defense. The real debate in BI is direct physical damage. And our language on that front compares -- is very comparable to the language in the U.S. and that\u2019s where the debate is in courts. It\u2019s not as to whether you have an exclusion or not.",
            "And in that regard, we are saying the court decisions are very clear, they are in line with what we expect, they are in line with the common law. In Canada, it\u2019s not a -- it\u2019s not gray, it\u2019s kind of pretty straightforward, and I think, the courts are in that direction."

But just whereabouts, which lines of businesses or any sort of color around that and how that might play out in upcoming quarters? In other words, is it more of a one-off or might this linger a little bit albeit a smaller amount?"

      "22": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. So essentially, it\u2019s been spread over premiums and this is where I shared about 1.4 points of impact for each line of business in the Canadian market space, which is where most of the provision was made for, so we can spread it accordingly.",
            "And then from -- how it\u2019s going to pan out here. Our view was to take a strong stance in Q2, knowing that there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace right now. We have given a lot of relief to our customers to facilitate their ability to pay for the coverage. But as the government relief unwinds, people have to pay, the delays are expiring. We are expecting some headwind there.",
            "So we have had to provide as much as we could for that in Q2 and our hope here is that we are not going to use as much as we have provided for in future quarters. But at this point, that\u2019s our best view of where the cost could be overall based on what we are seeing in terms of our data and our intelligence on the -- in the relationship with the customers."

         "Speaker": "Louis Marcotte"
      },
      "23": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I think, Geoff, one data point that I was impressed with is the fact that when people ask for help, it\u2019s because they need it. And 80% of people that have asked for a payment deferral paid the second payment and so only 20% of people that have asked for help have delayed more than one payment.",
            "And obviously, the bad debt provision -- even though we have given a lot of financing relief, the bad debt provision is aimed at those that have deferred payment three, four, five times. But the vast majority of people take this very seriously and have stepped up to stay on track in terms of paying their insurance."

And from a severity point of view, you have got a couple of things happening. One is -- and this always happens, when your mix of claims shifts, because your frequency drops, the nature of claims changes and this has an impact on severity and then there was severity to start with. I will ask Isabelle to give her perspective on what she is observing and where we think we stand now."

There\u2019s inflation coming out of this and root cause of issues in automobile insurance, Ontario being a good example, Alberta as well still need to be addressed and we will work with elected officials and regulators to make sure that we start turning our attention to reforms.",
            "I think that, look, if there is permanently less driving and less accident in the system, rates will reflect that over time from my point of view. But to the extent that the root cause of the product is not solved and the fact that the industries combined ratio is north of 100% in auto coming in the crisis, I don\u2019t see why rate corrections should not continue.",

Now if I go back pre-COVID, I would have expected in fact to start gaining some market share this year in terms of volumes and I think you kind of guided to that expectation as well. Now if I look at written insured risk trends, it\u2019s roughly flat year-over-year. So I am just trying to think like how should we view that, is that just because COVID has resulted in less vehicles being insured at the industry level or is it you have kind of pulled back on your marketing efforts in order to gain market share because of the COVID disruption? Just wondering how you are thinking about that."

In Q1 2019, when we were deep into the correction, our policies in force dropped 4.6%. I take you, let\u2019s take this six months later as the market started to change, policies in force then shrank by 2, but half the rate at which they were shrinking coming into \u201819, starting 2020, policies in force were up 2.2% and in Q2 up 2.6% this year.",
            "So for me, I see the trajectory that I am looking for in terms of our portfolio. The written risks are indeed still flat but quite different from where they were 12 months ago, where we were shrinking the business by 5%. I think that the industry was meaningfully behind us from a rate point of view, and as such, there\u2019s a time lag here, but the trajectory is there.",

And I think we are being cautious here before rebalancing our mix to what it was in the past. Now my sense is the long-term view has not changed. At some point, we will migrate back towards that mix, but in the short-term there\u2019s a bit of a preference for a caution."

How our teams are doing in this environment and the competitors we need to watch, and I will say, I am thrilled with how things are going.",

            "I mean, the bulk of the business that is not in profitability improvement at the moment is running in the 80s and these lines of business are growing at about 16% in the quarter. The lines of business where we are doing correction that are heavily on the liability front, we have seen tremendous improvement compared to last year in those segments. They are not yet at the level of profitability we are looking for to grow those and that\u2019s why when I look at these lines, we are, from a growth point of view shrinking those by 20%.",

So what this does is it helps us learn much faster and improve those solutions much faster than in a slower progression of penetration.",

We -- there are possibilities for our clients to find their claim online, track the progress, there\u2019s a lot of automated notifications that allow clients to keep track of what are the next steps in their claim, et cetera.",

So a big progression, that allows us to then accelerate also the next steps to offer to clients a more straight through processing and accelerated process.",

How we could absorb those costs to make sure our performance remain on track, and how we can take advantage of an excess supply in the system to accelerate some of our investments in technology without creating a drag to keep expenses on track.

So, in March, we -- as soon as the crisis started, we undertook a process to identify what kind of headwinds we would face in terms of costs and potentially the savings we would harvest from the crisis as well and it became fairly clear that, in fact, the savings would basically offset the cost. So we could manage through the crisis without a drag at that point.",
            "We also took on a project to actually take people that were perhaps underused in some sectors. We saw clearly that phone calls were not coming in the same volumes as usual. It\u2019s about 1,000 people that we actually redeployed in multiple areas in the business where we saw more needs, and you won\u2019t be surprised a portion of those people will have been re-affected to the AR function, for example, for collections.",
            "But we took a number of people as well to support the digital engagement processes and we took a further number of people to accelerate our digital initiatives and our developments. And so the view here was take advantage of the resources that are suddenly a bit less occupied, redeploy them in the right areas and accelerate some of the developments we are already working on.",
            "We went further than that, tried to harvest further savings from the pandemic throughout the year and those savings essentially are being reinvested in acceleration of our technology investments. So we have shifted some of that money from the savings into the investment pool if you want and with a view that overall, it would not have a significant impact on the expense ratio.",
            "It might not be totally true on a quarterly basis, but our overall view for the year, in fact, is that we come out neutral on expenses even after taking into account the bad debt. So that\u2019s how we undertook this and the view is here the very limited drag on expense ratio with accelerated development of technology."

But then commercial lines at 95% in Canada, in my mind, was a negative, and so in aggregate, I think, this was a very good, very strong, very clean quarter and we will try to keep the bottom line on track for the rest of the year.",

And when we said mid-single to low-teens with variations by quarter and line of business, we are putting the spotlight this quarter on the fact that personal auto topline next quarter will be impacted by roughly 10 points of written relief measure. We are confident though that the bottomline throughout the year will remain on track sort of in line with what one would otherwise expect our performance to be for the rest of the year."

The rest is IBNR, it\u2019s what we might receive in time for claims that have been incurred but not reported to us just yet.

And the one number is 96 in terms of the written and then to-date provided for personal lines is 198.",

So first, the mechanics of the program, which by the way we have increased to July 30th, so if you haven\u2019t called us, Tom, you still have one day to do it. So we gave -- we came out early with this, like, before any other relief measures were announced in the industry, we were out with the risk based, needs based program that basically, said, look, call us until June or now July and we will give you a break for three months. And that break turned out to be an average discount of 22%-ish.",

So that\u2019s why the written on these measures will impact other quarters as well, and then on top of that, we have mitigated rate increases in the system as well to make sure that there were no extreme dislocations or not too large dislocations in a period like this one.

So some of those policies have been issued to-date but will impact the topline only in Q3.

            "And so -- you know what -- so, I think, when you look at it by line business before the crisis, you had a good sense of what we wanted to achieve high level by line of business and really that\u2019s what we mean when we stay on track. We are saying automobiles should operate in the mid-90s.",

We are saying personal prop should be sub 95 even in bad times, and as you know, in personal prop, weather is a big component of the numbers. So it\u2019s hard to have a number. We are saying here sub 95 even in good times and the U.S. low 90s.",

So I think this was from the start one of the key questions for us go moving into that digital way of estimating damage, so we had prepared quite a few controls around that.",

And so far, I would say, that the signs are very positive, in fact, we have seen an additional precision up to now on the exact -- on the assessments that are done with this way.",
