         "Thanks, Jackie. I want to welcome everyone to the NXRT 2020 second quarter conference call. Today, we\u2019re going to discuss the highlights for the quarter. We\u2019ll spend some time analyzing Q2 results as well as the early part of Q3 through July.",
         "This is Brian Mitts. Let me start with the Q2 and year-to-date highlights. First, we announced last week on July 27 that the Board elected to expand the composition of the Board from 5 to 6 members. And we added Catherine Wood as an Independent Director.",
         "We believe Cathy brings significant experience and a unique perspective to the Board. So we\u2019re glad to welcome her on. Net loss for the quarter was $9.3 million or negative $0.38 per diluted share, as compared to a $2 million loss or negative $0.08 per diluted share in Q2 of 2019. Same-store NOI increase for the quarter is $1.1 million or an increase of 5.8% as compared to Q2 2019.",
         "We\u2019re reporting Q2 2020 Core FFO of $14.5 million or $0.59 cents per diluted share, which is an increase of 31.1% on a per share basis as compared to Q2 2019. Total Revenue for Q2 was $50.7 million and total NOI was $29.2 million, which represents an increase of 17.6% and 18.9% year-over-year respectively.",
         "NOI margins for Q2 were 57.6%, which was a 50 basis point improvement over margins in Q2 of 2019 of 57.1%. We continue to execute our value-add business plan by completing 411 full and partial renovations during the quarter, with 392 upgraded units leased, achieving an average monthly rent premium of $113 and 23.4% ROI during the quarter.",
         "Inception-to-date in the portfolio as of June 30, we\u2019ve completed 7,325 full and partial upgrades achieving an average monthly rent premium of $95 and a return on investment of 25%.",
         "Through our equity repurchase program we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of stock through Q2 of 2020 at an average repurchase price of $25.70 per share. We ended the quarter with $85 million of cash.",
         "On our NAV per share, given the unprecedented disruption of economy over what is also an unprecedentedly short period of time, cap rates become difficult to judge, although we do have more clarity today than we did after Q1. Nevertheless, we\u2019re updating our NAV based on our revised outlook for NOI and cap rates. And Matt will discuss this in some detail on his prepared remarks.",
         "Based on our updates in cap rates and NOI, we revised our NAV per share as follows: $34.37 on the low-end, $42.31 on the high-end, for a midpoint of $38.34. That\u2019s compared to midpoint of $38.47 in the prior quarter or 33 basis point quarter-over-quarter decrease and a midpoint of $37.51 at June 30 of last year or a 2.21% year-over-year increase.",
         "For dividends, for the first quarter we paid a dividend of 31 \u2013 sorry, for the second quarter, paid a dividend of $0.3125 per share on June 30 to shareholders of record as of June 15. And last Monday, the Board declared a dividend per share of $0.3125 cents per share payable on September 30 to shareholders of record on September 15. Year to date, our dividend is 1.77 times covered by Core FFO for a payout ratio of 56% of Core FFO.",
         "Overall, just big picture, our rent collections are stronger than we anticipated in Q2, and I think maybe better than everybody anticipated across the industry. And that trend continued into July. And Matt will give some details around that.",
         "Our biggest attractor to higher revenue was our inability to charge late fees or process evictions. The moratorium on evictions under the CARES Act ended July 27. However, we\u2019re still restricted in certain markets. And to the extent we can process evictions, we\u2019re doing so thoughtfully.",
         "Also, a number of local governments are offering assistance to residents and we\u2019re encouraging our residents to take advantage of that, and also helping them to find information and/or complete applications for that. The next big event that we\u2019re watching closely is the new stimulus package, or in lieu with that, how that \u2013 the withdrawal of stimulus may impact our results overall and our ability for tenants to make rent collections.",
         "However, given the force nature of the situation, unprecedented decline in the economy and increase in unemployment, not to mention the fact that it\u2019s a major election year, we continue to believe that some sort of stimulus will be forthcoming. However, we also believe that in new stimulus bill is not impact \u2013 past the impact, maybe less than perhaps people expect. Evidence of this is a decline in assistance requested by our residents throughout the quarter into July, and just the general strength of our portfolio performance since COVID. And the non-payment of rents is only impactful the extent we can\u2019t a bit non-paying tenants, which we\u2019ve been forbidden to do up until just last week.",
         "In that regard, any additional stimulus is likely to be a double-edged sword with the carrot of more stimulus, which may help some tenants make payments. But the stick is that we can\u2019t. We have a continued extension of moratoriums on eviction. We continue to see strong demand for our product in most markets, which is evidenced by our results, as well as the demand that we\u2019ve seen on our upgraded units, where we\u2019ve been able to drive strong rent increases. And Matt is going to get to that in a little more detail as well.",
         "One of the reasons that we see a strong demand for our products, and it\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked about historically, and we\u2019re starting to see now is a trade down effect. We believe this was a factor in 2008, 2009 and beyond, but essentially a tenant in a product decides to trade down to one of our renovated units, saving money, but sacrificing little in the way of quality or amenities. And we think this is probably very underappreciated part of our strategy and our story.",
         "Net-net, all these factors have resulted in strong NOI growth, relatively strong new lease rent growth in most of our markets, strong renewal rent growth and occupancy compared to our public peers and far better than smaller private operators. So although some of the unknowns remain around COVID, we believe that after 5 months, we have a lot more transparency and understanding of how this is going to impact our business and believe that we\u2019re well positioned for the future. When we go through some of the details on results, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Matt.",
         "Total revenues for the second quarter of $50.7 million versus $43.1 million for the same period in 2019 to 17.7% increase. NOI was $29.2 million in second quarter 2020 versus $24.6 million last year for 18.9% increase. Core FFO increased to $0.59 per diluted share from $0.45, which is a 31.1% increase on a per share basis.",
         "Same store rent increased 2.1% year-over-year for the quarter. Same store occupancy increased 120 basis points for the quarter year-over-year, which we\u2019re excited about. That\u2019s a strong number. Same store revenue increased 4% for the quarter year-over-year. And that\u2019s 5% increase in rental income and a 31% decrease in other income driven mostly by the inability to charge late fees and other types of fees.",
         "Same store NOI was $20.2 million versus $19.1 million in the same quarter last year for 5.8% same store NOI increase. Year-to-date our total revenues are $103.3 million versus $84.6 million for the same period of 2019, which is a 22.1% increase.",
         "NOI is $59.2 million year-to-date 2020 versus $48.2 million last year for a year-over-year 22.9% increase. Core FFO was $1.11 per diluted share versus $0.91 per diluted share last year for 21.4% increase. Same store rent increase year-to-date is 1.9%. Same-store occupancies increased 100 basis points for 2020 versus the same period in 2019.",
         "Same story on same store revenue year-to-date high increase in rental revenue, 5.4% increase, but a decrease in other income. Same store NOI is $36 million year-to-date for 2020 versus 34.2% \u2013 $34.2 million last year for a 5.3% increase in same store NOI year-t-date.",
         "So that let me turn it over to Matt to fill in some of the details for the quarter and year-to-date.",
         "Thanks, Matt. Let\u2019s go ahead and turn it over for questions."

      "Jackie Graham": [
         "Thank you. Good day, everyone, and welcome to NexPoint Residential Trust\u2019s conference call to review the company\u2019s results for the second quarter ended June 30.",
         "On the call today are Brian Mitts, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt McGraner, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. As a reminder, this call is being webcast through the company\u2019s website at www.nexpointliving.com.",

         "These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding NXRT\u2019s business and industry in general, the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the company, NXRT\u2019s 2020 adjusted NOI estimate and the related assumptions, NXRT\u2019s strategy for the third quarter and full year 2020, NXRT\u2019s net asset value and its related components and assumptions, planned value-add programs, including projected average rent, rent change and return on investment, and expected acquisitions and dispositions.",

         "I would now like to turn the call over to Brian Mitts, please go ahead, Brian."
      ],
      "Matt McGraner": [
         "Yeah. Thanks, Brian. We were extremely pleased with the operational performance of the portfolio during the quarter, especially given these difficult times. The property and asset management team to be a next point to BH and NexPoint are operating at high levels and the performance this quarter demonstrates their talents and the durability of our company\u2019s investment thesis, namely that well located affordable Class B apartments and Sunbelt should continue to produce durable cash flows even during the most challenging operating environments.",
         "As Brian mentioned, same store NOI grew by 5.8% year-over-year, it was 20 basis points sequentially better than the first quarter. We saw strength across most of the portfolio during the quarter with 7 out of our 10 markets growing NOI assumption by 4% or better, including Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Phoenix, Nashville, West Palm and Tampa. Notably, Tampa, West Palm and Phoenix, all grew NOI by double-digits during the quarter.",
         "On the operational front leasing activity and revenue growth were better than expected during the second quarter. New lease rates were slightly negative down 1% and down 3%, excluding rehab units, but renewals were positive and increased by 2.3% across the portfolio for a blended positive rate change during the quarter 54 basis points. Our top Q2 value added programs. Revenue growth during the quarter were Dallas-Fort Worth, Charlotte, Nashville, Phoenix, Tampa and West Palm posting 4% or better revenue growth.",
         "Houston made this list as well during the quarter surprised the upside for us. Our quote unquote weakest markets for the revenue \u2013 for revenue growth during the quarter were Las Vegas and Orlando, but were only down modestly. Las Vegas revenues were down 73 basis points from the first quarter. Orlando revenue was down 4.8% year-over-year, but only 1.2% quarter-over-quarter. Overall occupancy for the portfolio grew 90 basis points year-over-year, and finished the second quarter for us at historically strong 95.3%.",
         "Renewal retention for the quarter was an all-time high for the company as well at 57.9%. Collection activity for the quarter ended at 96.5% and ultimately finished 98.1% as of the end of July. Markets below the portfolio average worst follows: Las Vegas at 95.9%, and Atlanta and Orlando both at 97.3%. Importantly, as of July 31, only 5 basis points or 70 units out of 14,104 units were unaccounted for, meaning we have seen no rent payments from such residents during the quarter.",
         "For July, our preliminary operating performance metrics are as follows. July occupancy finished the month at 95% rent collections for the month totaled a strong 99.1%, including payment plans, with Las Vegas being the only market below 97% and 95.6%. July new leases and renewals were positive 1.5% \u2013 1.52% and 1.96%, with a blended positive rate change of 1.72%.",
         "Now on to our Q2 value added programs. You may recall, our Q2 rehab pipeline base case was previously revised lower to 225 upgrades. We are pleased to report that we completed 411 rehabs leasing 392 of them for a blended ROI of 23.4% again demonstrating consistent demand for upgraded, but still affordable housing product. We completed rehab in every market to solve particular demand in Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Phoenix and Nashville.",
         "Our largest asset of [Vaughn] [ph] at Timber Pines, we completed 22 interior upgrades during the quarter achieving a 17% ROI on leased units. Even our Las Vegas assets demonstrated demand for upgraded products, realizing 14% revenue growth on 34 rehab units. For the third quarter, we had budgeted 540 interiors fairly evenly distributed amongst all the markets with the exceptions that we plan to upgrade over 100 units in Dallas Fort Worth, but almost not in Houston in Orlando.",
         "In the fourth quarter, we expect to complete 290 interior upgrades, again largely evenly distributed across our markets with the exceptions of Houston and Orlando, bringing the annual expectations to 1,900 units or approximately 75% of 2019 space, not bad given the circumstances.",
         "On the transaction front, we are pleased to announce that we have signed a contract to sell Eagle Crest, an asset located in Dallas-Fort Worth that we purchased in 2014, for $55.5 point generating approximately a 5.2 times multiple on invested capital and unlevered IRR 35%. The purchaser currently has a meaningful amount of non-refundable earnest money in escrow and closing is expected to occur in the third quarter. This purchase price represents a 4.75% nominal cap rate, which is tax adjusted on T3 revenues over T12 expenses.",
         "For the rest of my prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to update our stress test scenarios and provide some observations operationally for the rest of the year. First, we expected and work through a challenging leasing and operating environment during the quarter. We do expect this environment to continue. You may recall we underwrote bad debt to reach over 4% for the year increasing to over 8 times from our historical average. We hit bad debt particularly hard in q2 thinking it could reach as high as 8% and then level off in Q3 and Q4.",
         "Recall also that we assumed rents would go modestly negative April through September, and they remain flat for the year. We underwrote physical occupancy to 92.9% economic occupancy declined to 89%. Fairly modest savings were expressed on controllable expenses. And then further recall, that these draconian assumptions still yielded a $2 per share core FFO for the year result.",
         "Obviously Q2 bad debt performance in general have outperformed our expectations for the quarter, given our release today, as affordable housing in our suburban Sunbelt markets have continued to demonstrate resiliency. Given this Q2 performance, we have taken a step back and considered what we need to go wrong in order for our portfolio to still produce a $2 share Core FFO performance for the year, which again is modestly up $0.07 from last year and incrementally and relatively positive, as compared to our public peers.",
         "In sum, even if revenues were down 4% for the second half of the year and vacancy losses increased from a budget of 5.4% to 7% of GPR and bad debt rose to 4% or tripled from the first half of the year, we still believe we could produce a $2 a share of core earnings for the year.",
         "Finally, on the NAV price, despite the Eagle Crest transaction, and as Brian mentioned, the only changes we made this quarter was to plug-in actual Q2 NOI, reflect repurchase activity and reflect the fair value [given] [ph] on our swap book, which reduced our NAV midpoint by a modest $0.13 per share to $38.34.",
         "So that\u2019s it from my prepared remarks. But in closing, I just want to thank our teams at VH and NexPoint for all the hard work during these difficult times."

            "Yeah, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s market dependent. Obviously, markets that are stronger, for example, Phoenix and South Florida, where we can just rehab more, I think that we\u2019ve seen \u2013 and, again, as I mentioned, demand rise in those markets. I think Dallas-Fort Worth, Charlotte, Phoenix and South Florida. We didn\u2019t think we would budget as many during the quarter, but ultimately did increase our revised pipeline numbers, because of that demand. So I think that there are trade-down effects in these organically strong markets with $1,000 affordable rent."

And then, going forward, in terms of the new acquisitions that we do, if any, it will be interesting to see, but I think that we\u2019ll hone in on markets that are showing or demonstrating the growth that we\u2019re seeing right now like Phoenix and South Florida, Charlotte, et cetera."

Once we put somebody on a payment plan and they\u2019re 60 days or more out, that\u2019s when we start to write it off pretty aggressively. And then, once we get past, up to 120 days, it\u2019s completely written off unless they\u2019ve been making payments toward it.",

            "Yeah, I mean, I think it\u2019s not surprising to us that we can still hit pre-COVID pricing given where interest rates are right now. New acquisition buyers can obtain agency financing into the 70% range at 2.75% to 3%, which you take a 4.75% cap and you layer that on, you can still produce a desirable cash-on-cash yield. Yeah, the geographical dispersion between, markets with evictions or higher bad debt, I think you\u2019ll see harder hits to pricing expectations.",
            "But for Dallas largely, we think that 4.75% cap or the cap rates expressed in our NAV on a nominal basis are going to be pretty steady for the rest of the year. And plus for just the market being right now there\u2019s just not a lot of product. So there is a scarcity to it, that we thought we would take advantage of and produce a little bit of liquidity, have a nice print, price discovery and really it\u2019s a pre-COVID pricing."

And then we added back to the core FFO just reflected in there. The fact that it\u2019s not really a part of our overall operations, but at the same time, we\u2019re getting the income, but we\u2019re \u2013 as we would on any casualty loss, we\u2019ll reverse it out of Core FFO.",

And so they\u2019ve got balances that they\u2019re carrying. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to highlight here is that most of the balances are spread across a very few number of tenants.",
            "In some cases, there are tenants that just have been completely unresponsive to our outreach. And I think are kind of writing this moratorium on evictions to our detriment, probably ultimately their detriment. But, Matt, you want to talk to the details?"

            "And so, the way I look at this from a positive perspective is that everyone, there is only 840 residents as of the end of July that were delinquent. And then, you showed the dispersion across the markets, obviously, Vegas, Orlando were some of the larger ones. But over \u2013 most of those \u2013 most of the 840, which isn\u2019t that much across the portfolio has paid.",
            "And then, really no payments, it\u2019s only 70, which is 5 basis points of the portfolio, which I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And, so I didn\u2019t like it at first. But I think it is a helpful in depiction on \u2013 in terms of progress and just breaks out by market."

And then, the last question from me, it\u2019s obviously too soon to talk about August, but as you saw improvement in July, at the same time the cases were surging, Florida, Texas and Arizona, especially were all in the news every day, and that\u2019s a big chunk of your portfolio, obviously. I mean, are there any signs or \u2013 I don\u2019t know how cases match up with \u2013 exactly match up with employment or who pays rent.",

We expect that to continue into August. Our markets didn\u2019t absorb as many job losses as the gateway markets did. So I think that that kind of makes up for some of it, but by and large most of our markets are not correlating in terms of demand.",
            "It\u2019s down, if you will, from COVID, I think July is really hopefully an indicator of future activity in our markets and short answer is we haven\u2019t seen a correlation between the 2."
