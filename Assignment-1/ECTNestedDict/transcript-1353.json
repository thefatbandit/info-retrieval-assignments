      "Geoff Martin": [
         "Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everybody. Just before we start the call with the numbers, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute, just a couple of words about the impact of COVID on our operations. All of our plants now globally are working. We have some employees still working from home, in locations where we have offices, but all of our plant operations are running. We have 29 confirmed case \u2013 positive cases currently as of the end of June. We probably had another 100 or so more than that of people who\u2019ve had it and since recovered. And I\u2019d like to thank all the employees of CCL globally for their monumental efforts in getting us through this crisis.",
         "So with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Sean and he\u2019ll take you through the numbers.",
         "Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everybody. I\u2019m on Slide 7, highlights the capital spending, which we pulled down at the end of Q1 to around $250 million. And we\u2019ve increased it to a range of $275 million to $290 million really as a reflection of business not declining as much as we thought it might do as we went into the quarter. And a couple of our businesses, particularly in the CCL\u2019s segment firing on all cylinders, and we need to support them. So \u2013 but we\u2019re still expecting to come in 20% to 25% below our original budget of $360 million in the $275 million to $290 million range. That\u2019s below annual depreciation and amortization.",
         "Slide 8, highlights of CCL. We had a 6.1% organic sales decline, a little contribution from acquisitions and more or less offset by negative FX. Regionally, North America was down mid-single digits. Asia Pacific and Europe were down low double digit. I\u2019ll just clarify, the Asia Pacific number was a combination of a low single-digit growth in the Asian countries, offset by double-digit growth in Australia and South Africa. Latin America was up mid-single digit.",
         "We had strong sales gains in our electronics \u2013 CCL Design Electronics business and our Healthcare & Specialty business, modest decline in Home & Personal Care. I\u2019ll give you some color on that in a minute. A moderate decline in Food & Beverage and significant decline in CCL Secure, which we\u2019ll talk about shortly, and a severe decline in the automotive industry.",
         "Slide 9, just the numbers of our joint ventures. We got a \u2013 we\u2019ve now moved out of Rheinfelden\u2019s slug plants, which is now part of CCL Container. So now the results just include our label operations in the Middle East and in Russia, and they both had quite good quarters. So we\u2019re pleased with that.",
         "Avery, this is the business that\u2019s been one of the businesses most impacted by the changes in the pandemic. We had a very slow April when the pandemic first hit and the lockdowns came in. We had a moderate sequential gain in May. But June really bounced back much stronger than we anticipated and was actually above prior year. That on a calendar works day basis, there are two additional workdays for \u2013 in the month of June. So if you adjust for that, we were probably down mid-single digits in the month of June at Avery.",
         "The back-to-school selling was strong, but significant uncertainty of consumer pull-through around school and reopenings in the U.S. remains, and we\u2019ll answer some questions around that in the Q&A. Direct-to-consumer was mixed. The WePrint label segment was very strong. Kids' labels was so-so, not too bad in Europe, but were pretty down in North America. And our event badge demand is more or less halted as you wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear.",
         "Moving on to Checkpoint. Our MAS or Merchandise Availability business, it was down moderately in Asia Pacific. So we had good results in China and not too bad in Japan. So the downturn there again was mainly in Australia. We\u2019re down significantly in Europe and even more so in the Americas. April was weak. May was slightly better and June was much better, but the same comment again with the two additional workdays. June was almost \u2013 sales in June almost reached prior-year levels. But again, you have to factor in the workday adjustment. Apparel label sales were down significantly in April, less so in May and also bounced back in June, and about \u2013 were quite a bit above prior year, aided by record monthly RFID sales.",
         "Moving on to Slide 12, Innovia. This business performed extremely strongly in the quarter. Volume is up significantly organically well into double digits, partly aided by pantry loading impact in April and May, and particularly in the month of April. It eased off in May and eased off again in June. Profitability increased on volume in the main product and asset utilization, and we did have some positive FX gains on the impact of a strong U.S. dollar on locations where we export film from. The lower Q1 resin costs were largely passed through in Q2. So there was very little resin benefit in the second quarter. Better than expected contribution from the Polish acquisition has made a solid profit in its first full quarter.",
         "So just a few comments here on our outlook. Home & Personal Care in the CCL space, we still saw some downturn in the specialty retail salon and cosmetic brands in Q2. And we\u2019ve seen some pickup of that in some parts of the business in July, but it\u2019s still in certain product lines that are still impacted, particularly in hair care salons.",
         "Healthcare & Specialty demand looks stable. Over-the-counter pantry loading has definitely come to an end. The Food & Beverage \u2018on premise\u2019 issue, which has been a big problem for many of our carbonated soft drinks, mineral waters and beer customers. So we kind of lost the high season, which normally is in the spring and the summer months just due to the lockdowns that have been present globally.",
         "Electronics demand was continues to be solid and we\u2019ve begun to see a slow recovery in automotive. We made a pretty solid profit in that part of the business in the month of July. CCL Secure second half looks good. Cash unbelievably was counterintuitive, is in high demand, and the government plants which we mentioned at the end of Q1 that were closed has since been reopened.",
         "At Avery in direct-to-consumer, we don\u2019t really see much change. Distributed products demand did improve, in the end of \u2013 particularly in the first half of July and for all of July in internationally, but we did see in the last two weeks of July is slowing in North America as the Sun Belt states continue to have many challenges. And we\u2019re certainly seeing that in back-to-school demand in July, and we think that will go on in August, unless there\u2019s a sudden change of heart in state governments about return to school.",
         "At Checkpoint, this is the high season for our MAS business. That depends on retail opening. We had a good July in ALS and the summer is typically a seasonally slow period. So the good July I think was some catching up of demand that have been in place that would have otherwise been fulfilled earlier in the quarter. The winter season really depends on what happens with retail opening and how retailers feel about merchandising efforts for the holiday and winter season, and that\u2019s a big unknown. Our small Meto business improved in Germany on retail, they are opening.",
         "Innovia. Well, the volume is still stable, but pantry loading is clearly over. So we have seen the backlogs come down. Raw material indices have turned up, particularly in the United States. But we do expect our Polish business to continue to exceed expectations and where we transform the business.",
         "Few comments on the outlook. July results were solid. Pretty good at \u2013 particularly at CCL and Innovia, but we\u2019re also decent at both Avery and Checkpoint. But we do expect both of those businesses still to be down until non-essential retail normalizes. CCL and Innovia, stable overall but with many puts and takes. Giving you some color on that. We do expect to incur some restructuring cost in the second half of the year largely in the affected businesses of Checkpoint, Avery and to some extent at CCL Design Automotive. All derived commodities have begun to rise. FX looks pretty neutral to us at today\u2019s rates. And we\u2019re retaining target of trying to make $450 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2020.",
         "So with that, operator, we\u2019d like to open the call up for questions."

      "Operator": [
         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the CCL Industries' second quarter investor update. Please note that there will be a question-and-answer session after the call. The moderator for today is Mr. Geoff Martin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and joining him is Mr. Sean Washchuk, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, gentlemen."
      ],
      "Sean Washchuk": [
         "Thanks, Jake. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CCL\u2019s second quarter call. This is Sean speaking. I\u2019d like to turn everyone\u2019s attention to Page 2 of this presentation and draw everyone\u2019s attention to our updated disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements. I\u2019ll remind everyone that our business faces known and unknown risks and opportunities. For further details of these key risks, please take a look at our 2019 annual report and second quarterly report in the MD&A sections, particularly this section under risks and uncertainties. Our annual and quarterly reports can be found online at the company\u2019s website cclind.com or on sedar.com. Jeff?",
         "Thank you, Jeff. So turning to Slide number 3, our summary of the second quarter results, the six months results. For the second quarter of 2020, sales declined including the positive impact of currency translation by 9.8%, partially offset by acquisition-related sales growth of 2.2% resulting in sales of $1.22 billion compared to $1.35 billion in the second quarter of 2019. Operating income was $163.6 million for the 2020 second quarter compared to $198.7 million for the second quarter of 2019, an 18% decline including the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Jeff will expand on the segmented operating results of our CCL, Avery, Checkpoint and Innovia segments momentarily.",
         "Included in the second quarter results was a $7.3 million reduction in corporate expenses due to a decrease in short-term and long-term variable compensation for the comparative periods. Consolidated EBITDA for the 2020 second quarter, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, decreased approximately 9% compared to the same period in 2019. Net finance expense was $15.9 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $20.6 million for the second \u2013 2019 second quarter. The decrease in net finance costs is attributed to lower average interest rates and lower average debt outstanding for the comparative quarterly periods.",
         "The overall effective tax rate was 25.1% for the 2020 second quarter, slightly less than the 25.6% effective tax rate recorded for the second quarter of 2019. The effective tax rate may change in future periods depending on the proportion of taxable income earned in different tax jurisdictions with different rates. Net earnings for the 2020 second quarter were $103.9 million, down 15% excluding foreign currency translation compared to $121.3 million for the 2019 second quarter.",
         "For the 6 months period, sales declined 6%. Operating income declined approximately 10% and net earnings dropped 5% compared to the 6-month period in 2019. 2020 included results from 12 acquisitions completed since January 1, 2019 delivering acquisition-related sales growth for the period of 1.7%, organic sales decline of 7.7% and foreign currency translation headwind of 1/3 of a $0.01 on sales.",
         "Moving to Slide 4. Basic earnings per Class B share was $0.58 for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $0.68 for the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted basic earnings per Class B share were $0.59 for the 2020 second quarter compared to adjusted basic earnings per Class B share of $0.69 for the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in adjusted basic EPS to $0.59 is primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income of $0.15, offset by $0.05 of improvement from finance costs and corporate expenses.",
         "For the 2020 six-month period, the $0.09 decline in adjusted basic earnings per Class B share was due to a decrease in operating income and a slight negative impact from foreign currency translation amounting to $0.18, partially offset by a decrease in net interest expense and corporate expenses accounting for $0.09 per share. This resulted in adjusted basic earnings per share of $1.31 for the 2020 6-month period compared to $1.40 for the 2019 six-month period.",
         "Moving to Slide 5. For the second quarter of 2020, free cash flow from operations improved $39.4 million compared to the 2019 second quarter. The improvement can be primarily attributed to a decline in capital spending for the comparative quarters. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2020, free cash flow from operations improved $177 million compared to the last 12 months ended June 30, 2019. This comparative improvement is attributable to the change in working capital and reduced capital spending for the comparative 12-month periods.",
         "Moving to Slide 6, the cash and debt summary. Net debt as of June 30, 2020 was $1.9 billion, an increase of approximately $151 million compared to December 31, 2019. The increase primarily reflects the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt as at December 31, 2019 to June 30, 2020 increasing total Canadian dollar reported debt on the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents declined $84.2 million as the funds were used largely to finance the company\u2019s investing activities in the six months period, which included 6 business acquisitions.",
         "The company\u2019s balance sheet closed the quarter in a strong position. Our bank leverage ratio was approximately 1.78 times, declining from 1.9 times at the end of the first quarter of 2020. Liquidity was robust with $619.4 million of cash on hand and USD 1.2 billion of available undrawn credit capacity on the company\u2019s revolving bank credit facility. The company does not have any significant debt maturities until its term loan comes due in 2022.",
         "The company\u2019s overall finance rate was 2.1% at June 30, 2020, lower than the 2.3% average at December 31, 2019 due to the decrease in interest rates on the company\u2019s variable drawn debt. In absence of any significant acquisitions, management expects to continue delevering the company\u2019s balance sheet through 2020.",

Geoff, can you talk a bit about what \u2013 where were the areas of the biggest surprise? What areas came in better than expected versus the down 15% to 20% that you\u2019ve been guiding to after the first quarter?"

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, I think the best way to answer that is the monthly cadence overall, Walter. It was \u2013 April was at the low end of our 15% to 20% range. May was at the high end of the 15% to 20% range, and then everything came back strong in the month of June with the exception of automotive. So automotive was still a drag in June. But Checkpoint improved very significantly. Avery improved very significantly. And the CCL businesses were pretty steady all the way through the quarter."

            "And then my last question here is really on your positioning coming out of COVID-19 and operating leverage. That\u2019s a big focus for a lot of the companies we cover. I\u2019ll ask it this way, Geoff. If you have the same volumes, whatever period in the future, do you expect based on how you\u2019ll bring resources back on to be at similar margin levels? Or is there an opportunity to in fact because of what you\u2019ve learned from COVID and because you\u2019re bringing resources on rather than taking them off now, could you run better margins on the same volume going forward?"

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a factor for our company, Walter. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re a job shop. So our average order size for our transactions is quite a low number. So where we\u2019ve made variable cost cuts as business comes back, they\u2019ll come back with it. We haven\u2019t had material benefit from financially from the changes of COVID. Just we\u2019ve laid off some labor where \u2013 in businesses where demand evaporated. But the impact of volume in the way you are talking about, that\u2019ll be slim to none."

         ],
         "Speaker": "Mark Neville"
      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Very difficult. Avery is more difficult than Checkpoint because it\u2019s that back-to-school quarter. So typically the way that works is you have \u2013 the preplanned orders go out at the back end of June and the first part of July. And then you get replenishments in the second half of July and August. And it\u2019s a U.S. driven business really. So I think what we\u2019re concerned about is what the back-to-school impact is going to be. And as \u2013 if we take populations of California, Florida and Texas, that\u2019s I think 100 million people or more. So if schools aren\u2019t going to go back there, then demand for some of the back-to-school items that we have in these stores is going to be impacted and we won\u2019t get the replenishment business.",
            "But it\u2019s very hard to say because it\u2019s day by day and week by week. But that\u2019s our biggest concern for the quarter at Avery is how that will impact us. But in July, we were down \u2013 we were certainly down double digits at Avery and revenues not far off profit wise because we had some better mix and better margin products in the programs this year. Checkpoint was better than that, but \u2013 and was slightly above \u2013 slightly better profits this year than we had last year. So that\u2019s looking a little better. But I think both businesses, until you can go into a shopping mall and a store on a normal business \u2013 in a normal basis, it\u2019d be hard for either of those businesses to sort of get back to the place they were. And then you have to remember at Avery, we have got that badge business that\u2019s driven by convention, sports events, rock concerts. So there, it\u2019s close to $100 million and the demand there is \u2013 it\u2019s not zero, but it\u2019s not far from it."

I was just sort of curious your thoughts around M&A now sort of being as you\u2019re \u2013 while you\u2019re working through see chilling more comp. Again, I know diligence may be here with travel restrictions, but the higher level. Anything about that?"

And \u2013 but we\u2019re pretty active in the bolt-on space and valuations in that area have normalized, I would say because the private equity firms, they\u2019re not as shut out of the credit markets, but they\u2019re very different from the way they were. So we\u2019re pretty active in that space. But until we can travel again, I think doing a large transaction wouldn\u2019t be a sensible thing for us to do."

And so we\u2019re doing what we can with the constraints we have. And travel is still \u2013 even in Europe, it\u2019s still very, very constrained. And when we \u2013 well, I think one of the reasons we\u2019ve been successful with M&A as we like to see the color of people\u2019s eyes when we make transactions and that\u2019s an important factor in the decisions we make, and that\u2019s difficult to do in today as well."

Again, just trying to \u2013 we can come up around assumptions for sort of profitability, but just on working capital, is there going to be \u2013 if it\u2019s an investment sort of source of cash for the year just and try to help us sort off."

And I do think we \u2013 I think volumes will be pretty volatile in the third quarter because they were very strong from really March, April, a good chunk of May because the orders were coming in and we hadn\u2019t shipped them. June, we saw some tail off and July, we\u2019ve seen some tail off. So \u2013 but the business is operating at a much, much better tick than it was.",
            "So internally, we\u2019ve made significant progress in the management of the plants. So that\u2019s going really well. We had some resin benefit in Q1, not a lot in Q2 because of the pass-through to the customers. And so second half will be very difficult to predict because there\u2019re so many moving parts and some of it affected by what\u2019s going on with the pandemic. So well, hard to say."

And then retailers who had begun to do RFID, we saw the RFID impact to that. So that\u2019s really what drove it. A little bit of share gain in a couple of customers in Europe, but that\u2019s the main driver."

And there are also bothersome indications from second waves coming in Europe. So it\u2019s very hard for us to say when this is going to be over because we\u2019ve sort of our larger and more profitable businesses clearly affected by workplace interruptions and non-essential retailing being locked down.",

And until we see that normalizing, it\u2019s very difficult to predict the longer haul. In China, where we \u2013 where things are more or less back to business as usual, we\u2019re seeing things a lot better there, but it\u2019s only one part of the world."

And then just talk about what June \u2013 you thought June was exactly. Was it inventory restocking? Was it just the natural opening of all these economies and there wasn\u2019t necessarily an inventory rebuilding component to it?

But May work days were \u2013 we run a calendar month here. So May workdays were low compared to May last year. So that had an impact. And then in June, we were above prior year total company. So we had actually some low single-digit organic growth in the month of June. But you have to remember, we had two workdays.",
            "So two extra workdays. So if you adjust for that, we were down, like I said, probably mid-single digits in the month of June for the total company. And the sales impact is really predominantly in those three businesses I mentioned. So Avery, which you\u2019ve got the numbers there for it. Checkpoint, you have the numbers in there. Our CCL Design Automotive business was down in around 45%.",
            "So that\u2019s a $300 million slug of the CCL segment. So if you took the \u2013 if you had a normal automotive season, we would have been up in the CCL space in both revenue and profits. So I think it\u2019s just a \u2013 those are the three businesses where we saw the main impact. I mean, in Food & Beverage, we definitely have seen impact from this on-premise issues. So carbonated soft drinks companies, mineral water companies, beer companies. You\u2019ve seen all their numbers. They\u2019re all down 15% to 20% in volume.",
            "And some of that, they\u2019ve picked back up in at-home consumption. But a bottle of water, you pick up at a travel store, that\u2019s gone into the tank. Coca cola, if you get your glass bottle and sitting at the St. Mark\u2019s Square in Venice with a cup of coffee, that\u2019s gone. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 that hasn\u2019t really changed very much as we go into July and we\u2019re still seeing \u2013 it\u2019s better than it was, but not \u2013 but it\u2019s still down compared to anything like normal in the summer season driven by tourism and all the rest of it."

So because I think it\u2019s not only will schools reopen, but when will they reopen and what will the behavior be when they do.

So not quite sure why that would be, but maybe it\u2019s to do with the very generous \u2013 it\u2019s 5p Mr. Trump has been handing out.

So we won\u2019t see \u2013 the volume gains we saw in Q2 in the second half because it\u2019s a onetime phenomenon. And it also happened in the \u2013 we did pass on almost all of the resin benefit we had in Q1 and Q2, and resins have begun to rise in the second half of the year. So we\u2019ll be \u2013 so we may get some price benefit in the second half around that, which will impact the top line.
