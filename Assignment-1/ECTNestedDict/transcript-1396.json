         "Thank you, Giulia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the presentation of Generali's first half results 2020. Before we open the floor for questions, let me highlight our four key messages. First, the results we present today confirm that Generali is resilient, both from a financial and operating standpoint and that we are able to withstand the unprecedented challenge posed by COVID-19.",
         "Our operating result at \u20ac2.7 billion was in line with that of the first half of the year 2019 when we achieved a record high figure. We confirmed once again our technical excellence with a combined ratio at 89.5% and a new business margin at 3.94%. And our solid position from a capital perspective with the solvency ratio at 194%. Second, at Generali, we promptly reacted to the COVID situation, acting like a true lifetime partner to all our customers, our agents and all stakeholders. We put in place many initiatives to support them at this critical juncture, and we implemented a number of business actions that helped mitigate the effects of the crisis. Third, we confirm our outlook for the remainder of the year, whilst being conscious of the persisting uncertainty about the socioeconomic and financial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect our operating result to be resilient this year, thanks to a favorable business mix and a robust standard policy terms, albeit with a likely decrease compared to 2019. Fourth, we continue to execute our strategy. Our Generali 2021 strategy, we executed in a disciplined way, while accelerating on some initiatives such as digital transformation and adapting to the changing scenario. At the same time, we are ready to capture any opportunities, any good opportunities that might arise, and we will provide a full update on the progress on our strategic plan on our Investor Day which will be held virtually, of course, on November 18.",
         "Thank you very much for your time, for your attention. And together with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Cristiano, we will be happy to answer your questions. Thank you."

Firstly was on Switzerland where you've taken some reserve strengthening, but it sounds like there might still be quite a lot to come with a similar in H2, and you said negative operating result for 2021. Just wondering if you could give us a bit more color on this, and why can you not take the whole hit upfront? And finally, when do we think we'll get back to profitability for Switzerland? So that's the first question. Second question is on M&A. You've got a stake in Cattolica. You've been linked with Borsa Italiana, neither of which really seems naturally set into your core M&A focus. Could you give us a bit more color on these and what we should think about the M&A strategy? And then thirdly was just on P&C claims frequency. I just really wondered if you could give a bit of color on how things have changed since lockdowns started to ease. Do you still see COVID as being fairly neutral to maybe even slightly positive for the P&C business in H2?"

So it's a very disciplined strategy on the insurance. It's focused on Europe. The scope is wider on the asset management side. We have nothing serious, except the Cattolica investment, which is a strategic and industrial investment. On Borsa Italiana, there is absolutely nothing. We are not involved in this. So basically, this is it.",

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So I'll start quickly with the P&C frequency before moving to the first one. So on the frequencies, yes, we've seen dramatic decreases of frequency during the lockdown, especially on motors by more than 50%. But we've also seen decreases in some other lines of business. What is interesting is that even if frequencies have increased after the significant increase after the lockdown, they've not come back yet to normal levels, which I think is a good indicator also of the economic recovery. So we still have frequencies which are down compared to our normal levels.",
            "On the first question on Switzerland. So first, this is important to understand where it comes from. So it comes from an acceleration of the reserve strengthening which relates to an old unit-linked portfolio in runoff, which was close to new business around 10 years ago. The size of this portfolio is around CHF8 billion, and this portfolio has financial guarantees. The average guarantee on the book is at around 2.3% and these are at maturity guarantees. So the book is partially hedged for interest rate and equity market moves. But as you may have seen, the interest rates have decreased a lot recently in all countries and also in Switzerland. And due to this extremely low level and due to the fact that we want to have a prudent reserving approach, we've decided to accelerate what we had started to do about 10 years ago. So about 10 years ago, in accordance with the Swiss regulators, we had decided to set up a guarantee reserve linked to this portfolio. At the end of 2019, this reserve had reached an amount of CHF1.3 billion. And again, linked to the context, we decided to accelerate this reserving in the -- in 2020. So we've booked CHF300 million in the first half, and we will book to the same amount in the second half. After that, we will come back, I would say, to normal levels of reserving.",
            "So I understand your questions on why don't we do it one-off as it is linked to, first, this is linked to the way the Swiss regulator -- the agreement with the Swiss regulator and how the Swiss regulator decides that we should book this. And then you should have in mind that this is a very long-term portfolio, about 30 years maturities, and the agreement with the regulator is that we will continue to increase reserves over the next seven years. But again, at -- we will come back to a normal pace of reserving.",
            "In addition, you may have seen that, again, with the same philosophy to be cautious. We decided to impair the goodwill on our Swiss portfolio and on our Swiss operation, and it had a \u20ac93 million impact at half year. I think -- and I will conclude with this. I think it is important to understand that the Swiss portfolio against this run-off portfolio has very high technical profits and very high fees. So of course, we have a negative investment margins but we have partially compensating fees, very high technical margins and very high fees. So what I can tell you is that at current market conditions, we estimate that the value of the portfolio is negative in the region of mid-triple-digit hundreds million euro. I hope I was clear, Andrew."

Would you be able to comment how much of that you think is structural and how much of it is simply a sort of short-term volume and mix effect that might reverse in due course? Second question, I noticed your Italian motor premiums were down 7%. I was wondering if you could just outline the drivers of that and maybe put it in the context of what you see has happened to the whole market as well. And then yes, finally, maybe just to come back quickly on Switzerland. I was just wondering if you could out -- I mean, obviously, you mentioned the lower interest rates, which are, I guess, the primary driver. But I'm just wondering if you could just highlight sort of what the further risks are for that. And whether -- sorry, just to clarify, whether from 2022, you do expect to be back on the sort of the old run rate for operating profit going forward?"

            "So Peter, so on expense ratio, you are right that there's a strong decrease of expenses this year, which is linked to, I would say, of course, directly to the COVID impact, which is also linked to additional discipline. Again, in tough times, we have additional discipline. So it's difficult to say what is run rate and what is one-off. As a high level order of magnitude, I would say, probably around 50-50. But what is important is that all of this made us aware that we have other margins to decrease expenses, and we will continue to decrease expenses even next year beyond what we had in mind in our plan. So we've -- we are working on this. And again, this is linked to the experience of the past few months.",
            "On the motor premium development, I understand that your question was linked to Italy only. So yes, there was a quite significant decrease of premiums -- of motor premiums in Italy. Part of this is linked to a postponement of renewals. So we will see that and we will see by end of September, we will see a recovery over the coming months. Still, I expect the premium evolution figure on motor to remain negative. And this is linked to both a more difficult new business and both -- and to the fact that in the current circumstances, we support our clients. And as frequencies have decreased a lot, our clients are also benefiting from this, and we see a decrease on the average premium.",

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So I just wanted to sort of understand the risks to the guidance that you've given. I mean I'm assuming a further fall in interest rates would mean that maybe you have to take a sort of slightly bigger short-term hit, and just sort of confirm or understand that as you see it at the moment, as it currently stands, that from 2022, we should be back to a sort of normal operating level that we've seen in the past."

         "Remarks": [
            "So, it is clear that this Swiss portfolio is sensitive to the Swiss interest rate level. We've adopted for the -- for 2020, a cautious approach. But if we had a significant increase of, again, of Swiss interest rates, it would have a negative impact. Again, based on the -- based on today's scenario, as I've said before, we expect that after the strong effort that we've made this year, we will come back to normal level of reserving in Switzerland. We will continue to allocate to the guarantee reserve as we've done over the past years."

            "Just some fairly quick questions, I think. In the life business, I noticed it was only really Switzerland and Spain, I think, where you had the declines in net investment margin. There was a lot of resilience in Italy, Germany, France, in particular. Do we expect more pressure there in second half or going forward, I mean, particularly because you've already flagged we're going to see lower real estate rents? Obviously, lower dividends must have already come through, I suppose. But maybe just clarify, is that resilience in the investment spread in those countries not to be extrapolated? Or is it? Linked to that, maybe just update us broadly on what you're doing with your sort of reinvestment strategy in current markets. I've seen that you've obviously flagged very low reinvestment rates. I don't know what you can do to supplement those. Maybe just give us an overview as to how you're treating the problem of reinvestment right now, which has clearly got even more challenging.",
            "And the final question, I should probably know the answer to this. This is a very quick one. I'm a bit confused. Asset management result was up a lot quarterly, as in Q2 versus Q1, even though average AUM must have been down, at least for external clients. But is there some seasonality in the asset management result? And I think there is, but just remind us why that is."

If I have to compare what is the expected net of extraordinary development of the market, which is still unknown in front of us, should be quite fairly similar to the first half of the 2020 due to the actions and due to also the equilibrium in the investment part, we managed through this quite low-yield environment."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Andrew, this is Tim Ryan, the Group CIO. So on your second question on reinvestment strategy, the first point I want to mention is we are very cautious on the way we deployed capital. You will have seen that even our cash position has increased. Why? Because we always want to look at the risk-adjusted return. And what do we do to do this? We have done a couple of key elements. One is to continue to selectively invest in investment-grade with high-quality names, and this has been very efficient. Our team has done a wonderful job on this first point. The second is to continue, as we said before because our strategy is to be resilient whatever the market situation is in real assets. And on real assets, we have seen some quite big dislocation, both on the private equity side as well as on the private debt side. And this is all across the different geographies. And for us, this is for an opportunity to even accelerate the deployment. But again, being very cautious on risk and liquidity, which is a key element. So this is to answer your second question.",
            "The third element, I will answer as well on the asset management side. We have said that our projection to deliver \u20ac350 million by 2021 would be quite linear, but there is some seasonality that comes from the second point I mentioned just on your question is that we deploy on the real asset. We do have commitments. We do have fees that are captured at different point of time. There is a seasonality. That is usually the second quarter as well as the last quarter of the year, we have a bit of a pickup on the fees. So this is to understand this. But at the end, why we've been resisting fairly well is that asset mix, that is not just third party, but the asset mix we have is today, a majority of fixed income products. And obviously, with the yield compression on government bond, this has been helped -- enabled us to also benefit from a bit of a market uptick on the -- on our fixed income portfolio, which, therefore, gets more fees."

But with regards to the \u20ac87 million in nonlife, could you give us the breakdown of that between the gross items? Because presumably, you've taken travel losses which are a negative, but then you have the benefit of frequency that we've already talked about. And I'm not sure what the two opposing numbers are getting to \u20ac87 million. So that's question one, if you could tell us the loss versus the frequency gains. Secondly, could you update us please on where the average guarantee has got to in your life and force portfolio? I'm sorry if I'm out of date. But I think the last time you published, it was at last year's may Investor Day when you talked about 1.2% in 2018. I'm sorry if I missed it at the end of last year. But could you just give us an update on where that average guarantee has got to? Presumably, it's not changed much. I'm just assuming it may be down a little bit, and I would like to check.",

And if the banks are anything to go and buy it's still quite a challenge. So I appreciate that you guys, in terms of your numbers seem to be screening fine against your own assessment of risk.

            "Yes. So the \u20ac87 million, clearly, this is an estimation and has been done accordingly to a methodology compared to our budget expected point, which is a fair point to be clarified in explaining you how we did it. But basically, the \u20ac87 million net benefit comprises around \u20ac70 million direct claims, both travel and business interruption. And then we have a figure of lower volumes, which is having a negative impact of the order of \u20ac100 million. And then this goes on the positive side with the lower claims frequency due to the reduced activity in -- particularly in motor. So the net effect of this is bringing a positive \u20ac180 million between negative volumes part and positive effect on technical profitability.",
            "And then, you have another delta between this \u20ac180 million and to get to the \u20ac87 million, which is a combination of lower income from regular income, especially dividends -- less dividends in the first half of the year concentrated and having a higher impact on a pro rata basis because it's on half year and not on the full year but -- and then other operating costs coming from COVID-related initiatives, which are not included in the technical results, but are mainly related to the support of the business given for the operational functioning during this very complex moment. Second point related to this is that we are in between 1.25% to 1.3%, in that range, in the middle of that range, that should be the expected average range -- rate guarantee you have on our life book. And this will proceed in this way according to the transformation of the lower guarantees coming from the new business that we underwrite, which are done also in some cases at negative guarantees.",
            "Don't forget -- don't focus only on the average guarantee of the book. Take, for example, into account, that 27% of the saving business and done in Italy in the first half has been done with the only debt benefit guarantee, and not a financial guarantee related to that, which is bringing further down the strain on the capital consumption of the saving business. We will clearly update you with the detailed figure for the year-end figures."

And I'm really sorry, I didn't follow the -- precisely the answer you gave to Will on the on the claims and the impact in nonlife because I came up with a negative figure in total, and clearly, it's a positive \u20ac87 million. So I just wondered if you could help me on that. And then, you talked about the cash position and can you update a little bit on what it is? And what the cash flow you see for the whole of the year, given your target of the mid-teen, I think, over \u20ac7 billion over three years. And then the last point, I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about Cattolica. I noticed you mentioned it as both a financial and a strategic investment. And I just wondered if you could kind of give on industrial investment, give a kind of feeling where exactly it lies. Is it part of your budget of around \u20ac4 billion of deals?

I just gave you a further information, which is within the positive result of claim. We had an impact of \u20ac70 million from travel and business interruption. So that -- you have a view of what was the impact. But at the end of the story, we had a positive impact in technical profitability for \u20ac275 million and then a negative impact for volumes of \u20ac100 million, which is netting out to get the \u20ac180 million coming for the combination of premium and profitability overall. And this is the \u20ac180 million. From \u20ac180 million, \u20ac87 million, you need to deduct lower income for dividend, which we did not receive from equity participation in the first half, which is even more impacting pro rata. And second, some initiatives, which are not accounted in the technical results. So you don't see them in the combined ratio final figure but are there to support the functioning of these complex moments of specific COVID environment to give to the network and the operational and the agents and all the distributors the support needed in order to function and produce at the end of the story, what, in my personal opinion, is a very good result in -- even nonlife collection, as you have seen.",

I recall you that we paid in May the first tranche of the dividend and notwithstanding that last time we talked, I told you that we had more than \u20ac4.1 billion. I can confirm you that we have a very healthy level about that one-off cash, which allows us to fulfill cash and capital flexibility in such an important and uncertain moment, which is one of our key assets, in my opinion, reaching and reducing a lot of uncertainty coming from the future.

And the meeting of the shareholders of Cattolica will decide tomorrow if they accept, if they approve the transformation and the capital increase proposed by the Board of Directors of Cattolica. So at this stage, I would say, it's still potential. If we make the investment, it will be something around \u20ac350 million for having 24.4% of the company. And it goes, obviously, together with an industrial partnership on asset management, on reinsurance, on health insurance, and on Internet of Things.

            "On claims frequency, what are the benefits on the claims frequency? So first, you have to know that we've closed our accounts and especially on the claims side, we've closed these accounts in a cautious way, I would say, which means even more cautious than we were used to do in the past. Why have we done so? Because there are a lot of uncertainties over the coming months, and we thought that it was a good policy to be extremely cautious in closing our accounts and in closing our claims. So you do not -- you see part of the benefits of the claims frequency in the half year accounts. You do not see all of it, and we will see what happens in the coming months. There were scenarios, I mean, we had been looking at China and at the increased traffic in China after the lockdown. So we were thinking that frequencies may increase after the lockdown. Now we are monitoring this extremely carefully. And as I said before, in July, frequencies have not come back yet to have not fully come back to normal levels. So again, your question is absolutely valid. You see -- but it's complex to answer. So you see part of the benefits in our combined ratio in the first half. You do not see everything because we've been cautious, and we are anticipating or we are -- we want to anticipate potentially what happens in the coming months. But again, if you ask me in the second half, how frequencies will be, I cannot tell you yet. I can just tell you that in July, frequencies are still improving compared to last year.",
            "On the life side, so in fact, volumes are -- have been doing well in the first six months. And there is a combination of various factors. First, people and it may seem paradox, but people have saved more in the -- globally in the first half, which is good for our business. The second factor is that our agent channel has been extremely performing over the lockdown period, and that was something we had never experienced. So we were not sure of what to expect. And the combination from agents and digital tool has proved to be an extremely strong weapon, if I may say. So our agents have continued to advise our clients. Our agents have continued to sell. And we are extremely happy with the performance of our agent channels around the globe. Then there is a third interesting factor on the life volumes is that mix has -- and I have already discussed this at the end of the Q1, mix have significantly improved. So you see that protection has continued to improve -- to increase. You see that unit-linked have dramatically improved. But even if you exclude this specific pension contract in Italy, unit-linked have slightly improved over the first six months, and Generali new business has decreased. And I would say that this is extremely interesting because this is different from previous crisis that we had experienced in which clients were selling their unit-linked products to invest in guaranteed products. And we've not seen this at all, and we're happy to see that the mix has continued to improve.",
            "What will happen next? It's difficult for me to say. We've made a big survey in about 20 countries where we are active. Clients tell us that they want to be more protected and that they want to invest more in life insurance products. This is what they tell us, which is a good signal. Will it happen? I cannot tell you yet. But let's say that the -- we are quite positive based on this survey and what clients tell us. But again, this is an uncertainty."

Clearly -- okay, apart from the lower nat cat burden of 0.3 percentage points, what you see is that the positive contribution for prior year's development decreased to 2.5% compared to 4.1% of last year. But this drop has very well underlined by -- highlighted by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, does not reflect the change in the strength of the reserving position. This is rather contingent on prudency and the liquidation of the claims in the process of the current COVID-19 environment.

The normalized capital generation was strong in the first half at \u20ac1.9 billion due to the booth from P&C as we looking forward to potential recessionary scenarios where the P&C results might be more normalized and the life contribution may be impacted by continued lower investment income and lower new business value, do you remain confident that Generali can deliver on the normalized capital generation target of \u20ac10.5 billion over the 2021 plan? That's the first question. The second question is just relating to the reserving action and the ongoing profitability drive for the Swiss life business. I suppose as the action today and over the first half, alter your view on the strategic position of that business and the Swiss business within the Generali Group. Given that it's unlikely to generate profitable growth or generate a high-return on capital deployed, which are core metrics within the Generali 2021 plan.",

            "Absolutely. So Colm, a fair point to say that there is a kind of support as of today in the P&C capital generation. But what I would like to stress is you need to take into account different factors. Going forward, our product mix as well highlighted by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was giving even more in the capital-light space. And even in the saving world, as I was telling you, for example, in Italy, 27% of the saving has been done without a financial guarantee only with a death benefit in case of that you guarantee the amount of premium, nothing else, which is a very healthy capacity to generate a new business margin. We are continuously focusing in growing the ancillary guarantees and protection part in this business and the unit-linked collection, which allows us to be confident to get to the capital generation level, knowing the fact that we are doing well in growth also for the P&C part with a very healthy growth on the non-motor component. Having said that, so we are not in this environment under pressure for the \u20ac10.5 billion. We will see the evolution going forward, but we were very well dynamically acting against this. And our new products are showing this form of resilience, I think you have seen from our new business margin.",
            "Third point related to sensitivity on BTP. Are they changed from the final year? Let me say that, no, because if I look as of also these days, we are at level of spread which are not far even slightly better than the year-end, and in a level of not activation of the so-called country-specific VA. So we need really an opening of BTP spread, let's say, as of the half year condition, end of June, okay, because that was the last moment we calculated. The trigger would have been with flat corporate spray that as of end of June, we would have need something in the order of 50 to 60 bps of further opening of BTP spread before triggering the country-specific volatility adjustment. So no big changes, in my opinion, to the sensitivity reported. Hope I gave you more insights [ph]."

We have, like any business that is related to life, a very conservative approach that is to rely on fixed income and also to deploy within the real asset, especially on real estate. So the answer is that we have room to take risk. We are obviously very careful about the adjustment that you need to do to back some of the guarantees. So we are using the -- both the government for the typical duration matching as well as corporate bond spreads, which we look at hedging back into Swiss franc. And on the margins, you have a pickup around the real estate and investing in a very prudent way in the debt mortgages as well in Switzerland, which is a very high-margin business for us."

Of course, it depends very much on your interest rate assumption. Just as a reminder, we'll have -- in 2023, we'll have IFRS 17. So at this point, this would be -- everything will be really mark-to-market. I cannot say much more. This is, again, the -- as I've said, we have this negative investment margin, very interest-rate dependent.

Or is it a bit of a catch-up from past as well? I mean what I'm trying to understand is like how should we think about future reserving additions, et cetera, if interest rates don't change. So I mean if it is, let's say, the \u20ac600 million is just because of this recent drop in interest rate and then more or less, I don't think you would need to worry in the future too much, but if there is a bit of catch-up from past as well as then probably interest rate plays a bit of a role here because interest rates have been declining for past, let's say, 10 years."

So it's a temporary drop, let's say, due to the execution of the plan. Nothing more specifically missed apart from the \u20ac100 million COVID expenses on an international fund.
