         "Ladies and gentlemen, good evening and good morning to you all. Thank you for joining Puxin Limited second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Together, the teaching staff and students have overcome the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic over the past few months. Under the guidance of the Ministry of Education and the National Health Commission, local governments have coordinated with schools and universities to resume classes and we are glad to see the entire education industry is finally back on track. Again, we appreciate the contribution of government departments, all sectors of the community as well as the staff at Puxin. Thank you for providing your continued social, mental and educational support.",
         "In the second quarter of 2020, though there were a few bounce back occurrences of COVID-19 in some areas of China, Puxin continued to place the mental and physical health of our students and teaching staff to our first priority. We have had zero COVID-19 case and we will work our best to keep this record going forward. Puxin has made steady progress in the second quarter. Student enrollments increased by 18.1% year-over-year to 857,000. Puxin once again won the recognition of students and parents with our excellent teaching quality.",

         "The COVID-19 pandemic gave us a unique opportunity to reflect on our business. In terms of Puxin\u2019s organic growth plus M&A dual-engine strategy, we found Puxin business systems effective for improving to operational and financial performance of the acquired schools. Positive achievements can be seen in carryover income, non-GAAP income and student enrollments. These have proved that the acquisition and integration approach is truly driving the organic internal growth of Puxin. For example, the non-GAAP income of the majority of K-12 schools acquired in 2015 and 2016 became positive after adopting Puxin business system. These results have reaffirmed the strategic role of PBS and its capability to optimize capital structure. Overall, the education industry has recovered substantially since the second quarter of this year. However, we will never slacken our efforts.",
         "Looking into the third quarter of 2020, we will continue our focus on the K-12 business segment and the Online-Merge-Offline strategy.

And my second question is, so, could you please provide some updates on the implementation of our OMO strategy and also some color on our M&A plans for the second half? Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, thank you for question. For the first question of the reopening of offline learning centers, we are happy to say over 90% of current offline learning centers have been reopened step by step though as we have to get the permission from the local educational committees and those are pandemic fighting authorities. Unfortunately, we have two major cities, which are still under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which are Beijing and Dalian. As you may have known Dalian, we have 2 K-12 parlors operating there which makes Dalian the largest single city of our K-12 operation for Puxin. Due to the outbreak of the pandemic in the \u2013 by the end of June, the offline learning centers, Dalian, have been closed and all the program classes have to be transferred to online. So, yes, we did have some negative impact due to the second round of outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in Beijing and Dalian. For Dalian, the impact is mainly on the shoulder of K-12 business. And in Beijing, the burden is mainly on the study-abroad business. So, yes, we did have some negative impact, especially in Beijing and Dalian, but we are still optimistic about the rebounding of the business in all of our offline learning centers. As to the OMO strategy, we have been implementing the \u2013 our OMO strategy during the pandemic period. We had several pilot programs in our Tier 2 cities like Taiwan, like Chengdu, which are quite optimistic for the first pilot programs. But in terms of revenues, it only contributes a very small part of the revenue. So, OMO strategy is one of the priorities of our business, but it still needs time to play significant part of our business. And as to the third question about this, the M&A, we did not make any acquisition during the first half of this year also due to the outbreak of the COVID-19, but we have been working hard to get back on track with our MS strategy. Again, we will speak to our acquisition and integration strategy. With the outbreak of the COVID-19, we can say more targets are available due to the pandemic and we will work hard to get back on track. Thank you."
