            "Great. So, I just want to like to start here is just, you\u2019ve been in the role about two years and a little over two years, I think, and could you just walk us through sort of what you set out to accomplish as you joined and it\u2019s been a lot of changes at the company, a lot of them strategic in terms of markets you\u2019re focused on and so forth. Could you help us understand sort of where you are along that process of transformation of the company, and then more importantly, kind of how we think about things going forward, now that that\u2019s -- now that we\u2019re two years in?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks, Walter, and thanks for having me here. As we talked about two years ago, I remember. I was new to cybersecurity. I didn\u2019t understand the cybersecurity space and there is like my first all enterprise as late after Google, that is somehow surprising.",
            "I spend a lot of time talking to customers, talking to you guys, talking to -- lots of us has chatted to the space and studying the cybersecurity industry. I realized we had a really good firewall business, phenomenal one, still strong, naturally it\u2019s a firewall, as well as bunch of security subscriptions.",
            "But we have risen in a bunch of other categories, which I think was right categories, because company is early thinking about cloud security, thinking about remote access, and thinking about some element of a data oriented, AI oriented security strategy. But we didn\u2019t have enough have to build, so we had a good catch as you can around the ability of that.",
            "So the last two years we\u2019ve spent a lot of time and effort building a cloud security platform, building a data analytics based approach towards security around Cortex and I think goes through a combination of organic and inorganic capability is shown that we\u2019ve actually been able to build platforms and become kind of industry best of breed, if you will, in multiple categories.",
            "We were in Magic Quadrant far right corner in firewalls. Today, we think we could be in five different such quarters between Prisma Cloud, Prisma Access, Cortex XDR, Cortex XSOAR and firewall.",
            "So in two years, when we get there, let me walk on and so there is two other talks about one part of it getting the products right and getting to be more of a cybersecurity partner of choice as opposed to a firewall vendor, which is like having saw 100 CIOs and see someone said, thank you for coming, really appreciate or seeing you because you\u2019re CIO in space.",
            "But honestly, I never security to advice firewalls, maybe my firewall is more than 10 years, it did all the features whatever you file. So this is not going to be long-term relation. Today, when we talk about cloud security, digital transformation, moving you to away from MPLS and SD-WAN to more security now that we have exposure. So I think we climb the some of the -- or we bought [inaudible] of being a multi-product company with three platforms and be a cybersecurity coverage.",
            "The second aspect of that would be, again, we build products and hence we will sell them with a sales force across all these categories. And I think our most recent quarter, has clearly we have shown that we can take something and go out and build those $2 billion or buildings of new category, but we are going ourselves the investors and people who that I have lived many of the companies have tried in the past, many cybersecurity stalwarts have tried it and it\u2019s a hard task to get done. You cannot rotate a very strong one product company and actually build a meaningful revenue stream or a billion stream in a separate category.",
            "And I feel much more comfortable now after this past one year that we can do it. And we found some model between our core sales team and the teams that are selling this. There\u2019s a lot of work to be done in terms of streamlines and these things streamline some of the stuff, product categories and product capabilities, but I feel a lot better today than I did almost two years ago, maybe one year."

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And how do we think about the sort of transformational or strategic moves that still need to come at a high level. What would you tell us to sort of think about from that perspective?"

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Look, I mean, I think, if you\u2019re an investor of Palo Alto or a prospective investor of Palo Alto, the biggest challenges two years ago, can this guy, I think, can you go build an enterprise company and take it forward? Can you actually build a multi-product business in cybersecurity?",
            "So hopefully, we\u2019ve proven that with me and the team that we can actually, I mean, we are different from other people with pride. And hopefully we have some trust from our investors that, we showed a slide in the quarter presentation where we\u2019ve taken 4x the business environment from everyone\u2019s acquired company.",
            "So we have shown that when we go make acquisitions, we actually understand the market, we pick the right players, we pick the winners and we actually able to then in short order we integrate them and amplifies our business plan. That\u2019s hard to do in an 18-month timeframe as part of the business plans. But we have been able to do that across a myriad of companies that required. So I am not still -- not there yet. We still have integrated cloud industries acquired within four months ago.",
            "So we acquire them, we integrate them in six months to nine months to 12 months outside. We build on the market capability around them and we go and convince customers that this is the right product to get of Palo Alto. So we should have that credibility.",
            "If you look at historically, M&A has always been a part of an enterprise company\u2019s scale strategy, really look at Cisco, Salesforce, SAP, look at the large $100 billion, $200 billion enterprise companies. There\u2019s always an element of acquiring product into the company and lining it up with the go-to-market salesforce.",
            "Now we\u2019re very careful. We don\u2019t buy customers because they cost a lot more money in terms of multiples rather we brought customers who have the customers. I buy product which is bleeding edge, best of breed, that allows you to get on trade as a customer, allows you to stick the entire portfolio for other products and sell that or allows my existing customers to get more capability and integrate with all of us."

         "Remarks": [
            "Great. Maybe we could turn to talk a little bit about how sort of COVID is coming as a wrinkle here. You\u2019ve made, I think, a number of comments on the last couple of conference calls and so, mainly looking forward, how you think about, how this landscape plays out both what impact it\u2019s had on the threat landscape, as well as how customers are interacting with vendors such as yourself?"

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. So I think, Walter, net-net, COVID is a huge positive for technology and a positive for cybersecurity. If you look across the world, the only thing that\u2019s working is that as an e-commerce capability or some form of technology that is enabling your life, whether it\u2019s your groceries or your food delivery or whatever you have, it\u2019s the enablement is being created by them, volumes are going up on all time social media center.",
            "So you see networking, more you enable your business with technology, more security you need. So I think it\u2019s a net positive for us. And it\u2019s a net positive that customers are on the margin more risk averse than they were six months ago.",
            "So they\u2019re trying to consolidate towards larger players and they want consolidation, they want simplicity in their IT stack, their security stack, that\u2019s a good positive to us, us having more topical products today as people are moving to the cloud or starting cloud security with [inaudible] in terms of our security deals in the market against anyone.",
            "So that\u2019s useful for us, us having competitor to XP or CrowdStrike is topical, because people are turning off Symantec and McAfee and trying to new solution. So we believe we have the right products and that\u2019s helping. So COVID actually is a net-net positive.",
            "The only cautiousness I have around COVID in fact is in enterprise sales like it was six months long. So we\u2019re still not six months into COVID and a lot of the performance could be a lot of work that have been done prior to COVID, there is a lot of more good thing happened during COVID.",
            "The question is COVID also in the 12 more months, there has to be some pain that is going on from the economy perspective for many of our customers and we will get a dozen back, because that\u2019s -- it is a lot of positives, there\u2019s a bit of negative and the uncertainty associated on how long COVID last it give me a reason for us to be cautious. You can tell me COVID has gone tomorrow, but last six months from now, we can all be more bullish about our expectations."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And you mentioned there displacement of some of the players in the market. To what extent are you seeing customers willing to accelerate those displacement type decisions versus customers sort of stepping back and saying I don\u2019t have the money or I don\u2019t have the sort of wherewithal right now to do big projects where I might involve displacing a big vendor?"

         "Speaker": "Walter Pritchard"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I think, generally, people are most focused on what needs to get done in their tech stack. So move to the cloud or accelerated. Remember SD-WAN and Prisma Access is a cost savings to the customer to get off of MPLS to save 40% that\u2019s always a useful project you can done, if you can help you reduce my costs like 40%, while we have take that for something else, because everybody\u2019s watching MPLS carefully.",
            "So cost driven projects are still attracted to our customer basis. They are getting stuff done. Surprisingly, during COVID, more cust -- the customers was not traveling, they\u2019re still start focus and getting stuff done, and actually getting more stuff done. In COVID times, they were getting before COVID. Having to us I think they are available.",
            "So I don\u2019t think the activity is down. I think on the margin, yes, of course, they\u2019re being cautious about big projects that they undertake and software projects are more preferable than hardware projects, because hardware requires taking physical delivery, go into data center and deploying firewall software, I can turn those my access on globally for your entire user base without actually having to go touch each box that I\u2019m shipping. So there are some micro trends underneath this, which are also helpful the industry."

         "Remarks": [
            "Makes sense. I want to go back to the sort of transformation that you\u2019ve talked about at the company and I think one area we haven\u2019t hit on is on the go-to-market side and so you brought up in a new gentleman as President. I think in the first year that you were CEO, there\u2019s lots of focus about all the changes that happen within sales. Can you talk about sort of where we are today with the salesforce and especially how depth you think they are at selling this product portfolio, which has changed or evolved pretty substantially over the last couple years?"

         "Speaker": "Walter Pritchard"
      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Overall, I will point, nothing tells the story go to the numbers, right? We did 1.4 billion in billings, largest quarter companies ever done in the midst of COVID. We did $928 million of billings in next-generation security, surpassing our estimates of $815 million, which we thought was going to happen as recently as four months ago.",
            "So I\u2019m very excited about the execution that the company that the sales teams have been able to pull off especially in this environment. So I think we found the balance between all the people we brought in and all the changes we made that people are fired up and I was saying this to one of your investors earlier, that is a big change has been the quality of our products has gone up drastically or wonderfully in the NGS category that our salespeople are excited about. We\u2019ve talked about the customer where the four or five quarters ago we sold them 10 plus firewall and for that quarter we sold 10 plus firewall Prisma before that was sold 10 plus Cortex.",
            "Now, that wouldn\u2019t happen if we didn\u2019t have Prisma on Cortex. It\u2019s happen by the same sales team that sold firewall. So we can see that their previous capacity capability of just being able to go to the customer base and expand your portfolio. That is the long-term scalability with the enterprise. If you have customer relationships, can you bring capable products that integrate with your products and drop them to the same customers and get them better?",
            "If you can, that\u2019s a win, because its way harder acquiring a net new customer or selling into an existing happy customer, just purely economically. So we have the field force. We have the relationship. Our NPS scores are higher, customer success scores, CATS scores are high, low cost. So I think it\u2019s the right setup for us to be able to bring great product. We think we have to bring new product. Because your reputation of the stack or the quality of product if you are going to acquire customers."

            "Got it. And I wanted before continuing, I just want to drive raise attention to on the panel on the left of the conference session, there is a spot to put in questions if anybody wants to submit questions here to the discussion and I\u2019ll get those through email. So on that point around sales, I agree you\u2019ve done especially in the last, two, three quarters, that\u2019s really come through. I think you\u2019re at -- you extended your fiscal year. I think in the past you had made some moves like put in place these speed bumps, for example, that helped to drive some traction on some of the newer products. Are there any major moves that you\u2019ve made on the sales and marketing side that you\u2019d highlight going into fiscal \u201821 here or is it sort of more at the point where things are evolving from the strategies you put in place over the last couple years?"

      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "That\u2019s a great question, Walter. I think you may have seen that the last two quarters, we stuck in the snuck in the ARR metric for NGS service. Because I think if you step back, you look at it, we have a lot more comfort now that we believe you have the product portfolio, we can sell the new product portfolio, we can do it in an efficient optimized manner without Cortex. So now the question is what\u2019s next, question next, let\u2019s go create more scalability, and more scalability means, let\u2019s go drive more NGS, more NGS whether it\u2019s for our business and I will talk about this separate if you asked me about the margin profile evolution of ex-U.S. But we are talking about America.",
            "So the question, okay, what do you need to be continually successful is next thing you need to continue to be successful in business, make sure that all of our national security products are being deployed and consumed more like SaaS billing. So there\u2019s a lot of focus this year in making sure that as we sold a lot of NGN, let\u2019s make sure it gets deployed. Let\u2019s make sure it gets consumed because that consumption allows our an article that goes for the future [inaudible] for this product and they are still lack their term because these things are two-year to three-year terms. So we had here year and a half to make sure our customers who brought all these products are really happy.",
            "It is a very important motion for us, because in firewalls kind of shift the firewall, the customer does one on the firewall six more years. So there\u2019s a little bit of and there\u2019s six months deployment, in our previous product very small deployment. So a lot of focus on the sales team to sell the customers, make sure to deploy and that\u2019s a hygiene for us that we have to make sure that we do, but there is no major shift in our incentive program that actually that were done last year."

      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. Got it. And then, I guess, on that side, you mentioned ARR is this you\u2019re conditioning your salespeople more to sell along in lines of ARR and to drive upsell, not necessarily land with large deals. Can you just comment on sort of where you\u2019re focusing salespeople from a kind of metric incentive perspective?"

      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Larger sales folk -- the salespeople continue to be focused on these metrics because that\u2019s what our model has that [inaudible]. That\u2019s what allows us to keep our duration strong and keep our cash flow margins right. There are one or two categories like Prisma Cloud, which lend themselves to a more a shorter piece of year or shorter contract duration and that\u2019s about two years compared it has about three years. That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s we have.",
            "The focus actually is to make sure that once they sold some industrial machines, they deployed the SAP and if they want to deploy they position, because our Prisma Cloud model slightly different because it\u2019s -- we keep adding more modules and we drive more consumption volume. So that\u2019s the only vision to more product category compared to it."

         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. That makes sense. And then, I guess, relative to this transition you\u2019ve had going on in the business. Can you talk about, a lot of these new products are in new categories? How much of it cannibalizes budget that you might have seen on the firewall side? Is there any direct cannibalization of firewall sales? What have you seen manifests itself in terms of conversations with customers as you\u2019re trying to get budget share?"

      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I prefer using the word sort of replacement or transition of cannibalization, because in a firewall capacity is needed, if you stop doing your data centers, AWS or CCP either you still need firewall inside it. So in that case, it cannibalizes a hardware sale, but it compensates software. So do I need a firewall to make sure Walter can dial in from his home? Yes, of course, he do back in the data center. If I choose not to do it in the data center, I put SD-WAN and I put Prisma Access on Walter\u2019s laptop and now I can go make that happen from a smaller office or from remote premise. So that becomes a software swap.",
            "So, yes, you do see, you\u2019re seeing constant swaps between hardware and software form factors. But I\u2019m not seeing cannibalization of this space. I\u2019m actually thinking long-term is net positive because you see more consumption of cloud, you see more tech enablement of our customer, you see more people deploying more and more remote solution. So I think this is a net positive to overall strength and you\u2019ve seen in that numbers."

      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. And then as it relates to these -- the -- there\u2019s a number of next generation security categories that you\u2019re in, which of those do you think you\u2019re in the strongest competitive position? And then which of these categories do you think you\u2019d have more work to do either with the product or with your own sales teams or otherwise to be in a competitive position that you\u2019d like to be in?"

      "18": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Look, I think, Prisma Cloud is extremely strong, because we have 1,800 customers from scratch from two years ago and we sell in two customers who have typically deploying SAP, AWS Azure. So we\u2019re dealing with the native cloud provider, as well as ourselves going on top of that and selling cloud security that takes that that\u2019s really good. We see no competitive sort of -- no, we don\u2019t see a clear competitor who can do as many things we can do, we\u2019ll see a slimmer competitor once in a while with some of those customers and we are trying, we think the words are [inaudible].",
            "So very excited about that and the way to track that with the number of customers in the wireless space, we believe over time it\u2019s into consumption for every customer grows. Really excited about Prisma Access, we declare a number of $90 million Prisma Access to CloudGenix this quarter, that compares to Zscaler, which I think it has 30 one or two quarters ago or something. So, we\u2019re showing you that, look, when we put our hearts and minds toward building a better product category, we actually can get to some sort of scale and start looking at what somebody else is doing.",
            "I am excited about XDR, it was even great products, only six months in. We set two more and being able to be more competitive situations against abstract, but the key focus is to be in more -- be in more deals. XDR is a current space with Silacks [ph], Carbon Black and one of us comes back, but two years ago if you ask, I was following to a contender in what pressure we were not two years in, we were in the four or five vendors in XDR. We were the first XDR launched in the world, so we actually defined what XDR for us.",
            "So I am really excited about it. It\u2019s still early days, of course, need to more work and execution on that front side of Prisma Access, side about Prisma Cloud and I am very excited about the IT security capabilities in the good firewall with the change there, it\u2019s a bit of easy add to our firewall state of thousands of customers we deploy firewalls."

            "That\u2019s what we see over there. There is delivered to betters. We will look at their security or workload security or sell it or [inaudible], but there\u2019s nobody who does the seven modules that we have.",
            "On Cortex, in XDR, as I said, we see CrowdStrike, since I\u2019ll ask coming back talking about those guys, but it\u2019s 30 days to 1,000 customers in two quarters, which is great. Part of it is conversion part with the existing reps, customers part of net new customers. But we have one deals against all of them. So we feel comfortable that our competitive product in this space. My turn give it the best ranking a few months ago in that category.",
            "So on Prisma Access, it\u2019s pretty much say hardware solve. So people will just buy more 400 firewalls in the data centers to get more and more capacities. And typically, competitively, we\u2019ll end up against Zscaler."

And then going back to the appliance business, I think, when you gave the guidance for the upcoming year, you talked about flat to slightly up product, which I think there\u2019s been higher expectations in the past, that number seems pretty achievable just based on it being kind of flattish. But how conservative is that? Obviously, you had some challenges a year ago on that business. And just trying to get a sense as to we have a tougher macro, so it would make sense that number is lower. But it does seem pretty low. Just wanted to understand sort of what you\u2019ve built into that forecasting scenario around flat to slightly up?"

I know the product part gets called out shortly in the P&L because it has a revenue profile that is different from ratable revenue profile, and it impacts the EPS and margins for the year.",
            "But we had a customer call. Customer call and said, I\u2019d like to increase my capacity for remote secure work. I had a choice as well in firewalls and deploy them in 50 locations, taking two months to four months or I had a choice of giving them Prisma Access with cloud-based firewall, I gave them Prisma Access, right?",
            "I\u2019d rather us in software because software is easy to upgrade, total cost of ownership is lower. I mean, if I sell you hardware box, you have to talk on it every year, but I have launching new software release. And that\u2019s on you and people get nervous deploying software and spend, it spend on your rating.",
            "It\u2019s a lot easy if I keep upgrading a software every month in the cloud, they don\u2019t have to get bulk those front end [ph]. So the software solve is a much more elegant solve, better security, low-cost of ownership in the long-term. So I think we went through a transition to the industry. Some people don\u2019t have the software capability on their side, they some will have ran to their customers. And some people like us who have software capability to others all software capability to our customers.",
            "So I\u2019m also telling that I prefer software over hardware firewalls because it\u2019s a better quality of revenue and lower cost of ownership for the customer and there is security posture. So for all those reasons, I guess, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, firewall platform were 19% for this quarter. So we\u2019re on share. We\u2019re just shifting from hardware to software and that\u2019s part of our mission."

So you -- from an M&A perspective, you have done a decent number of deals. I would say none of them have been large deals, maybe bordering on mid-to-large. How do you think about the balance sheet limiting the size of the deals you do and you\u2019ve used a little bit of stock in those deals?

So that\u2019s the motion we have now developed. We\u2019ve learned. We got better are acquisition we do. We\u2019re more prepared. We get them streamlined much faster, integrate them much faster. That motion is working and that\u2019s worked for us have done so far and we\u2019re really happy about it.",
            "Now in that case, the price of everything we bought is more correlated where we see the potential and where we see the opportunity and where we believe it\u2019s a unique asset. It\u2019s less to do with how much revenues agree with them, because we actually have plans revenue to think there\u2019s a huge opportunity, that\u2019s why we want to touch base on, that\u2019s something world class security, we may have eight or 10 deals. We could have gotten there a lot to Poracota. So that\u2019s the logic. When you say transformation, I think that\u2019s good for a larger deal, which\u2026"

When it goes to a software model, that\u2019s a different deployment model because there\u2019s marketplace Google, there\u2019s marketplace [inaudible] going to make sure your products fully enabled in the marketplace for some customers that is applying aftermarket places.",
            "So they\u2019re becoming a channel to some degree. Many SIs and many SPs in the last two years, three years have done a lot our security practice. They\u2019re becoming a channel. We go and say, I\u2019ll do network transformation, not bring all the pieces, I\u2019ll bring SD-WAN, I\u2019ll bring secured in there because the customer says, getting me off MPLS, get me out of SD-WAN, you do it, right?",

Now, again, they come in and say, well, to help you cannot pay on security past we will bring security with us. So a lot more parts that we investigate. We are doing well. We made a lot of windows.

            "Well, that\u2019s something we spent a lot of time over the last six months working on and I think one of the things our teams are really proud of, we launched something called FLEXWORK, which by the way when conversation with other companies want to look at the model and see if they want to deploy.",
            "They flipped the entire business to employee to us. We\u2019ve been working a lot of automation over the last six months, where everybody is going out but have the ability after November to choose to benefit. So we no longer have that benefit. We\u2019re going to get it in gyms and cafeterias, it will start taking the money and redeploying the people they want to use.",
            "So there\u2019s a lot of work going on the benefits, say, a lot of work going on where you choose to work from. There\u2019s a lot of work going on online learning programs. We just finished a six weeks of learning of all of our teams.",
            "But apart from that the biggest difference has been that I\u2019ve had monthly calls with the entire company from our behalf answered every question. I\u2019ve had -- I\u2019ve talked to about three groups of 50 employees each week randomly choosing across the company. I talked to our entire leadership team is about 175 and I talk to all the leaders once a month and additionally, I do smaller groups of 20 across the leadership team three times every month, so I get to the -- when I get to resize cycles more than once a month. And I do that they have done.",
            "So there is a lot more in my team versus me, there\u2019s a lot more engagement needed to keep people aligned, to keep people motivated, because people are getting tired of this, it is no longer this meter is kind of new normal right this is nascent, there is only so many times I\u2019m going to sit in that room, but you are where I am and that\u2019s something different."

            "Tell me about it. Actually, we did have one more question coming. I just want to make sure because I know this individuals quite focused on your story. You\u2019ve talked about this token based sort of revenue model, consumption model. Can you talk about how prevalent you expect that to be over the course of fiscal \u201821 and what impact would that have on the way the business looks if that is the way that your customers choose to buy from you?"

            "And it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s kind of an insight there is that the biggest cost in enterprises the cost of a sales call. So if I have to go to an existing customer and sell them one more feature, it\u2019s an expensive proposition that goes through a contracting process, PLC process, convince the customer, spend lots of time and guess what I\u2019ve done it security by that, since you have a firewall. That\u2019s a very expensive sales call, if I can eliminate expensive sales calls, especially in areas where I\u2019m trying to add more product every quarter.",
            "So in Cloud, we went from one module to sell. If I go to the same customer seven times a week module, it\u2019s like seven times products, there\u2019s no leverage by doing them. And of course, when I have seven, I can go sale all seven, but as I\u2019m evolving, developing them if they go for separate.",
            "So we came up with this idea that everything is embedded in one minute. The first module when you walk in, I estimate based on what you want to use, you buy 1000 units. So the first thing and use the first module will decrement 10 units a month or 50 units a month is a lot. The second one you can start using right away and I tell you that if you start using it, you\u2019ll be getting better in your account.",
            "So what happened is that, for example, we merged a lot, we found a third of the customer started using the other product with the same agreement, with the same product. So we actually had like a salesforce, we started get them some usage.",
            "When we were third one and the fourth one, we expect to get more usage. So what happened is, you want to see a number right away when you launch it, but we will be able to tell you usage across multiple modules. So you\u2019ll see that our modules are getting more popular, which just means consumption is increasing, which means my renewal will come up faster and the size of it will be bigger because people are consuming faster.",
            "And we are going to this cloud transformation across the world, across every customer and the workforce are increasing and people\u2019s like, we had a customer who bought 10,000 workloads when we bought RedLock, when the 50,000, 10,000 are with us. And that\u2019s so the price the power consumption basically because then it gives us a natural renewal slow motion, which is the constant increase in ARR."
