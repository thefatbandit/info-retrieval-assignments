         "Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased that you\u2019re able to join us today. Before we begin this morning, I\u2019d like to remind you that we have prepared a presentation to supplement our discussion, which we\u2019ll be referencing throughout the call. The slides are available on our website at investors.portlandgeneral.com.",
         "Referring to Slide 2. Some of our remarks this morning will constitute forward-looking statements. We caution you that such statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. For a description of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our earnings press release and our most recent periodic reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which are available on our website.",
         "Leading our discussion today are Maria Pope, President and CEO; and Jim Lobdell, Senior Vice President of Finance, CFO and Treasurer. Following their prepared remarks, we will open the line for your questions.",
         "Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Maria."

      "Jim Lobdell": [
         "Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. I\u2019d like to walk through our quarter-over-quarter results. As Maria mentioned earlier, our earnings guidance \u2013 our earnings per diluted share of $0.43 is up $0.15 from the same period in 2019. Starting at $0.28 in the second quarter of 2019 on the slide, first, gross margin increased earnings a total of $0.04 per diluted share. This increase is a result of a $0.01 decrease in retail revenues, which includes the negative impacts of weather for the quarter and the effects of customer class composition on retail deliveries and a $0.05 increase in net variable power costs, which includes higher wholesale revenues driven by a surplus of hydro and wind in the region. Next, an $0.08 increase from lower operating and maintenance expense, which consists of $0.06 from reduced maintenance at our Boardman facility and a reduction in operating expenses for other fleet assets; a $0.07 benefit from lower administrative expenses from savings and outside services and lower incentives; and a $0.05 decrease from higher bad debt expense associated with COVID-19; a $0.01 decrease from higher depreciation and amortization expense due to greater plants in service in 2020; a $0.01 increase from other items, including higher returns on nonqualified benefit plan assets; and finally, a $0.03 increase from lower tax expense primarily due to PTC generation from strong wind production.",
         "On to Slide 8. We are continuing to monitor our liquidity as economic conditions evolve. Our balance sheet remains strong following actions taken earlier this year to improve our liquidity and ensure that we can continue to best serve our customers. We expect to fund 2020 capital requirements with cash from operations, issuance of debt securities and the issuance of commercial paper as needed. Earlier this week, our Board approved a dividend increase of $0.09 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a 5.8% increase. This increase follows the decision to hold the dividend flat in the first quarter as we assess the potential impact of the pandemic and is consistent with our long-term dividend guidance.",
         "In regulatory matters, last quarter, we filed with the Oregon Public Utility Commission to defer expenses associated with the impact of COVID-19 for potential recovery. The commission is conducting a process to determine the next steps, and we have yet to defer any COVID-19-related costs. Last month, Commissioner Letha Tawney was reappointed to the Oregon Commission, and we are pleased that she continues to represent our customers.",
         "Moving to Slide 9, which shows our updated capital forecast for 2020 through 2024, we are continuing to focus our investments on the reliability and resiliency of our system while minimizing the impact on customer prices. We are on track to execute our planned capital projects for the year and believe the adjustments to our liquidity and capital plan made last quarter were onetime events.",
         "Finally, I\u2019ll cover our earnings outlook for the remainder of 2020. We expect continued impact from the pandemic on the economy and the regional power picture. As Maria mentioned, we achieved $1.34 in earnings to date. With $1 remaining to reach the midpoint of our earnings guidance, I would like to cover a few considerations. Despite strong gross margin through the first half of the year and retail revenue above expectations, we expect lower gross margin in the second half of the year. We also anticipate a similar load composition to the second quarter; and as such, we\u2019re raising our full year load guidance assumption to flat on a weather-adjusted basis.",
         "Our commercial customers continue to face risks associated with the economic impact of the pandemic in Oregon, but the strength of residential and industrial energy deliveries has mitigated this. Despite this upward revision in demand, we are maintaining guidance due to the structure of the decoupling mechanism. Residential customer usage on a weather-adjusted basis that is above the established baseline is refunded to customers, while the commercial decoupling collections are capped at 2% of revenue for the commercial customer class. We\u2019re also experiencing a unique year in the power markets. We\u2019re currently $38 million below the PCAM baseline year-to-date due to favorable wind and hydro conditions in the region. We estimate that we will continue to remain below the baseline at year-end but within the established deadband range.",
         "This increase in power costs for the balance of the year is a result of the interaction of lower power prices in the region and our forward power position to serve anticipated loads. Additionally, as Maria mentioned, we are reaffirming our full year earnings guidance of $2.20 to $2.50 per share based on the assumptions outlined in our press release and our long-term EPS growth target of 4% to 6% over time.",
         "And now operator, we\u2019re ready for questions."

      "Maria Pope": [
         "Thank you, Jardon, and good morning. Welcome to Portland General Electric\u2019s earnings call. I hope that you\u2019re all staying safe and healthy during these unprecedented times. Today, I\u2019ll provide an overview of our financial results, updates on our economy and actions we\u2019ve taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Jim will provide more detail on our financial results as well as the outlook for the remainder of the year.",
         "Before I go through the quarter, I want to first address the social unrest that we are experiencing in our state, across our country focused on racial inequities and the ongoing protests that have placed Portland front and center. We\u2019re reminded daily that we are living in a historic time for our community and country. In this tumultuous time, corporations have an opportunity to use their influence for positive change. PGE is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. While we are proud of our work to date and making progress towards our DE&I goals, we know that there is much more to do. We\u2019re looking at all the ways we have impact through policy, employee hiring, promotion and retention as well as supporting the communities we serve. And we will do so while working together collaboratively with customers and communities as we continue to provide safe, reliable, affordable and clean energy.",
         "Now let\u2019s turn to the financial forecast and our performance on Slide 4. On our last earnings call, we lowered our guidance to reflect the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting drop in economic activity. Our response included reducing operating expenses as part of our ongoing commitment to control costs across the organization. For the overall quarter, revenue was strong under those circumstances and was led by high-tech and digital industrial deliveries. Favorable hydro and wind conditions across the region resulted in surplus energy and low power prices. Additionally, we were able to lower operating expenses due to operational efficiencies and lower dispatch rates at our generating plants. As a result, our second quarter 2020 net income was $39 million or $0.43 per share, which represents an increase of $0.15 when compared to 2019.",
         "You may recall the second quarter of 2019, we experienced the opposite conditions: record low hydro in the region and unfavorable weather, which negatively impacted our gross margin. With year-to-date earnings per share of $1.34, we are more than halfway to our midpoint of our guidance, making a solid first half of the year. The second half of the year presents challenges as the economic fallout from the pandemic will continue to impact retail revenue and wholesale market conditions. Retail deliveries for the balance of the year will also be impacted by the decoupling mechanism. Gross margin will face additional headwinds due to more normal power market conditions. Jim will further address both decoupling and power markets later in the call.",
         "While the first full year financial picture presents challenges, we continue to aggressively manage costs to drive strong business results and are reaffirming our revised full year guidance of $2.20 to $2.50, reflecting anticipated economic challenges that our customers and our community face. As we move forward, we continue to pay close attention to economic conditions in the course of the pandemic. Our first quarter forecast projected a gradual recovery into 2021. That forecast remains largely unchanged and our outlook for the balance of 2021 \u2013 excuse me, 2020 remains cautious.",
         "Turning to Slide 5. The economic impact of the pandemic on businesses, communities and residential customers is reflected in the spike in the unemployment rate, which rose from historic lows of 3% in March to 14% in April and is now 11%. In response to the economic hardship faced by our customers, we have paused collection of late fees and service disconnections and are working with customers to implement flexible payment options. The impact of economic conditions on energy usage has been relatively consistent with our forecast. Second quarter residential loads increased 7% on a weather-adjusted basis, and the number of customers increased by 1.6%. Industrial deliveries increased 3% on a weather-adjusted basis as our digital services and high-tech manufacturing customers continued their long-term trend of steady growth despite the pandemic. These increases were more than offset by a 16% decrease in the commercial sector, where declines were concentrated in hospitality, government, education and office buildings.",
         "Turning to Slide 6. We are on track to achieve our strategic targets and major capital projects. We\u2019ve had no significant supply chain or operational disruptions as a result of COVID-19. Wheatridge and the integrated operations center remain on schedule. In May, we announced our partnership with the Douglas County Public Utility District for a five-year power purchase agreement for capacity that provides up to 160 megawatts of emissions-free hydroelectric power. As part of this partnership, we will be providing load management and wholesale marketing and services, leveraging our power portfolio management expertise. Regarding future resources, we expect to issue one or more RFPs for the new emitting resources. Over the next several years, Portland General Electric in the region face growing capacity needs as regional coal resources are retired. We will also continue to assess the region\u2019s energy needs given long-term economic consequences of the pandemic and other factors and market dynamics.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim. Thank you."

And thank you for the details on the decoupling mechanism. I think that was something that we had talked about last quarter as well. But given just the year-to-date results and I think some of the benefit you had realized from certain better-than-expected demand trends, was the second half impact of the decoupling mechanism already somewhat anticipated? And if that was so, all else being equal, are you looking at something more in the upper half of the range? Or are there some other considerations beyond the decoupling that we should be considering?"

And so we were looking at not only the economic impact of the pandemic but our regulatory environment as we move forward. Let me let Jim walk you through a little bit in more detail on how the decoupling mechanism works."

            "Yes. Thanks, Maria. Insoo as I was mentioning in my statement, when we look at the residential customers, they\u2019re actually up more than what we originally anticipated. But at the same time, we are seeing more of a downside on the commercial side than expected, and we\u2019re continuing to see strength in the industrial side. So on the residential, that\u2019s being completely decoupled away. On the commercial, as I had mentioned earlier, once you hit that 2%, then effectively, you can no longer collect from customers at a future point in time associated with that. And then the industrial is helping to offset some of what we are experiencing on the commercial side as far as \u2013 on recovery."

So just from what you recorded in the second quarter, the residential benefit that you received \u2013 that you saw in the second quarter, from an income statement or earnings purposes, weren\u2019t really a benefit to earnings? Or is there actually a timing component where that would reflect it in the second quarter but then you actually have to adjust that in the later quarters?"

Any \u2013 the refund to customers that would occur associated with amounts over the weather-adjusted baseline that was set in our 2019 general rate case will be refunded back to customers in the 2022 time period, if I\u2019ve got it correctly."

And in terms of the CapEx that you had deferred, whether it\u2019s 2020 or 2021 at last quarter, I know you didn\u2019t really change that for now and you spoke on being more cautious if things start to slowly improve throughout the balance of the year and early into next year. Could you see a bulk of that coming back in the 2021 time frame? And at this point, for 2020, do you not anticipate any reopening of those \u2013 of capital for the rest of the year?"

One of the things we noted on the prior call was our positive growth in the high-tech sector. And if there are new customers that come into our area and there are some in current conversations with us around additional capital investment they may need, let\u2019s say, for new substations or for other build that\u2019s particular to their operations, then that would be an upside."

During the early days of the pandemic, there were a lot of unknowns with regards to our economic environment and we remain taking a cautious stance. But we announced at that point in time that we would continue to reassess our dividend, engage with the Board on the discussion. And what we\u2019re doing is proceeding with what otherwise would have been sort of our normal course in terms of maintaining healthy financial environment. Did you hear me?"

We\u2019ve used the crisis in many ways to accelerate our use of technology, to reduce costs and to really focus on what matters to customers.

As you know, we took out 10-year first mortgage bond earlier this year, and then we did a bank loan that helps shore up the finances of the company because, obviously, we didn\u2019t know where things are going to go from a COVID economic impact perspective. And so as we\u2019re looking at our financing for the balance of the year, given the fact that FERC has come out with a waiver on the imputation \u2013 or the implications of short-term debt in the AFUDC crediting rate. We are looking at how we\u2019re going to time the repayment of that bank loan and whether the timing associated with additional long-term debt that we would take out in probably Q4 of the year around $190 million possibly."

It looks like you\u2019re now [Audio Dip] $38 million. So it was $18 million incremental positive benefit in the second quarter. Is that in the $0.05 of year-over-year gross margin benefit that you discussed, even though it\u2019s below the baseline and it\u2019s within the 9/10 sharing because that calculation isn\u2019t made until year-end.

As an essential service provider during these extraordinary times, delivering consistent, reliable power services to our customers is our highest priority. Ensuring the continuity of our generation fleet, the interaction and our capabilities in power markets, the transmitting of that power and distributing it to our customers\u2019 day in and day out is our highest priority. And I can tell you with the stress that families and customers and the communities that we serve are going through, ensuring that we\u2019ve minimized outages, create payment plans that work for them, access LIHEAP and Oregon HEAP funds to support those that are struggling is \u2013 takes an enormous amount of focus.",

We have a long ways to go with regards to this economic recovery, and there\u2019s a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And we will remain focused on investing in our system prudently and to ensure reliability. All of us have aging assets, but we also have the opportunities to reduce costs through technology."

One of the things that we have noted in this process is that we\u2019re one of the early companies in announcing our dividends, and we\u2019re going to think about what\u2019s the most prudent and practical thing to do as we move forward. We do recognize that a dividend and a solid dividend policy is important to investors and helps create financial stability for the company as we continue to move forward into the future."

We\u2019ve also worked collaboratively with the communities we serve to enhance our ability to work in the right-of-way and lower our costs in some instances in serving customers. We will continue to do that. But it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re really working hard to minimize cost increases due to the pandemic and use this period of time, as I\u2019ve talked about, to accelerate our opportunity for success as we go forward through lowering costs because we know that affordability is that much more important to customers today than it ever has been."

There are items that \u2013 we don\u2019t have too many employees that are jumping on airplanes. Actually, I can\u2019t imagine anybody jumping on airplane for us. We are maintaining our head count and trying to reduce it. As Maria had mentioned, we are using more and more technology to be able to find operational efficiencies and processes that we have in the company. And we\u2019ve got 2,000 employees that are now working from home. So we\u2019re doing that very effectively.

We are hoping that commercial will certainly come back, and we talked a little bit in our prepared remarks around what we\u2019re expecting in terms of our forecast. Long term, 0.5% increase in our commercial deliveries is our expectation. And where we really benefit, and we\u2019ve been talking about for quite a while, is the growth in high-tech and digital manufacturing in our region. And we\u2019re looking at just under 2% on sort of ongoing growth in that area.

We\u2019re still investing in, as Maria talked about, in reliability of the system and with new MLA or master \u2013 or minimum load agreements we\u2019ve been entering into with customers and so on and so forth. We are making capital additions. We also have the Wheatridge facility coming in, but that will come in through a renewable adjustment clause. And then we\u2019re making to the point of reliability of our systems, especially we designed this facility for an earthquake, and now we\u2019re dealing with \u2013 who knows when what\u2019s going to happen. But it\u2019s key to the recovery of the state and the communities that we serve. But now we\u2019re dealing with something else we didn\u2019t predict, and that\u2019s a pandemic.
