         "Good afternoon, everyone. I am Brett Larsen, Chief Financial Officer of Key Tronic. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today for our investor call. Joining me here in our Spokane Valley headquarters is Craig Gates, our President and Chief Executive Officer.",
         "As always, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we might make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the company\u2019s future financial performance. Please remember that such statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. For more information, you may review the risk factors outlined in the documents the company has filed with the SEC, specifically our latest 10-K, quarterly 10-Qs and 8-Ks. Please note that on this call, we will discuss historical financial and other statistical information regarding our business and operations. Some of this information is included in today\u2019s press release, and a recorded version of this call will be available on our website.",
         "Prior to getting into the details of the results of the most recent quarter, I would like to give Craig some time to address this past fiscal year and the series of unanticipated events that impacted Key Tronic in its fiscal year 2020.",
         "Thanks, Craig. Today, we released our results for the quarter ended June 27, 2020. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we reported total revenue of $116 million, up 10% from $105.6 million in the same period of fiscal year 2019. During the fourth quarter, our revenue was constrained as a result of the temporary shutdown of our facilities in Juarez by the Mexican government due to COVID-19 pandemic and associated delays in restarting production. Our Mexico operations were completely shut down for roughly 2 weeks. However, recruiting efforts to fill positions on temporary leave due to potential vulnerabilities, ramping production back up, improving physical distancing and other COVID-related disruptions continued throughout the quarter.",
         "For the full year of fiscal 2020, total revenue was $449.5 million compared to $464 million in the same period of fiscal 2019. Throughout much of the year, our revenue was adversely impacted by disruptions to supply chains in China caused by trade tensions and then by the COVID-19 crisis, which delayed the arrival of key components and caused production delays. We\u2019ve seen most of our China suppliers come fully back online for production in the fourth quarter but continue to see some backlog and long lead times in certain custom microchips as demand has outpaced capacities.",
         "For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, net income was $1.5 million or roughly $0.14 per share compared to $800,000 or $0.08 per share for the same period of fiscal year 2019. Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 included a tax benefit from releasing a portion of the company\u2019s allowance on research and development credits taken in previous years of $1.3 million or $0.12 per share. For the full year of fiscal 2020, net income was $4.8 million or $0.44 per share compared to a net loss of $8 million or a loss of $0.74 per share for the fiscal year 2019. Excluding the goodwill and intangibles write-down that occurred in fiscal 2019, the company would have reported net income of $4.5 million or $0.42 per share for the fiscal year 2019.",
         "During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we incurred a variety of additional costs caused by the COVID-19 crisis, totaling approximately $2.2 million or $0.16 per share. These expenses are related to the temporary shutdown and restart of the Juarez facility as well as preventative measures and equipment for employees across all of our facilities in the U.S., Mexico, China and Vietnam. These included providing personal protective equipment to all of our employees, restructuring the production lines to provide for social distancing and other measures. We currently expect to incur about $1 million or $0.07 per share of similar expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, but of course, this is an estimate based on today\u2019s information and the assumption that the virus doesn\u2019t force future closures and that current labor constraints do not worsen.",
         "Further, the pandemic\u2019s adverse impact on revenue and expenses dampened our margins. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, gross margin was 7.4% and operating margin was 0.9% compared to gross margin of 7.9% and an operating margin of 1.3% in the same period of fiscal 2019. Without the impact of the disruptions from the pandemic, our gross margins would have been closer to 9%.",
         "Turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong financial position. As a result of production delays in the fourth quarter and the continued ramp in transfers of new programs, our inventory remained roughly flat with the prior quarter. In future quarters, we expect to see our net inventory turns increase to be more in line with expected revenue. Although we have a healthy balance sheet as well as flexibility in available bank debt, we feel it is prudent to preserve cash where possible should the pandemic again disrupt operations for an extended period. In this light, we are expecting to increase our total credit facility to give us more flexibility to ramp up production in the coming months. At the end of the fourth quarter, trade receivables were up $6.1 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the increased revenue levels and the timing of shipments late in the quarter. Our DSOs remained at about 60 days.",
         "Total capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were approximately $2.7 million and $8.3 million for the year. While this is less than we had originally planned to spend during fiscal 2020, we will continue to invest in our production facilities, SMT equipment and sheet metal and plastic molding capabilities as well as improvements in our facilities as we move into fiscal 2021 and prepare for growth.",
         "For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we currently expect to report revenue of between $118 million to $125 million and earnings of approximately $0.18 to $0.25 per diluted share. With that said, a lot of uncertainty remains in those estimates. We\u2019re working closely with our customers, key suppliers and employees to minimize effects of delays attributable to the continued global pandemic. While the company\u2019s facilities in the U.S., Mexico, China and Vietnam are currently operating and rigorously following current health guidelines, uncertainty as to the possibility of future temporary closures, customer demands and costs and future supply chain disruptions during the rapidly changing COVID-19 environment could significantly impact operations in coming periods. Due to the heightened risks associated with the pandemic, we may issue updated guidance during the upcoming quarter.",
         "In summary, while the COVID-19 crisis continues to cause disruptions in the fourth quarter and remains a risk in future periods, we are encouraged by our prospects for future growth. The overall financial health of the company is strong, and we believe that we are increasingly well positioned to win new EMS programs and to continue to profitably expand our business over the longer term. That\u2019s it for me. Craig?"
      ],
      "Craig Gates": [
         "Okay. Thanks, Brett. 2020 was a year of significant and unusual challenges and rewards for Key Tronic. The dedication and courage of our employers \u2013 employees, the support of our customers both near and long term, and the strategic decisions we made both recently and years ago enabled our promising exit of fiscal 2020 and encourages us for the coming year. We began the year with a trade war between U.S. and China, which was layered on top of a persistent worldwide supply pinch for electronic components. Due to the long hours and extreme effort of our materials groups on both sides of the ocean, we worked our way through most of the supply issues albeit with painfully high levels of component inventory and some missed revenue opportunities. While the trade-war-related supply issues hurt us in the short term, they put the risk associated with an overly China-centric supply chain in clear focus for many of our current and prospective customers. As those customers began to assess their options, the benefits of our strategic focus on Juarez and U.S. production became clear to many of them. New business wins were the result.",
         "Over the years preceding 2020, our concerns surrounding China-centric strategies had led us to evaluate many other regions and prepared plans for diversification. As a result of this earlier work, we were able to launch and commission a new facility in Vietnam, which was up and running in about 7 months. This unprecedented ramp put us in an excellent position to address the needs of customers looking for an agile solution to China-centric sourcing. The ramp of our Da Nang facility continues with new business and new customers. Just as we gained some control over the trade war supply issues, COVID-19 hit, our employees were suddenly at risk. Scientifically proven safety measures were up for debate. Our Juarez facility, along with many other Juarez facilities, was closed for essentially 2 weeks. And supply chain issues, which were bad already, were enormously magnified. Our gaming customer demand went to 0. We implemented every safety measure we could in our facilities with overprotection as our goal.",
         "COVID-19 so far is a net positive to our business. Our focus on medical products over the past years resulted in a net gain in revenue as the virus drove demand, more than offsetting the decline in other COVID-affected businesses. China-centric potential customers who were concerned but on the fence during the trade war were pushed off the fence by the virus and pushed in our direction. Our sites in Juarez, the U.S. and Vietnam served as a powerful risk mitigator for these customers, with several choosing to write new business in 2 or more of our locations. We enter 2021 with a forecast for growth and increased profits, that is due to the courage, hard work and strategic foresight of our employees, the support and trust of our new and established customers, and the support of our shareholders. For that, I am profoundly grateful. Brett?",
         "Okay. Thanks, Brett. 2020 was a year of both powerful global headwinds and tailwinds. Through much of the year, we confronted component shortages and trade disputes related to suppliers in China. For the close of the year, we faced COVID crisis directly, which temporarily halted production in Mexico as well as disrupted production and added costs across all of our facilities. These are unprecedented and challenging times, and this pandemic affects all of us. I\u2019ve been humbled by the stalwart dedication of Key Tronic employees as they work to manage through this crisis. Our primary focus continues to be to ensure as best we can that our employees and their families stay safe. Within the constraints of our efforts to keep everybody in the Key Tronic family healthy, we\u2019re doing our best to maintain production in all of our facilities. We have been taking and we\u2019ll continue to take precautionary measures to limit the risks. Our most vulnerable staff and many of our non-manufacturing employees now work from home, and travel is very tightly restricted. We\u2019ve implemented all recommended safety measures in our manufacturing facilities. This includes full-time wearing of face masks and face shields, workstation arrangements to provide for social distancing, temperature monitoring, enhanced work site disinfection, spacing in cafeterias and break areas, contact management and more.",
         "Some of our suppliers have experienced temporary closures resulting from government lockdown and shelter-in-place orders. So far, we\u2019ve either been able to work around these temporary disruptions or closures have been resolved. We\u2019re also managing transportation complexities and disruptions to our supply chain via alternate sourcing, airfreight, product redesigns and alternate component qualifications. We\u2019re closely monitoring inventories and we\u2019ll use safety stock as much as possible to ensure minimum interruption. At this point in time, we have been able to find solutions for most of these challenges.",
         "In spite of the many challenges we faced, fiscal 2020 generated strong and encouraging tailwinds for our business. Uncertainty over tariffs and trade tension between U.S. and China, combined with disruptions caused by the pandemic, have further intensified a growing consensus among many of our customers and potential customers. They see more clearly that the total cost and risks of over-reliance on manufacturing in China are actually higher than for a balanced, more shared mix of supply out of China and localized supply chains. Shortened supply chains, supported by localized vertical integration, are becoming more widely understood and highly desirable. Moreover, our customers and potential customers increasingly want their IP maintained in the U.S., where there is more enforceable ownership and maintenance of their IP.",
         "As we\u2019ve discussed before, Key Tronic is ideally situated to benefit from these global trends of moving away from over-reliance on China manufacturing. A growing number of existing and new customers are transitioning from China facilities to our expanding facilities in Mexico, Vietnam and the U.S. Facilitated by our centralized command and control we can drastically reduce the risk and time associated with such a transfer. At the very least, diversifying the geographies of our customers\u2019 manufacturing sources allows some leeway to respond to the rapidly changing political and health landscape. The year was a whipsaw experience between the upside of these favorable geopolitical trends and the downside of COVID-19 impact on our component supply chains and its effects on our operations and workforce. By the end of the year, the upside had overcome the downside. Demand from many of our customers remained strong in the fourth quarter, and some customers significantly increased their demand, particularly programs for health care and home-oriented consumer products and exercise equipment.",
         "While our marketplace remains very competitive, we continue to win significant new business both from EMS competitors and existing customers. During the year, we won new programs involving consumer products, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, LED lighting, flight controls for aircraft, personal safety, WiFi-enabled signage, temperature control devices, home exercise, sanitizer dispensing, automotive controllers, oil and gas drilling, wireless security, and consumer health care equipment. A large program that we announced in the third quarter, which when fully ramped, is anticipated to contribute $100 million in annual revenue. That\u2019s underway in the fourth quarter and is expected to contribute to revenue in fiscal 2021.",
         "Last but certainly not least, we now manufacture face masks by the millions in our Corinth, Mississippi facility and high-end respirators in our Oakdale, Minnesota facility. Our broader and more diversified customer base lowers the potential future impact of a slowdown of any one customer. Our steady pipeline of new business opportunities continues to be boosted by our unmatched level of vertical integration, our multi-country footprint and the excellence of our manufacturing sites in comparison to other EMS competitors of our size. As OEMs face a pandemic layered on top of an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape, we are uniquely equipped to offer risk mitigation with our vertical integration and manufacturing facilities located in Mexico, Vietnam, China and the U.S.",
         "While we are carefully managing our expenses, we\u2019ve been preparing for growth in coming periods. During fiscal 2020, we continued to invest in our facilities, including the expansion of SMT, sheet metal and plastic molding capabilities in Mexico and the U.S. With respect to integrated electronics and sheet-metal-centric programs, we see very strong growth and very few real competitors of our size in North America. We also deployed innovative new manufacturing equipment in each of our facilities, which has improved efficiencies and has made our production less labor-intensive. The result of this effort has been decreasing manufacturing and operating expenses while making us increasingly well positioned for the returning tide in North American-based customers. Additionally, we are continuing to ramp production in our new, 86,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Vietnam to augment our Asian footprint and reduce production costs as well as providing additional hedge against uncertainty with respect to COVID-19-related disruptions to China production as well as the lingering or future trade wars with China.",
         "As we enter fiscal 2021, considerable uncertainty remains around the continuing impact of COVID-19 and potential future disruptions to our workforce and operations. There is also the related risk of a deeper economic downturn. Nevertheless, we entered the fiscal year with a positive momentum. We continue to invest in new capacity and remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities for growth. In closing, I want to thank all of our great employees for their hard work and dedication during these challenging times and for adhering to our strict guidelines for precautions during the pandemic. Let me assure you that we will continue to make protecting the health of our employees our highest priority. I also want to wish you and your families\u2019 good health and safe passage during the pandemic.",

We\u2019ve had a number of customers who, at the beginning of the COVID crisis, shut us down entirely and thought that they would get no orders. And then as, I guess, the socioeconomic trends began to make themselves clear, these same customers not only turned us back on again, they went into full panic mode because people were doing things that they had never done before and they needed to buy product to enable those things. So we\u2019ve got a number of customers who are right now \u2013 2 months ago had a shutdown and are right now trying to double their forecast to us.

Nothing really happened. And now it\u2019s becoming more and more possible to have a smart home without running a bunch of wires. So in general, I see, as apparently Google does \u2013 they\u2019re a lot smarter than we are. So maybe they see something else.

So the folks that are on the \u2013 that are already penetrating into the home, like ADC or dot-com, other people, they\u2019re a lot more interesting than they used to be because there\u2019s a lot of money being spent on virtually wiring up of homes. So I think that\u2019s the overall trend. I think it\u2019s being accelerated by the fact that people are stuck in their homes quite a bit more than they used to be. So they want them to be cooler and work better, whereas before it was \u2013 you can live with the inconvenience. Now you\u2019re there 24/7 and something that was just stupid before, now it really bugs you. So you\u2019re willing to spend some money to fix it but..."

We have continued to drive the integration of the east into the west. The site in Vietnam is coming online nicely. We are becoming more efficient in Juarez. We were helped by the exchange rate. We were hurt by the death of gaming. So it\u2019s all these things mixed together, but in the end, it\u2019s the result of a long pole of working to make this better. I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen going forward, but it sure seems to me like all the bets we placed in the last 10 years on not China-centric, on vertical integration, on engineering services, on streamlining our facilities, on capital equipment in our facilities, on building out our sales channels. All these things are working a lot better, as they should over time, when you apply consistent pressure and effort to them. And you get lucky or you have foresight and people wake up and realize that they shouldn\u2019t have every one of their eggs in one basket."

This is \u2013 if you look back over the year \u2013 I haven\u2019t actually gone back and checked. I should. But I\u2019m almost positive this is, by far, the biggest number of programs we\u2019ve won and for sure, this is the most revenue, when you add it all together, that we won in any year since I\u2019ve been here."

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, that\u2019s a pretty big question. So you can shut me off when you get tired of the answer. But what typically happens in contract manufacturing is you are forced to drive a pretty hard deal in order to win the business. And you hope that over time, you can drive your efficiencies and you can put pressure on the suppliers over time or the components and get your margin back up to the target that you would like it to be. So that side of the equation says that if you\u2019re taking in at 7%, you\u2019re hoping you can drive it up to 9%. At the same time, a lot of it depends upon the age of the product that you take on. So if you win some product that\u2019s mature, that has a lot of through-hole components on it, a lot of the components are going obsolete and the customer doesn\u2019t want to spend money to redesign it, then you\u2019ve got the opposite pressure going on because you\u2019re trying to buy parts in a seller\u2019s market and you can\u2019t really put a lot of pressure on the component suppliers in order to drive the parts down. So the answer to your question depends on how hard we had to compete in the first place to win it. It depends on the age and maturity of the product that we won, depends on the psychological or cultural makeup of the customer. Some customers believe that a partnership is the best way to overall make the most amount of money. And so we may make a little bit more margin but overall save them more money. Other customers take the old-school purchasing approach and think that they should go into an e-bid process and bid the thing out every 6 months. So all those things coming together make it impossible for me to give you a simple answer to your simple question."
