         "Thank you, Tabitha. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Michael Hill, our Chief Accounting Officer and I will give prepared remarks and then we will take your questions.",
         "TransAtlantic utilized the SEC extension on following to facilitate the change to a Turkey-based auditing company and our reduction in Dallas F&A staff. Even though there was low activity and operations during the first quarter, the sale of our subsidiary Petrogas reserve adjustments and hedging activity along with market disclosures added some complexity to the filings, both our auditors, DMF led by Aslan Kaya and our staff completed the filings accurately.",
         "Cash flow from production dropped significantly from both the same quarter a year ago and from the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the significant drop in oil price and expanded basis differential coupled with reduced produce volumes. The second quarter will be worse.",
         "Our reduced cash flow will be needed to pay operating expenses and senior bank payments, which amortize through March 2021. Therefore, we do not expect to undertake additional drilling during that time, so production volumes will continue to decrease. Our current hedges will produce a realized oil price of $36 a barrel adjusted for index and basis differential through the debt amortization period.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Michael Hill to review the quarter's financial results.",
         "Thank you, Michael. We've faced a lot of challenges during the balance of the year and I refer you to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of the press release and to the full 10-Q filing for additional detail, and these all materialized from the pandemic and resulting all market changes during the first quarter.",
         "We'll now take your questions."

         "Thanks, Malone, and good morning everyone. As disclosed in our press release, along with our 10-Q filed yesterday, we provide an update on our first quarter 2020 operating results. We reported a net loss of $24.0 million or $0.38 per share during the first quarter of 2020 compared to a net loss of $5.4 million or $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 and a net loss of $3.9 million or $0.07 a share for the first quarter of 2019.",
         "Our 2020 first quarter revenues were $8.4 million. This was down 49% from the fourth quarter of 2019 and down 56% year-over-year. The decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was driven by a 43% decrease in our average realized price per BOE received and 10% decrease in sales. The decrease in revenues from the first quarter 2019 was driven by a 46% decrease in our average realized price per BOE received, an 18% decrease in sales volumes.",
         "Our 2020 first quarter G&A expenses were $2.4 million. This was down 34% from the fourth quarter of 2019 and down 23% from a year ago. The decrease in G&A from the fourth quarter of 2019 was due primarily to a decrease in personnel experience as well as accounting, tax consultancy and legal fees.",
         "Our 2020 first quarter production expenses were $3.5 million. This is up 7% from the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 41% from a year ago. The increase in personnel expenses in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses and contract labor and an increase in work over expenses compared to fourth quarter.",
         "In the first quarter of 2020, we recorded approximately $20.3 million in exploration, abandonment and impairment expense on our oil and gas properties. Of that $20.3 million, $11.7 million and $6.5 million related to the proved impairment on our Bahar and Selmo oilfields. This was a result of a steep decline in oil prices experienced as a result of market concerns about the economic impact from COVID-19.",
         "Additionally, we incurred $2.1 million of exploration expense for two successful wells during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2020, we completed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Petrogas, for cash proceeds of approximately $1.5 million. We did record a loss on the sale of approximately $10.1 million, which primarily related to the reclassification of the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment that was realized into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity.",
         "First quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDAX was $8 million as compared to $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $12.3 million in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in adjusted EBITDAX from the fourth quarter was due primary to a decrease in our revenues of $8.1 million and an increase in production expense of 200,000. This is partially offset by our realized hedge gains of $6.5 million and a decrease in G&A of $1.2 million.",
         "The decrease in adjusted EBITDAX from the first quarter of 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in revenues of $10.7 million and an increase in production expense of $1 million. This is partially offset by our realized hedge gains of $6.5 million and a decrease in G&A expense of $0.7 million.",
         "On March 9, 2020, we unwound our three-way collar and swap oil contract with DenizBank and realized 6.5 million in proceeds. We used these proceeds to repay a portion of our term loan with DenizBank and made two additional amortization payments during the quarter for total debt reduction of $9.4 million. This left our total gross debt balance with DenizBank at $10.6 million as of March 31, 2020.",
         "As part of the hedge on the line and subsequent pay down, DenizBank extended a grace period for principal repayments until the end of June, when they will continue with one monthly installment of 600,000 and second subsequent installments of 1.4 million beginning in July until maturity. As of March 31, 2020, our consolidated working capital was 3.2 million with slight increase from 2 million from the fourth quarter of 2019.",
         "Our capital expenditures were 2.9 million during the first quarter of 2020, as compared to 4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and -- our fourth quarter sales of '19 and 9.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. We expect our capital expenditures for the remainder of 2020 to be minimal with range between 1 million to 1.5 million; however, this is subject to change at the discretion of the Board.",
         "I'll now hand the call back over to Malone."
