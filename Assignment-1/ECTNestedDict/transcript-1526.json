      "Andy Hendricks ": [
         "Thanks Mike. Good morning, and welcome to Patterson-UTI\u2019s conference call for the second quarter of 2020.",
         "We are very pleased with our performance during the second quarter in both contract drilling and pressure pumping. With our largest business, contract drilling, we are especially pleased with our results, as we were able to act quickly to reduce costs and increase margins. We greatly appreciate our strong customer base for their support, and we believe we have seen improvements in market share in active contract drilling rigs and in pressure pumping spreads as a result of the strength of our commercial relationships.",
         "Our employees have done a great job, and we appreciate all of their efforts during these extraordinary times. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and their families and continue to take measures in the field and in our facilities to provide a safe and healthy working environment.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Andy Smith, who will review the financial results for the quarter ended June 30. I will then comment on our operational highlights, as well as our outlook before opening the call to Q&A.",
         "Andy?",
         "Thanks Andy.",
         "In contract drilling, our average rig count for the second quarter was 82 rigs, down one-third and in line with our expectation. I am pleased that our rig count has outperformed that of the broader market during this tumultuous time. In addition to our contract coverage and our fleet of technically advanced super spec rigs, I believe our outperformance is also due to the diversification of our customer base, probably the broadest in the industry, and our geographic footprint.",
         "We operate in all of the major unconventional drilling plays in the U.S. and have strong commercial relationships with customers ranging from global IOCs to well-capitalized privates. During the second quarter, approximately 20% of our rigs that earned revenue were idle. These rigs typically generate revenue at a discounted rate but have minimal associated costs, which is therefore dilutive to our average rig revenues and cost per day but relatively neutral at the rig margin per day line.",
         "Considering this mix impact, average rig revenue and cost per day decreased sequentially during the second quarter, with average margin per day increasing by more than $2,000 per day and exceeding our expectation, due to both higher-than-expected revenue per day and lower-than-expected cost per day.",
         "The biggest driver for the better-than-expected margin per day was a significant effort by our team to reduce cost by aligning our structure with the changing activity levels. In the Western Canadian market, given our longer-term outlook, we closed our Canadian drilling operations during the second quarter, and we are currently marketing those assets for sale. We were very pleased with the drilling performance by our team and technology in Canada, where the APEX XK rig that we previously had in the market had the leading multi-well pad footage performance in the Montney basin according to the operator\u2019s analysis.",
         "Unfortunately, the Western Canadian market has not been able to financially justify that level of technology for the last couple of years, and we don\u2019t believe that activity levels are going to improve in the foreseeable future.",
         "As of June 30, 2020, we had term contracts for drilling rigs, providing for approximately $335 million of future day-rate drilling revenue. Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 51 rigs operating under term contracts during the third quarter and an average of 38 rigs operating under term contracts during the four quarters ending June 30, 2021.",
         "Turning to the third quarter. We expect that our rig count including rigs on standby will be approximately 59 rigs, in line with our current rig count. The proportion of rigs that are idled but generating revenue is expected to increase to approximately 30% of our expected rig count, which will be further dilutive to our average rig revenue and cost per day.",
         "We do not expect any lump sum early termination revenue in the third quarter. Additionally, with our average rig count expected to be down more than 25% quarter-over-quarter, our costs will be negatively impacted by lower fixed cost absorption. Accordingly, margin per day is expected to be approximately $8,600 for the third quarter.",
         "Turning now to pressure pumping. We averaged four active spreads during the second quarter, in line with our expectation. Pressure pumping revenue for the second quarter was $59.5 million with a margin of $3.3 million, which was also in line with our expectation. Given the magnitude of the downturn across the industry in the second quarter, we are very pleased with these results.",
         "Pressure pumping restructuring cost during the second quarter was $31.3 million and included expenses for closing and consolidating facilities, severance and for exiting contracts with vendors that we no longer intend to utilize. We believe these changes are structural to the business and will result in significant cost savings, making our pressure pumping segment much leaner and more competitive.",
         "Excluding restructuring charges during the second quarter, as expected, we generated positive pressure pumping adjusted EBITDA. I believe that, as a Company, we continue to deliver Tier 1 operational performance in the field. One of our spreads recently set a customer record for pumping 23 stages in 24 hours and ultimately ended up completing 440 stages over 31 days. Our team at Universal Pressure Pumping likes to say that they are setting the Pressure Pumping standard, and I agree that they are doing just that.",
         "Turning now to the third quarter. We expect a slight improvement in frac activity with revenues increasing approximately 10%, and we expect to be positive cash flow.",
         "Turning now to directional drilling. Revenues were $11.7 million and operating costs were $12.3 million. Activity during the second quarter was lower than expected given the sharp drop in the horizontal rig count. Restructuring costs during the second quarter associated with directional drilling were $3.2 million, and we expect to reduce annual directional drilling operating expenses by approximately $10 million.",
         "During the second quarter, our superior QC business commercialized its latest well placement data analytics hi-fi navigation. This new remote operations product provides well bore position interpolation between survey stations based on well steering operations in order to improve the operator\u2019s well placement operations and improve overall drilling performance. For the third quarter, we expect directional drilling revenues of approximately $10 million and gross margin of approximately breakeven.",
         "Turning now to our other operations which includes our rental, technology and E&P businesses. Revenues in the second quarter were $8 million with direct operating costs of $9.1 million. Our E&P operations were negatively impacted during the second quarter as we chose to curtail oil production rather than sell into what was an extremely oversupplied market.",
         "We also took a $1.1 million charge related to a lease that we allowed to expire rather than drill in the current market. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be flat with the second quarter and for gross margin to be approximately breakeven.",
         "Before we open the call for questions, I wanted to recognize the response of our team to the record decline in drilling and completion activity this quarter. Their efforts and execution quickly aligned our structure with the changing activity levels and helped to improve our margin results and maintain our strong liquidity position while maintaining strong operational performance.",
         "While we have taken dramatic steps to align our structure with current market conditions, we have not taken our eyes off the future of our company or the industry. We continue to invest in our technology initiatives around both automation and remote operations, as we believe the leaders in these technology areas will be the winners coming out of this downturn.",
         "A recent well drilled in Texas showcased our abilities in these areas. Our combined teams from Patterson-UTI drilling with an APEX super-spec rig, MS Directional with the latest generation of Empower MWD and impact motors and Superior QC\u2019s remotely operated hi-fi NAV advanced well bore placement algorithms all worked together with an operator to drill what is arguably one of the most complex directional wells in the U.S., where the horizontal section is in the shape of a U and more than 10,000 feet long for production from the two lateral sections.",
         "The well was jointly planned and executed with the operator where the directional drilling operation had low enough tortuosity that it did not even require any high cost rotary steerable systems to complete the complex shape across such a long horizontal distance.",
         "We are excited about this drilling success and look forward to the next complex well construction challenge that pushes the technical envelope. We have seen over the history of our industry where major downturns have helped to drive technology adoption in the oil field in order to improve performance, even when budgets are tight.",
         "In drilling, we saw the industry accelerate the move towards AC high spec rigs following 2008. Similarly, super-spec rigs were the rig of choice after 2016. We believe the next move will be towards more remote operations and automation technology layered onto existing rig assets. We believe that we are well positioned with our various technologies at Patterson-UTI, including our CORTEX operating system, to facilitate the automation of discrete operations and our CORTEX edge data servers for the next generation of drilling data analytics.",
         "Wrapping up, these have been difficult times with difficult decisions for our teams. And I would like to commend them again for their business and operational execution. With our strong operational performance, technology capabilities and our strong balance sheet, I am confident that we will emerge from this downturn even stronger. With that, we would like to thank the hardworking men and women who make up this company. We appreciate your continuing efforts.",
         "Julian, we would now like to open the call up to questions."
      ],
      "Andy Smith": [
         "Thanks Andy.",
         "As set forth in our earnings press release issued this morning, for the second quarter we reported a net loss of $150 million or $0.81 per share, which includes certain pretax charges totaling $55.8 million and a $4.2 million pretax gain related to an insurance settlement. Excluding these items, the net loss for the quarter would have been $105 million or $0.56 per share.",
         "The $55.8 million of pretax charges includes $38.3 million of restructuring costs and $17.5 million of non-cash impairment charges, of which $8.3 million is included in depreciation, depletion and amortization and is related to the closure of our Canadian drilling operations. And $9.2 million is included in other operating expense to reduce the carrying value on our balance sheet of a deposit placed in 2017 for future sand purchases.",
         "Of the $38.3 million of charges, only $7.5 million was a cash outlay during the second quarter. Excluding the restructuring charges and non-cash impairment charges, adjusted EBITDA would have been $61.6 million for the quarter.",
         "Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash balance at June 30 was $247 million, an increase of $95 million from last quarter, largely due to a decrease in working capital excluding cash. Our liquidity improved to $847 million, including $600 million available under our undrawn revolver.",
         "Our balance sheet remains favorably positioned with a relatively low debt to cap and only limited near term maturities that can easily be handled by cash on the balance sheet. Our 2020 CapEx forecast remains unchanged at $140 million.",
         "Before I turn the call back to Andy for the third quarter, we expect SG&A of approximately $22 million, down approximately $2 million from the second quarter. We expect depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense of approximately $157 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. Lastly, we will be paying our quarterly cash dividend of $0.02 per share on September 17, 2020, to holders of record as of September 3, 2020.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Andy Hendricks."

            "So, Andy, to start, I was hoping we could talk a little about some of the dynamics that you\u2019ve experienced that have led to that relative resilience in your rig count relative to the overall Lower 48. Exposure to the Northeast certainly has helped, but it sounds like aside from the majors, there has been perhaps more pressure among public E&P budgets relative to privates. Just curious how you see that dynamic playing out or how it has played out for your fleet? And then how does that inform your look forward in terms of activity for the balance of the year?"

Our operations teams continue to execute in the field in top tier performance. And if you look at this broad base of customers that Patterson-UTI has traditionally always have.",
            "We work for some of the largest oil companies, and we will work for private companies that most people haven\u2019t heard of, but they\u2019re also well capitalized. And we\u2019ve had these relationships in place for a long time.",
            "And our businesses have done a great job working with customers in this downturn and these relationships have had us \u2013 allowed us to have these kind of tough discussions in a very difficult environment and hang on to work at times when it might have been difficult otherwise. So I want to congratulate our teams for the great work that they\u2019re doing in the field and once again I want to thank our customers because it\u2019s been a lot of difficult discussions this quarter. But I think we\u2019ve all worked together to find a good outcome in a very challenging environment."

            "Well, thanks Andy. I appreciate that. On the pumping fleet, you did about $60 million in revenue for four fleets. So that\u2019s $60 million annual revenue per fleet. You\u2019re expecting 10% improvement in 3Q. How much of a gap would you say there is between the volumes that you had in the second quarter, maybe on average for the quarter, and the capacity for those four fleets? And then what do you need to see besides any improved pricing? What else is needed to justify re-staffing another fleet?"

         "Remarks": [
            "You know the Pressure Pumping business, we have had some challenges in the past. We\u2019d underperformed. We really needed to be able to show the market that we could run this business the way it needed to be run. The way we\u2019ve run it historically. We\u2019ve been in the business for a long time. And I think this quarter finally highlighted during very difficult challenges that we have a lot of experience running the Pressure Pumping business and we were able to hang onto four spreads on average, working through the quarter, which I think finished up better than probably some of our of competitors that are out there in the field. But it was a very difficult and challenging environment. I don\u2019t want to understate what happened in the second quarter. And our teams did a great job hanging onto the work.",
            "Pricing is still a big challenge out there in the market. It was before we even got into this downturn after the decline in activity in 2019, and pricing remains a challenge in this environment. But we do see some opportunity to increase activity in the third quarter.",
            "We\u2019re also cautious about how much activity we take on because we don\u2019t want to spend any more money and accelerate any kind of OpEx or CapEx going into the third quarter just because we don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into the fourth quarter and suspect that given where commodity prices trade, the fourth quarter could have its traditional strong seasonality in the second half and could see some slowdown at that point. So I think we\u2019re a little bit cautious. We do think we can get a bump by about 10% in activity in revenue going into the third quarter, but that\u2019s about the most visibility we have at this point, I would say.",
            "In terms of costs to reactivate, right now they\u2019re minimal, just because if we needed to reactivate a spread, it wouldn\u2019t take much since some of these spreads were working just not too long ago, just a few months ago. So any near-term reactivation would have very minimal cost to it. And we could bring people on fairly quickly to do that without a lot of overhang on compensation costs. So those general reactivation costs would be fairly low. We don\u2019t have a lot of visibility that we need to do that, but we do see potential to increase the amount of activity in the third quarter by about 10%."

            "So your daily margins on the contract drilling side were certainly above expectations in second quarter. And I\u2019m trying to think through what the implication might be going forward. So I guess a two-part question here. Any idea how much longer you may have a big chunk of the fleet on standby, just asking that given that it kind of skews the daily P&L metrics that we look at. And then related, maybe just getting to the punch line, is 14,000 to 14,500 a day still a fair range to think about for \u201cnormalized daily cost\u201d? Maybe that will help level set expectations?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Tommy Moll"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So in terms of the number of rigs that are on standby, it\u2019s really going to be market driven at this point. We just don\u2019t have much more visibility than what we\u2019ve given you in the third quarter. The good news is, we\u2019re saying that our rig count stabilizes at this point and remains fairly steady. We don\u2019t expect our rig count to go down. We still have some movement in the rig count, if you\u2019re watching the maps, we may have a few rigs go down and a few rigs come up in combination. But, overall, we see that rig count stabilizing at this point, which is a positive after what we\u2019ve been through in the second quarter.",
            "But it will be up to the customers to decide when they take rigs off standby and put them back to work. And certainly, given where WTI\u2019s trading at this level, it doesn\u2019t give us a lot of visibility that we\u2019re going to see much of that right away. So we just don\u2019t have any visibility on that. So it\u2019s hard to answer how long some of these rigs are going to be on standby.",
            "In terms of the costs, the $14,000 to $14,500 per day of costs to operate a rig is a normalized cost, but we\u2019re now at a level of rig count where it\u2019s difficult to get the fixed cost absorption that we need to get as well. So there could be some variability and some creep on those overall costs to operate the rig, just because of the low rig count that we\u2019re at today. And so we\u2019ve still got some challenges that we have to work through, but the good news is that things are stabilizing at this point."

            "And then for a bigger picture question and sticking with contract drilling. There has been a lot of conversation in the marketplace about alternative contract structures. I wonder if you might offer us the PTEN house view on the potential adoption and your interest in potentially moving away from a day rate model in this next cycle?"

         "Speaker": "Tommy Moll"
      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So we\u2019ve been shifting some of our contracts, I would say, over the last year and a half to two years to various models that don\u2019t strictly include the day rate. Some include some performance. Some include some other elements in there. When we looked at the stack of contracts that we had in place in mid-July, about 30% of those contracts in place had other elements than just a day rate. So you could, about almost a third of our of contracts have some kind of performance combination to them or other element to them that\u2019s more than just a traditional day rate.",
            "So I think our teams have been doing a good job working with the customers to find solutions to the challenge that we all know that\u2019s out there where we continue to drill faster; we continue to improve efficiencies. And we need to try to monetize that as a drilling contract. I think our teams are doing a good job and they\u2019re moving in that direction. And that number was around 30% in mid-July."

            "Andy, I wanted to ask on what the discussions are like with customers, both on the rig side and the frac side. I know on the frac side it sounds like you\u2019re going to be cautious adding incremental spreads Q3 and beyond. But industry-wide it feels like frac activity kind of ticked up in June and probably more so in July. And just curious what your discussions are with customers about adding frac spreads and/or rigs in the back half of the year?"

      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Let\u2019s start with the frac. There are a number of customers that are out there talking to us, talking to other companies about increasing their activity. That may be adding spreads that may be just working current spreads at a higher number of stages per month or per quarter. So we\u2019re certainly involved in those discussions. And I think the industry will see a higher level of frac activity in the third quarter.",
            "We\u2019re going to be cautious about that as we approach those because we want to try to keep our costs in line. We\u2019ve made structural changes to the organization that we think can hold up for the long term. We think we can, over time as activity improves in general, grow the business without growing these structural costs that we\u2019ve taken out. So we want to be careful about that.",
            "I also would like to see pricing move up in frac. And we need activity to grow to push the pricing. And I think there\u2019s room for pricing to come up in frac. It\u2019s been at a level that\u2019s been a real challenge, but the improved activity could help that a little bit as well.",
            "Now there\u2019s still a lot of spreads that are on the sideline and a lot of companies that want to get spreads to work at just about any rate. But over time, if we can get the activity up, that\u2019s going to help pricing over time.",
            "In terms of drilling, our current visibility is that things are stabilizing. But in general, I\u2019d say the rig count is stabilizing. To really drive the frac business, we do need the rig count to move up and some point to increase the number of wells in inventory because what you\u2019re seeing on the frac is response to going back and fracking wells on pads that were halted during the second quarter as activity came down really quick.",
            "So we do need those inventories of wells to increase, so we do need the rig count to move up to really help the frac business. Right now, we don\u2019t have that visibility. And I think a lot of that\u2019s just going to depend on how commodity prices trade throughout the rest of the year."

         "Remarks": [
            "And then on the contract drilling side, I realize there\u2019s probably been almost zero opportunities for price discovery. But if we look at your Q3 guidance, you\u2019re basically guiding to 59 average rigs. You\u2019ve got 51 term contracts, so that would imply at least a little bit of spot activity in there. And so at a high level, is there any way you could help us think about where pricing is on a leading-edge basis on the drilling side moving forward, or at least in Q3?"

         "Speaker": "Taylor Zurcher"
      },
      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So I wouldn\u2019t say we have a lot working at the spot level. We have a number of rigs, a small number that are working on agreements that are less than what we would consider term contracts because they\u2019re less than six months. But the majority of these are an evergreen-type agreement where we\u2019ll drill a number of wells and then the agreement gets resigned and continues on and drills a number of wells.",
            "So there\u2019s really not a trade out there or a discussion with customers for us to really understand where we think leading edge or spot market sits in the drilling contract business. We\u2019ve just come off of the fastest decline in the rig count in the history of the industry. And the customers just haven\u2019t switched gears yet to have those discussions to say okay, what\u2019s it going to take to put rigs back to work? So I just don\u2019t think as an industry we know yet what leading edge really looks like."

            "And so pre-COVID frac pricing wasn\u2019t in a great position and with this recent downturn in the second quarter, I would say it\u2019s caused a lot of equipment to be on the sidelines where you have a lot of frac companies that just want to get equipment back to work at whatever stage price they can get it back to work. And then figure out the math after that.",

We\u2019re doing I think our team is doing a fantastic job managing the costs in that business right now. I do believe that if there is an increase in activity in the third quarter and if you see a bump in the rig count after that, that creates more inventory per frac, I think there\u2019s opportunity for companies to move the frac pricing up off this floor where it\u2019s at because it\u2019s certainly not sustainable where it\u2019s at.

And then just looking at the rig count in the various basins it would make sense that perhaps a lot of the subscale providers move out of certain basins. What would you consider optimal scale at the basin level?

So when you look at the cost to operate a rig, we\u2019ve always said that about two-thirds of the OpEx is labor that hasn\u2019t changed. There\u2019s an element of OpEx as well that is in our OpEx to operate a rig that we call out within the drilling company. We don\u2019t carry this in SG&A, but it\u2019s engineering. So when we\u2019re looking at engineering control systems, engineering data analytics systems, those are carried in OpEx, they\u2019re not carried in SG&A.",

And so that also adds up into that OpEx on a per rig basis. So those are the kind of things that are there. So you\u2019ve got compensation at the field level. You\u2019ve got our engineering spend that\u2019s in there, too. And so those kinds of things are what I would consider something that we want to hold onto right now.",
            "When you look at the various basins that are out there and what we consider to get critical, in the contract drilling business. We can work a single rig in a basin without a problem. We can scale the structure of that basin around that. We can provide support from a separate basin if we need to. The rig will sit as an island in a basin even if it\u2019s a single rig and we can manage that cost. Where our challenge was in Canada, we had a number of rigs that we had up there.",
            "We hadn\u2019t worked any recently and we just don\u2019t have an outlook on the Western Canadian basin that we think supports the level of technology that we want to be able to operate and which is really our specialty in the super spec rigs, layered on with data analytics and other elements that bring technology to the table for the operators. And so with Canada being a separate country, requiring legal entities, separate payroll, separate benefits, separate structures that posed a separate cost challenge for us.",

We just don\u2019t think that long-term the Western Canadian basin is going to support the level of technology that we work in the lower 48.

There are some plays and E&P actually drills in some plays where you can make money at $36, $38 a barrel. So there are some plays still out there. So it\u2019s \u2013 we could have a few rigs here and there today\u2019s oil price come back, but I wouldn\u2019t say it would come back in any magnitude.",

I think if WTI moves up into the upper 40s that there are number of operators that economically could put rigs back to work and be profitable drilling wells at those levels. So I don\u2019t think you have to get to $50 a barrel. I think that there\u2019s certainly areas of West Texas, New Mexico, with operators that have held their land positions for a long time that could be economical if we get north of $45."

I will tell you it wasn\u2019t a particular piece of technology, but it was a lot of preplanning effort and a lot of credit to the operations team out in the field working with the operator to plan how they were going to do this. And being able to preplan the job and take some of the \u2013 what would be considered non-pumping time.",

So this is an area where it wasn\u2019t necessarily technology, but it does illustrate that we have very good teams focused on being able to perform at the Tier 1 level, and that our equipment can do a great job in the field because that\u2019s a lot of stages to be pumped."

I don\u2019t know if you get broad numbers like that across the U.S. just because this may have been somewhat basin specific. So it may not be repeatable from basin-to-basin, but it does show that in the industry we continue to improve the economics for the operator."

We expect to be positive EBITDA and positive cash flow in the business. This is a tough market. We\u2019re down to operating four spreads. We do see some increase in activity in the third quarter. We\u2019re going to call out 10%, but I think that we\u2019ll just have to wait and see how that quarter shapes up. But I give a lot of credit again to our teams for getting costs out of the system and making us much leaner and more competitive."
