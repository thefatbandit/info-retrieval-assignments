         "Thanks, Ron. I\u2019m extremely pleased with our results for Q2 and how Crexendo was able to quickly react and adapt to the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. I will give a quick recap on the quarter from a sales perspective, and what impact we saw from COVID, I will also provide an update on our marketing efforts as well as our research and development efforts and finish with an overall assessment on our current environment.",
         "At the beginning of the quarter, we saw a dramatic slowdown in sales bookings as businesses struggled with adapting to the stay at home orders initiated in most of the country. Since our award winning technology allows businesses to quickly migrate to a remote worker environment.",
         "We started seeing sales rebound quickly in April and May and June, and so much higher sense of urgency and customers needing our technology during the digital transformation that the world is currently experiencing.",
         "Crexendo immediately rolled out programs for new customers to rapidly migrate to our platform with no activation fees, deferred payments and free collaboration tools to assist in their transition to remote workers.",
         "The migration of businesses from premise based equipment to the cloud was already in full swing prior to the pandemic. And the new normal businesses now find themselves in will only hasten that migration in the future.",
         "Even with the dramatic slowdown that we witnessed in April, we saw a rapid rebound that helped us increase our Unified Communications As a Service or UCaaS service revenue by 16% year-over-year, increase in revenue along with cost management led to GAAP net income of 508,000 or $0.03 per share for the quarter. This is our sixth consecutive quarter posting positive GAAP net income.",
         "And I\u2019m very pleased that we are continuing that trend, while most of our competitors in the industry struggle to reach or maintain profitability. Despite all of the headwinds in the economy, I expect our success and momentum to continue.",
         "Our revenue and sales growth for the quarter helped increase our sales backlog by 750,000 to 27.4 million. This was a healthy increase considering the initial slowdown experienced at the beginning of the quarter related to COVID.",
         "Our telecom sector gross margin was strong at 71% for the quarter, we are able to consistently sustain healthy gross margin since we have a very stable cost structure and since we own our intellectual property that is the foundation of our offering.",
         "Our continual focus on cost management within the organization helps us maintain profitability. This is a core message within our organization that has every employee focused on productivity and efficiency.",
         "Our strong results for the quarter helped increase our cash position to 5.1 million at the end of the quarter. As we have discussed on our previous calls, we are reinvesting back into the business including marketing initiatives, adding new hires, and creating new incentives to generate more sales as additional R&D to further enhance our offerings.",
         "In April, we hired a new Director of Marketing and have been busy updating our messaging and imaging for our partners, our customers, our prospects and our shareholders. We have updated all of our sales and marketing collateral, we have refined our email campaigns, and we will be launching our new corporate website later this month.",
         "Our uniformed look, we will be consistent across the board, whether we are presenting to an investor, prospect or partner, our message will be clear and consistent. We are also focused on increasing our lead generation efforts and our revised marketing campaigns have had an immediate positive impact.",
         "We are also continuously investing in research and development and saw an increase in our Q2 R&D spend. As we are constantly enhancing the Crexendo platform with new features and capabilities.",
         "Our new phones with bluetooth and WiFi capability have been a tremendous benefit in the remote work environment where people may not have the proper cabling infrastructure in their home, and our WiFi functionality allows them to perform flawlessly.",
         "Our texting, our video, our collaboration tools are also providing a great benefit to our customers. And those capabilities were recognized last month by the industry authority TMT as their communication solution products of the year for 2020.",
         "I think we can all agree that the first six months of 2020, have changed the business world forever. I don\u2019t think anyone could have predicted how quickly our country\u2019s economy would shift and how quickly the business world would transform. We believe that we have positioned ourselves extremely well to weather this storm and emerge stronger than ever.",
         "Our strong balance sheet combined with greater reliance on every business, to have communication infrastructure that will support their needs. It is a very bright future for Crexendo. Crexendo is one of the leaders in the UCaaS industry. And we are ideally suited to help businesses make the transition to the cloud.",
         "And we are extremely excited about the second half of the year and the opportunities that exist as businesses continue to adapt to the new normal of remote workforces. I\u2019m confident that we will continue to execute on our plans for revenue and income growth, and that we are in a strong position to deliver.",
         "I will now turn the call back over to Steve."

         "Jeff, would you please give the Safe Harbor statement.",
         "Thank Jeff. Welcome, everyone. This is now our second conference call under the new COVID-19 normal and the digital transformation that is taking place throughout the world, especially in the developed world.",
         "We hope [audio gap] everyone healthy and safe our company and our customers have been adapting to doing business in this environment. And I have always talked about the functionality of our phone service.",
         "We built the Crexendo, right, the clouds, [audio gap] adaptable, to move from the office to a remote location and back again. And while making the move, seamless, our functionality is one of the core parts of our business. And that functionality has literally been a lifesaver for [audio gap] our customers have been able to continue their business, moving their telephones and apps, while not skipping a beat.",
         "While, we did not build a service with COVID-19 in mind, we built it knowing that this was to have adaptability to allow business to work from remote locations. Business has been transitioning to the cloud. And this digital transformation COVID-19 has just accelerated the process - aimed at customers who are on legacy systems are going to need to move to the cloud to survive the new world of business.",
         "We also believe that Crexendo is the perfect solution for almost all businesses. We have won many awards for our service, including recently receiving the TMC Communication Solutions Service of the Year award. in addition to our core award winning service, we work with our customers to tailor specific solutions to their needs. And we are convinced that our solutions products, people and service are the best in the industry.",

         "All of these results are very impressive. We believe these results are a testament. When we built the cloud services, we wanted to make sure we had the best solution available. And I believe we accomplish, accomplished that. We then work to keep costs under control and we accomplished that. After that we work to achieve non-GAAP earnings, then followed by GAAP earnings, which we also accomplished.",
         "I think you are getting the picture. This quarter, we accomplished a NASDAQ up listing, which we did by organically growing the business. We now believe the time is right, to grow the business both organically and through creative acquisitions. We believe the NASDAQ listing gives us both the ability and currency to -.",

         "It appears we are now seeing less COVID-19 related downgrades and business terminations. The effort of our taking the keep America connected pledge also seems to be listening. Trends continue, but we obviously manage the business very carefully and we take appropriate action.",

Some of that was related to some one-time expenses in the first quarter. But overall, it is just our continued, focus on managing our business and expenses."

            "I think that was because twofold, one is businesses realize that their infrastructure was weak and not able to conform to the remote work environment. They were looking for alternatives. So we were getting a lot of inquiries from businesses that we had been courting, to fast track their implementation.",
            "And we also saw quite a bit of success with our promos that we ran. So we put out some really significant promotions for businesses to be able to adapt the cloud technology quickly and efficiently with very little out of pocket expenses."

            "Yes, thanks for taking my question. I think we have noted before the company was looking to potentially increase some marketing spend a little bit more as you continue to have this improving profitability trend. Can you talk a little bit about specifically what areas marketing you think with would give you potentially the best ROI? And is it fair to assume that you think that you can accelerate the company\u2019s like UCaaS service revenue growth above this kind of mid teens level if you reinvest a little bit more?"

            "Absolutely, Josh, thanks for the question. And so, obviously, we do feel like investing in our marketing efforts will help return a healthy return and help us get out of the teens and into the low 20s. And so we anticipate seeing more and more spend going through those marketing efforts, as you are well aware of those marketing efforts tend to take a little bit of time to begin.",
            "So currently with email campaigns, marketing campaigns, digital marketing spend, that is all going to take a little bit of time to bake in but we anticipate that will be money well spent, and with the messaging that we have got with a very structured messaging front with our new director of marketing.",
            "You will see that with changes to our website and see those changes to our presentation material will have a very consistent look and feel. So yes, we do feel like that increase in marketing spend will have a very positive return for us."

Are there any opportunities you mentioned in the second half where you think you start to scale that up? Or what would you think the biggest opportunities for the company is in the back half of this year?"

            "So we are trying to push that number higher, obviously since we have about 70% of our sales coming from our partner channel and actually a little bit of an increase in Q2 that we saw a nice spike with our partner channel sales. We anticipate that we will start seeing a little bit more of that.",
            "But again, our partners are working with their customer bases out there. And so as we see bigger customers coming on board with bigger clientele, we are starting to see some nicer size transaction. So I\u2019m encouraged by the funnel that we see out there for bigger transactions, and hope that we can start seeing that average size account push up."

I assume one or two that account for maybe a larger disproportionate percentage of revenue. And are there any big opportunities to continue to expand that partner channel that can accelerate your sales growth."

            "I think that we have a challenge that most sales organization tab with they get the high majority of their sales from the minority, their partners. And that is consistent with Crexendo. So I think we have, some very high performing partners that are very consistent.",

Maybe talk a little bit to seasonality. I know you haven\u2019t formally offered guidance for the year but it seems to me given the results you have posted. It shouldn\u2019t be too hard for you to offer some suggestions on what you think happens in the second half."

            "There is approximately 100,000 companies in the United States that are capable of selling our platform, and only about 250 of them are currently selling it. So, we have a lot of head space. And Doug, would you like to add anything?"

            "But from our perspective, the migration to cloud communications has always been very rapid over the last few years, and I anticipated that momentum will continue, as more and more businesses realize that their premise based platforms are unable to take them to the next level.",

So, maybe you could offer some insight on that as well. It didn\u2019t really talk about how that environment has changed. Right? I know. And Doug mentioned this in his prepared remarks that competitors haven\u2019t been unsuccessful. So, I was wondering if you could talk to maybe how the environment in partnerships and M&A has changed in light of other businesses struggling and not being, not driving a profit as you guys have?"

Now they are not going to increase as much probably, but a - percent or a 1% increase per quarter is possible because our fixed expenses are pretty known.

You have always said consistently through these calls that you would only consider acquisitions that are accretive. And in the past that has always seemed to me kind of an aspirational stance, because the currency that you had at the time was cash and cash was very tight at the company.",

I\u2019m not really sure I understand what is the gross margins is your 70% plus gross margins significantly above competitors? Is your accretiveness going to come from being able to buy creditors and make them more efficient? Is it going to come from taking small companies that you don\u2019t need any of their infrastructure and you can just onboard their clients?

We do that over in a two step process. We pay about anywhere from 40% to 60% up front, and then we adjust it for the amount of revenue over a period of six to 12 months.",

So if we think about the fact that 75% or 79% of our business from our Q2 came from our partners, if I have got a partner that is a data VAR or a managed service provider, and if they are average customers 10employees or 15 employees, that is going to be the target market they bring us into.",

Every second of every day, and frankly, we are more interested in growing the business than we are in determining who is a large shareholder and who isn\u2019t.",

And so our Crex-Connect is actually a collaboration tool, very similar to zoom. It is actually, just a quick side funny story that the founder of the person, we didn\u2019t actually build that in house, we white label that offering.",
            "And so the founder of the company that makes the product that we represent is one of the co-founders of WebEx, the other co founder of WebEx was the person that started zoom. So when WebEx was sold off to Cisco a few years ago, the two co-founders, both after their non-competes, expired, started up collaboration companies.",
            "One of zoom, and one of them is the partner that we have associated with, which is called Moxtra. And so we have been very pleased with our association with Moxtra, the Moxtra product is very similar to zoom.",
            "So for most of our customers that are our Crexendo Clients, they use our collaboration tool to remotely video conference and communicate and collaborate and screen share, and file share with their customers and their employees all the time. So we have got a very robust offering there, that competes very nicely with zoom."

I don\u2019t have the exact numbers but I think they have got about 100 to 125 direct reps out there. And then they have got their agent in their partner channel with is also come on-board and has been extremely successful with us.",

I think that they had nice revenue growth but, again at the expense of losing more money than they anticipated. RingCentral had nice revenue growth, but continues to lose money.",
            "So, as I look at our competitors, I think that, you know, we feel like we are managing the ship extremely well, we had a little bit smaller percentage of growth than our competitors, but much more profitability. And so, we have always believed, and we have always had in the fact that we are going to grow, but we are going to grow profitably.",
            "And so we are reinvesting back into the business, but we are not spending, as I mentioned earlier, in the 60% to 70%, range sales and marketing expenses, it is hard to, it is hard to ever get to profitability with those kind of numbers. So, granted, they are growing their top line, but at the detriment to their bottom line.",
            "So, I think that we compare well, and a lot of the metrics that we have discussed, I think our churn rate is probably one of the lowest in the industry. And I think that our operating profits that we have today are probably one of the highest in the industry."

If you take 59 or RingCentral, specifically, their cash flowing a little bit, but they are losing on a GAAP basis.",
            "And from the standpoint of valuation, we are at about 40% or 45% of their value. So there is a lot more head space with Crexendo than any of those competitors. I don\u2019t know if you would like to add to that, Jeff or not, but and you also Doug."

      "96": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, I always Greg, that sometimes it takes just as long to sell a 300 phone opportunity as it does a 20 phone opportunity and vice versa. So, yes, the sales process is fairly similar in both environments. You find your needs and pain points in the business and then you recommend solutions and hope fully you have got a good ROI to help them move forward fairly quickly.",
            "The sales process really hasn\u2019t changed. I think if anything COVID is up the process because up until COVID, I think that businesses were looking at migrating to the cloud. Because they realized it was something that they needed to do, eventually. I think COVID is sped up that eventually to brand need to do something much quicker than I anticipated.",
            "So, yes, we talked to a lot of businesses, it is the communication solution is lacking, but it works well in a COVID environment for many businesses, that doesn\u2019t work. So before when everybody\u2019s still had all of their employees showing up at the office, even though their phone system may have been lacking in capabilities.",
            "It still did the functions they needed for day to day. Now that in many cases in our office 80% of our employees are still working remotely. So businesses are using premise based systems, they have got employees using personal cell phones using home phones and not having any consistency within their organization.",
            "I think the sales process has sped up a little bit. We are seeing businesses making quicker decisions. The larger businesses tend to actually make decisions quicker than the smaller businesses because larger businesses realize that they can\u2019t wait and they have got to reinvest to continue keeping their business running. Smaller businesses tend to have a lot of emotional decision making aspects that are harder to control.",
            "So I would say that, we tend to see the larger deals in our funnel, go through the funnel process, in actually a quicker timeframe than the smaller ones. But an average size transaction for us from the time we start talking to them to the time we hopefully get an agreement to move forward, typically about four weeks."
