         "Thank you, and welcome to today's conference call to review our fiscal 2020. First and foremost, we hope all of you are safe and healthy. Before I summarize the results for the quarter and the full year, I would like to give a brief overview of the Collectors Universe's business for any new listeners on today's call.",
         "Collectors Universe is a leading provider of value-added services and content to the collectibles market. We are authenticating great collectible coins, banknotes, trading cards, autographs and various types of memorabilia.",
         "We have two major business services, Professional Coin Grading Service or PCGS, and Professional Sports Authenticator or PSA. Since 1986 PCGS has examined and certified millions of U.S. and world coins, banknotes, metals and tokens.",
         "PCGS had a solid performance in the fourth quarter despite the pandemic. PSA is the world's largest trading card, autograph and memorabilia authentication and grading service. Since 1991 PSA has examined and certified millions of collectibles.",
         "As our fastest-growing segment, PSA set an all-time revenue record in the fourth quarter and has grown annually by about 26% since 2018. As of the end of fiscal 2020, Collectors Universe had certified more than 81 million total collectibles with over 5 million of those certified in just the past year.",
         "Let's move on to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results. While the COVID-19 crisis presented our company with a host of challenges, our team quickly adjusted to the current operating environment and we achieved record revenues for Q4 and fiscal 2020.",
         "Beginning with a complete shutdown at the start of Q4 and transitioning to a skeleton crew a few weeks later, we gradually ramped up capacity under the new safety guidelines and we're able to finish the fiscal year at a terrific run rate.",
         "As was the case during our last earnings call, context will be key as we move through the details of our Q4 performance. Collectors Universe finished Q4 with $20.5 million in service revenues, up 4% from last year despite the lost time at the beginning of the quarter due to the pandemic. As noted earlier, this performance represents an all-time revenue record for any quarter not just Q4.",
         "For the year, Collectors Universe finished with $78.9 million in service revenues, which was up from $72.5 million in fiscal 2019. The performances in 2019 and 2020 represent back-to-back record revenue years for the company.",
         "In addition to setting a new annual revenue record, Collectors Universe met and exceeded the 5 million collectible certified mark during the fiscal year for the first time in our history.",
         "Furthermore, our cash position increased from $22.2 million at the end of Q3 to $28.6 million at the end of Q4, the single quarter generations figure from ongoing operations of $6.4 million in Q4 also represented an all-time quarterly record for the company. Given the continued strength of our results and our ability to execute in these challenging times, we remain excited about our business prospects moving forward.",
         "Now, let's take a deeper look at the performance within each division. Our PCGS division finished at $10.2 million for the quarter, which was down slightly from $10.9 million or 6% year-over-year.",
         "PSA surpass last year's Q4 performance by $2 million, finishing at $9.6 million, and was up by 27% year-over-year. Even though the PCGS performance was solid overall in Q4, it is important to note that our coin business continues to deal with more pandemic related challenges than our trading card, autograph and memorabilia business.",
         "For example, the pandemic has resulted in the cancellation of numerous tradeshows and on-site grading events, restricted international travel and it has impacted some production of the U.S. meant.",
         "Traditionally, PCGS has been more dependent on these types of things than PSA. That said, we are adjusting to the new environment. Let's start with a look at PCGS domestic and how we are responding.",
         "In Q4, PCGS vintage was up 17% year-over-year, finishing at $3.6 million versus $3.1 million in fiscal 2019. Some of that gain was due to the lack of tradeshows in the quarter, as a portion of potential tradeshow submissions were re-routed to our offices.",
         "Coins of this nature still need to be certified with or without the presence of shows. And we have services available at our corporate office to accommodate them. As expected, all three major coin conventions scheduled in Q4 were canceled, including our own tradeshow in Long Beach California.",
         "So, while no industry events of this nature took place during the quarter, about $220,000 of show revenue was technically recorded by PCGS, primarily as a result of shipping coins left over from a show that occurred late in Q3. In response to the lack of tradeshows, PCGS has already begun to schedule smaller trading events to help, at least in part, fill that void.",
         "While some potential show submissions can be rerouted into our vintage service line, creating a safe meeting environment for dealers, auction houses and collectors can help create more coin trading activity. This can ultimately lead to more submissions for PCGS.",
         "Four such smaller events have been scheduled and are being hosted by PCGS in Q1. We are optimistic that the smaller events can be an important catalyst to safely bring together our customers and generate incremental revenue in the process.",
         "Turning to PCGS Bulk, we are pleased to report that this part of the business finished Q4 with $3.6 million in service revenues and was up 36% year-over-year. PCGS International on the other hand was another area impacted by COVID-19 in a more meaningful way than some other parts of our coin business.",
         "While PCGS China and Hong Kong finished with respectable performances versus the same quarter last year, combining for $1.7 million in service revenues compared to $1.9 million in fiscal 2019, the restrictions on travel prevented more submissions from being processed.",
         "As we detailed on our last earnings call, enabling our Shanghai office to become more independent will give us the ability to process more coins over time. This process has already begun. But the inability to send some of our top experts to China to handle higher value coins along with the cancellation of our loan on-site grading event did have a material impact.",
         "The good news along with the fact that we continue to move towards greater operational independence in China is that our Shanghai office backlog is the highest that has ever been. Although COVID-19 has created some short-term challenges for our team, we are very pleased with the progress that we are making in that market.",
         "Finally, the Paris office was virtually shutdown for the entire quarter, but it finished the quarter with slightly over $0.1 million in service revenues versus $0.4 million last year in Q4.",
         "Let's turn to PSA. As mentioned earlier, the PSA and PSA/DNA services set an all-time revenue record for the quarter and year. This includes record Q4 output for the division. We shipped over 715,000 total collectibles surpassing the prior Q4 record of about 680,000 items set in fiscal 2019.",
         "As a reminder, we achieve this despite losing working days associated with the COVID-19 shutdown and the challenge in ramping up operations in a safe and measured manner in the early part of the quarter.",
         "Returning to our overall business, gross profit margins were 60% for the quarter, which was up from 59% a year ago. Our operating income for Q4 after non-cash stock-based compensation and the impairment charge for the Long Beach Expo business was $3.5 million, compared to $4.5 million in the previous year.",
         "Net income was $2.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 or $0.29 per diluted share, which was down from $2.8 million and $0.31 per share in the prior year. We also returned $6.3 million to shareholders during fiscal 2020 in the form of our ongoing dividend.",
         "Now, let me turn it over to Joe Wallace for a more detailed review of our financial performance in Q4. Joe?",
         "Thanks Joe. Before we conclude, I would like to make a few comments about the close of Q4 and the outlook moving forward into our first quarter of the new fiscal year. While we ended the quarter with a record revenue performance, Q4 was very challenging for Collectors Universe as it was for so many companies coping with the current crisis.",
         "That said, our team did a remarkable job amidst all the uncertainty, and I would like to take this moment to publicly thank them and acknowledge the tremendous effort they put forth under very difficult circumstances.",
         "As we discussed during our last earnings call in May, the collectibles market has displayed incredible resiliency during the most challenging economic climate our country has faced in decades.",
         "The demand for collectibles has not only remain strong, but it has increased in some markets, reiterating the need for our PCGS and PSA services. As more businesses shift toward e-commerce strategies some as a direct result of this pandemic, the demand for the certifications we provide should increase.",
         "Certified items are more easily traded in the marketplace, and hence more liquid. We are confident that Collectors Universe will remain a critical resource to the asset classes and customers we serve.",
         "By the end of Q4 and as a direct result of the increased interest I just mentioned, our trading card submission backlog also rose to a record level. As a result, we have accelerated our on-boarding efforts substantially to better handle the demand for our services.",
         "There is no question that the need for social distancing has put pressure on the operation. In response, our team has reconfigured the relevant departments and introduce new shifts to help spread our employees out each day.",
         "In the short term, some efficiencies have been reduced. But the need for greater capacity is more important than ever. I'm proud of how our team has risen to these challenges. In addition to our focus on people and process within our operational revamp in the short term, our team believes technology can help with efficiency and accuracy in the long-term.",
         "In fact, we plan on introducing robotics into our process in the coming months for image recognition and capture. We have received our first prototype for testing and look forward to using the capability more widely. This represents our first major move into automation.",
         "We continue to believe that there are more opportunities to leverage technology to improve our operations. We remain focused on finding the best possible solutions for customers. Overall, our top priority has been and continues to be stabilizing and growing our core businesses in the current operating environment.",
         "While pandemic related challenges remain. We are eager to find new ways of expanding our business and driving better returns to our shareholders. We enter fiscal 2021 with a robust market for collectibles and we're excited about the opportunity in front of us.",
         "As a reminder, all our expectations are governed by several factors not in our control, such as the price of precious metals, the market for collectibles and the overall state of the economic climate primarily in the U.S. and the possibility of changing international trade policies worldwide.",
         "Thank you for joining us today. And I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Now I would like to open the call to any questions you may have."

      "Joseph Wallace": [
         "Yes. Thank you, Joe. I'll now give a brief overview of the financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Despite the COVID challenges that impacted our third and fourth quarter that Joe just discussed, the company announced strong results in the fourth quarter and for the year.",
         "In addition, as of June 30, 2020, we continue to have a very strong balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, the company generated record quarterly revenues of $20.5 million and operating income of $3.5 million, and net income of $2.6 million or $0.29 per share.",
         "This compared to quarterly revenues $19.8 million, operating income of $4.5 million and net income of $2.8 million or $0.31 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. In fiscal year of 2020, the company generated record annual revenues of $78.9 million, operating income of $14.1 million, and net income of $10.8 million or $1.19 per share.",
         "This compared to revenues of $72.5 million, operating income of $14.3 million and net income of $10.0 million or $1.11 per share in fiscal 2019. The operating results of this year's fourth quarter were impacted by higher G&A expenses and an impairment charge that we will discuss in more detail below.",
         "The total revenue increase of $0.7 million or 4% in the fourth quarter, and $6.4 million or 9% the year were driven by increases of $2.0 million in Q4 and $7.3 million for the year in the cards and autographs revenues, representing growth of 27% in both periods and record fourth quarter and fiscal year revenues for that business.",
         "Card and autographs has achieved quarter over quarter revenue growth in 39 of the last 40 quarters. Total coin revenues were down $0.7 million or 6% in the fourth quarter, but were substantially unchanged for the year. In China, coin revenues increased by $1.0 million or 24% for the year. And that revenue growth was generated in the first half of the year prior to COVID.",
         "Combined coins and cards and autographs represented about 95% of revenues for the year and reflects the continued importance of those two businesses to our overall financial performance.",
         "Cards and autographs finished the year with a record backlog and therefore we expect continued growth in that business as we continue to increase authentication and grading capacity.",
         "As discussed earlier, the coin business in the U.S. is facing some COVID related challenges. However, we are continuing our efforts to identify and take advantage of revenue opportunities in that business much like we did in the fourth quarter.",
         "With respect to our China coin operation, which ended the year with relatively high backlog. We are focus on making that business less reliant in U.S. personnel to offset the impact of the travel restriction between the U.S. and China.",
         "The gross profit margins were 60% and 57% of this year's fourth quarter and for the year, as compared to 59% and 58% in the same periods of last year. Overall, our gross profit margins were up slightly in each quarter of the year, except Q3, when we abruptly closed operations in March due to COVID, while continuing to pay all employees.",
         "The gross profit margin for the year also reflects the continuing buildup of capacity to address the record backlog in the cards and autographs business. As previously disclosed, there can be ongoing variability in the gross profit margin due to the mix of revenues and the seasonality of our business.",
         "On a quarterly basis during the three years ended June 2020, our gross profit margins varied between 53% at 62%. Our combined operating expenses including the impairment charge represented 42% and 39% of revenues in this year's fourth quarter and for the year, as compared to 36% and 39% of revenues in last year's fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.",
         "Selling and marketing expenses were 9% and 12% of revenues in this year's fourth quarter and for the year versus 13% and 14% of revenues in last year's fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The lower selling and marketing expenses in dollar terms primarily arose in the fourth quarter and reflective lower tradeshow and travel costs in the quarter due to COVID.",
         "More generally for the year, we incurred lower business development costs at our overseas coin operations, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses and our growing cards and autographs business.",
         "G&A expenses represented 31% and 27% of revenues in this year's fourth quarter and for the year, as compared to 23% and 24% in last year's fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The dollar increases in G&A expense of $1.9 million and $3.6 million in the current year periods, included higher pre-trial legal settlement expenses of $0.8 million and $1.0 million, and higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million and $0.6 million.",
         "The non-cash impairment charge of $0.5 million related to our Expos business, and reflects uncertainty as to the viability of that business due to COVID, which has result in the cancellation of shows, unexpected social distancing concerns that will limit the number of attendees and dealers at future shows.",
         "Resulting operating margins were 17% and 18% of revenues in this year's fourth quarter and for the year, as compared to 23% and 20% in the same period of last year. Collectively, the higher G&A expenses and the impairment charge discussed above, represented about 8% and 3% of revenues in the fourth quarter and for the year.",
         "Turning to our balance sheet. The company's cash position was $28.6 million at June 30 2020, as compared to $19.2 million at June 2019, and $22.2 million at March 31, 2020. Net cash generated for the year of $9.4 million, included cash generated from operating activities of $19.2 million, partially offset by $6.3 million of cash dividends paid to stockholders, $2.7 million used for capital expenditures and capitalized software costs, and $0.8 million used to pay down the company's term loan.",
         "Our cash dividend of $0.175 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 will be paid this upcoming Friday, August 28 to stockholders of record on August 14. In summary, our fourth quarter turned out better than expected as we ramped up our operation in May and June.",
         "And we finished Q4 with strong momentum primarily in the cards and autographs business. With the continued backlog in that business, we intent to build on that momentum as we enter fiscal year 2021.",
         "With that, I'd like to thank you for your attention. Joe?"
