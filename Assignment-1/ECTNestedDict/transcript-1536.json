      "Andy Mattes": [
         "Thank you, Bret, and thank you to everyone for joining our earnings call today. This was my first full quarter at Coherent, and as you can imagine I am still on a steep learning curve about our company, our customers, our product portfolio and our people.",
         "I had never imagined how much one can actually get done in a solely virtual world. And I must say, I am extremely excited to see how all our employees are actively embracing the new normal of either getting business done remotely or working in our labs and manufacturing sites by adhering to our strict, stay safe and healthy rules.",
         "I am pleased to report that both the number of active COVID cases as well as necessary quarantines in our workforce were diminumus. Under the leadership of our COVID Steering Committee we have been able to safely ramp up our manufacturing readiness from some 80% back in April to over 90% today.",
         "Looking at our topline, we were able to improve our revenues sequentially from last quarter although our book-to-bill ratio dropped below 1 as we saw the effects of COVID slowing demand in several markets.",
         "To add a little color, Q3 was the first quarter that was fully overshadowed by COVID with substantial headwinds as most of Europe and the U.S. were under shelter in place orders. This impact was seen much more on the booking side than on the revenue side. On average, our proposal activity level in Q3 was more than 10% below the previous quarter.",
         "The month of April marked the low point with proposal activity more than 40% below Q2 average. We are encouraged to see that post June and now July proposal activity, rebounded to levels north of the Q2 average.",
         "To be clear, when I say proposal, I am referring to quotes, RFQs, RSPs and similar activities. If we do not experience another shelter and place environments in the months to come, this should be an early sign of recovery that could manifest itself in our Q1 booking.",
         "Now let\u2019s take a closer look at our Market segment. Starting with microelectronics, as you know, this market is made up of three sub markets, left panel display, semiconductors and API. All three markets have been impacted by COVID-19, but they are our bright spot. In quarter flat panel display revenue was aided by increased line beam shipments destined for Chinese customers.",
         "Fab utilization by our customers was still down in Q3, and our corresponding service revenue was off for a second quarter in a row by more than 20% from our pre-COVID run rate. However, we experienced strong service bookings, which together with consistent reporting of higher fab utilization in July, bodes well for increased service revenues in the future.",
         "Reports of many new 5G and flexible OLED enabled smartphone launches in the next quarters gives us confidence that the recovery should be sustainable as these products are expected to drive an upgrade cycle.",
         "If you look at the microelectronics market more broadly, we continue to capture mind and market share in the laser list of technology for flexible OLED with our UVblade 750, which continues to outperform our solid state laser competitor.",
         "And we have one significant repeat ultrafast business in Korea related to flexible OLED cutting an ultra-thin glass for foldable phone. Semiconductor inspection remains a bright spot with a strong demand across all nodes driven by strength in cloud computing and data centers.",
         "Our fiscal Q3 saw a historic high demand. In advanced packaging and interconnect, we see 5G driving increased demand in smaller geometry and next generation PCBs, which are striving strength in our CO2 laser via drilling business. We are well positioned with China\u2019s leading equipment supplier, who appears to be taking share from the historical industry leader.",
         "With consumer spending and habits worldwide being impacted by COVID. We would expect to see a somewhat quicker recovery for mobile electronics compared to big ticket items, such as for example, cars. We therefore expect a faster recovery across microelectronics than we would for materials processing.",
         "Looking at Materials Processing, machine tool demand remains depressed, especially across Europe, and to a lesser extent the U.S. Bookings are down more than 25% from pre-COVID levels. This trend already started in the German automotive sector before the pandemic, but has been exacerbated by the impact of COVID.",
         "With our recently announced exit from the commodity kilowatt fiber laser business, we chose to have a more limited participation in the China materials processing market. However, we continue to see strength in non-metal applications, such as converting, medical device manufacturing, and speciality semiconductor marking.",
         "We expect a slow recovery in the overall European and U.S. marking, welding and cutting markets, given the big ticket nature of the sector, but we are using the opportunity to retune and invest in our industrial systems and components sales organization ahead of some key new product launches, which we believe will position us for share gains, even in a relatively flat market in our upcoming fiscal year.",
         "Our OEM components and instrumentation business is made up of three important sub markets, life science instrumentation, medical diagnostics and therapeutics, and defense. Life science is down more than 15% from pre-COVID run rates, as many non COVID related research labs have been closed. This was partially offset with reasonably robust demand for clinical applications.",
         "In the last few weeks, we\u2019ve seen some upturn in sales activity, which feels like the beginning of a recovery. But we need another month or two to verify if this is truly the case. In medical therapeutics, we definitely experienced an upturn in phase activity, as pent up demand for mainly elective procedures starts to rise.",
         "Similarly, we see many research sciences now returning to their labs, and the proposal pipeline for sales and ultra-fast laser research and ground based astronomy looks robust after a very weak Q3 when few labs were open.",
         "As part of the OEM components and instrumentation end market, defense is emerging as an attractive sub market for us, where we are very well positioned in amplifiers for directed energy, counter measures as well as speciality optics for aerospace, and continue to see strong bookings. We see this as a multi-year growth opportunity and will expand further on our plans in this market in future calls.",
         "Early in the pandemic, we recognized the need to enhance our go-to-market approach, as the world around us is changing at an unprecedented pace. As announced yesterday, it was therefore, that for the first time in our history, we added the position of a Chief Marketing Officer to the executive staff. With David Gee, I\u2019m excited to welcome a digital marketing expert to Coherent.",
         "Up-scaling our leaderships builds on multiple level is one part of our good to great initiative that we launched in Q3. Operational Excellence, increased efficiencies and best practice sharing across all parts of our global organization is another important pillar of our good-to-great transformation. It is therefore, that I asked Mark Sobey, our Chief Operating Officer to oversee both our ILS and OLS business unit.",
         "One area that clearly underlines the fact that operational excellence is a team sport, and requires on-going and continuous improvement on all levels of an organization is cash generation. I\u2019m therefore definitely very excited to report that as a company, our focus on cash is starting to manifest itself in a noticeable improvement of our cash position from Q2 to Q3.",
         "And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin."

      "Bret DiMarco": [
         "Thank you, Danielle, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call to discuss Coherent\u2019s results from its third fiscal quarter ended July 04, 2020. All of us here at Coherent hope that you and your family are staying healthy and safe during these challenging times.",
         "On the call with me are Andy Mattes, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Palatnik, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.",
         "I would like to remind everyone that some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements about Coherent\u2019s future events, anticipated financial results, business trends, global economic trends and the expected timing and benefits, if any, of such trends.",
         "These forward-looking statements may contain such words as project, outlook, future, expects, will, anticipates, believes, intends or referred to as guidance. These forward-looking statements reflect beliefs, estimates, and predictions as of today, and Coherent expressly assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.",
         "These forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to substantial risks. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to risks associated with the recovery of global and regional economies from the negative effects of COVID-19 and related private and public sector measures, global demand, acceptance and adoption of our products, included but not limited to adoption of OLED displays, the demand for and use of our products in commercial applications, continued timely availability of products and materials from our suppliers, our ability to timely ship our products and our customers\u2019 ability to accept such shipments, worldwide government economic policies, including trade relations between the United States and China, and other risks identified in the Company\u2019s SEC filings.",
         "For a detailed description of risks and uncertainties which could impact these forward-looking statements, you should review Coherent\u2019s periodic SEC filings including its most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Forms 8-K, including the risks identified in today\u2019s financial press release.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Andy Mattes, our President and Chief Executive Officer."
      ],
      "Kevin Palatnik": [
         "Thanks, Andy. Today I\u2019ll first summarize fiscal third quarter 2020 financial results then move to the outlook for fiscal Q4. I\u2019ll discuss primarily non-GAAP financial results and ask that you refer to today\u2019s press release for detailed description of our GAAP results, as well as reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.",
         "The non GAAP adjustments related to stock based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, related tax adjustments and tax adjustments for stock based compensation. The full text of today\u2019s prepared remarks and trended GAAP and non-GAAP supplemental financial information will be posted on the Coherent Investor Relations website. A replay of this webcast will also be made available for approximately 90 days following the call.",
         "Fiscal third quarter 2020 financial results for the Company\u2019s key operating metrics were total revenue of $298.3 million, non GAAP gross margin of 33.1%, non-GAAP operating margin of 5.9%, adjusted EBITDA of 9.6% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.52.",
         "Total revenue for the fiscal third quarter was $298.3 million and came in at the high end of our previously guarded range. Although we were high in the range, sales were negatively affected by COVID-19. We estimate the impact to revenues was approximately $9 million to $10 million during the quarter.",
         "Our revenue mix by market for Q3 was microelectronics 48%, materials processing 27%, OEM components and instrumentation 18%, and scientific and government 7%. Geographically, Asia accounted for 54% of revenues in the fiscal third quarter, the U.S. 22% Europe 19% and rest of the world 5%.",
         "Asia includes two territories with revenues greater than 10% sales. We had one customer in South Korea related to large flat panel display manufacturing that contributed more than 10% of our fiscal for the quarter revenues.",
         "Revenue from other product and service for the fiscal third quarter was $97 million or approximately 33% of sales. Other product revenue consists of spare parts, related accessories and other consumable products and was approximately 28% of sales. Revenue from services and service agreements was approximately 5% of sales.",
         "Total service revenues were virtually flat sequentially, with a bit of a rebound and display offset by decreases in materials processing. Fiscal third quarter non-GAAP gross profit excluding stock based compensation costs, intangibles amortization restructuring, was approximately $99 million.",
         "Non-GAAP gross margin was 33.1% for Q3 and came in above the midpoint of our previously guided range due primarily to a stronger mix of our ELA tools partially offset by higher manufacturing costs related to lower volumes.",
         "Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased by approximately $1 million. This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 5.9% for the fiscal third quarter and came in above our previously guided range.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA was 9.6% in fiscal Q3. Turning to the balance sheet, non-restricted cash, cash equivalents of short term investments were approximately $421 million at the end of fiscal Q3, an increase of approximately $52 million compared to the end of last quarter.",
         "Given our focus on cash preservation during this continued period of relative uncertainty in the global economy, we did not repurchase any shares in Q3 pursuant to our current buyback authorization. We also did not make any voluntary payments against our term loan at the end of fiscal Q3. The outstanding amount of the term loan in USD was approximately $406 million.",
         "Accounts receivable DSO was 60 days compared to 62 days in prior quarter. And that inventory balance at the end of the fiscal third quarter was approximately $449 million, a decrease of $8 million resulting from our continued focus on optimizing our inventory balances and increasing our churns.",
         "Now I\u2019ll turn to our outlook for our first fourth fiscal quarter of 2020. Revenue for fiscal Q4 is expected to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million. You\u2019ll note that we tightened the guided range as a result of our improved visibility in certain end markets. We expect fiscal Q4 non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 34.5% to 38.5%.",
         "Non-GAAP gross margin excludes intangible amortization of approximately $2.3 million and stock compensation costs estimated at $1.2 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal Q4 is expected to be in the range of 6.5% to 10.5%. This excludes intangibles amortization estimated at a total of $2.9 million and stock compensation expense to a total of approximately $13.2 million.",
         "Other income and expense is estimated to be an expense in the range of $4 million to $5 million. We do not include transaction gains and losses related to future changes in foreign exchange rates in our OI&E outlook.",
         "We expect our fiscal Q4 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%. And finally, we\u2019re assuming weighted average outstanding shares approximately 24.3 million for the fiscal fourth quarter.",
         "I\u2019ll now turn the call back to the operator Danielle for a Q&A session."

            "Thank you. Good afternoon. I suppose, I heard you correctly. I think you said the book-to-bill was below one for the quarter and in some of which clearly I guess is the result of COVID. But I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about how the book-to-bill might have varied from different sectors. For instance, is there any color you can give us on the activity in the display market, where there\u2019s clearly some build out, but there\u2019s also some puts and takes about things being pushed to the right?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Hey, Jim it\u2019s Kevin. So listen, we did say that book-to-bill was less than 1, it was pretty much across the board against all of our end markets, microelectronics, materials processing, etc. We haven\u2019t called out display specifically in a couple of years in terms of bookings or book-to-bill or even backlog. We do that once a year after the K.",
            "So let me just say that across the board, we were less than 1, there were some bright spots as you heard in Andy\u2019s prepared remarks, the trends was strong, some biomedical stuff was strong, materials processing generally was weak, very weak and let me leave it there."

         "Remarks": [
            "Now. That\u2019s helpful, Kevin. I appreciate that. And just with respect to the display business. The service business, the question I have is, you called out utilization and clearly that\u2019s a factor, but if we look at the overall service business, is there anything else going on within that display related service business that potentially suggests that maybe, customers are finding a way to utilize the lasers more efficiently, where we\u2019re not seeing this kind of recurring revenue that maybe we would have thought otherwise?"

         "Speaker": "Jim Ricchiuti"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Jim, it\u2019s a very, very, very small factor. There are always improvements in process, that they yield a little bit more, what we call flashes for the tubes. But frankly, it co-relates much, much stronger to utilization. And if we look back in time, to the April, May timeframe, frankly utilization was down, we have seen it pick up in the last month or so, as you know, companies start to gear up for the fall set of phones and the early spring set of phones by two of the major handset manufacturers. So as we look forward, we do expect a bit of a rebound of display. As I mentioned that we saw a little bit in the current quarter, it was more than offset by materials processing. But as we look ahead, services should be on the rebound path."

         "Speaker": "Kevin Palatnik"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. And last question from me, I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Andy, when you joined, you talked about -- and it was early days when you first joined, but you talk to that in broad terms. Focusing on markets where do you think you have the potential to be either number 1, number 2? And I wonder if you could talk a little bit about if you can add a little bit more to that narrative, that discussion about how you see the portfolio possibly evolving?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Jim Ricchiuti"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Right. If you also recall, we said we would give more color on that at the -- after the close of the fiscal. But just kind of where we are and what we\u2019re -- where the wind is blowing right now. I mean, it\u2019s clearly for some of the key markets. And it\u2019s definitely displays that\u2019s, that\u2019s OLED and whatever other next generation displays there are on the horizon, that the whole laser lift off market. Semi is a very strong place for us. On the Scientific is a strong market for us to go. On the materials processing, we\u2019re going to be and the devices we\u2019re going to be very focused. We like we like medical and life science. So we will put, pick markets where we have a very strong standing. We like marking, especially speciality marking, and then we like a lot of the non-metal cutting and handling businesses.",
            "And then as we said early on the call in our prepared remarks, defense is starting to show up on our radar screen as a truly attractive opportunity for many years to come. But you got to give me a few more weeks to work through that before we can squawk a little bit more about that."

I just wanted to look at the September quarter, obviously, you thought there was about a 30 million headwind from COVID coming into June, and it only impacted you. I think you said 9 million. And looking at September, you\u2019re seeing some sequential growth at the midpoint.",
            "But can you talk about the different levers that are getting you to that growth? Clearly, if you take the lower base, you need some high sequential to get there, but with the better numbers. You know what came in a little bit weaker into September what\u2019s improving to get you to that midpoint of 305?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Tom, its Kevin. Yes, so you\u2019re right. At the midpoint, call it 305 up 7 million or so. And for 7 million, it\u2019s a myriad of things within the business. Suffice to say we\u2019re still a bit cautious as we look forward. There\u2019s been a lot of talk in California about potential shutdowns, with The Resurgence and such, and that may spread across the U.S. So, we believe the guide reflects some of that uncertainty. But for the 7 million increase to the midpoint, it\u2019s a myriad of small things."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay and then. And then my follow-up is just in the materials processing business, you walked away from some commodity business and you described some moving parts in the preamble, particularly the strength in non-metal applications. But that segment really isn\u2019t down as much as I would expect. Can you talk about what\u2019s doing better there? And if you\u2019re walking away from a couple of million dollars, you clearly need to see something more than offset, is it just the non-metal applications, are you seeing any last time buyers from customers that are walking away or is that a lot of the -- of the run rate now?"

Frankly, there wasn\u2019t I\u2019d say any strength in that sector at all. We talked about last quarter -- during the call that I expected materials processing to be in the low 80s and we came in at 81 and change. I think we\u2019re nearing a trough at least that\u2019s my perspective at this point.",

And I want to use the microelectronics to ask a question. It was double-digit, perhaps the supply chain disruption were behind you, so you are able to show double-digit growth in the sequential basis. But perhaps lack of face-to-face interaction may have pushed out some additional booking from June into September. Is that the way we should think about the dynamics or is it something else that you can elaborate on? And I have a follow-up."

Again from a myriad of items, not the least of which is new executive management, if you will. So if you work the numbers, you\u2019ll see a mid 80s OpEx on a non-GAAP basis and I think that\u2019s a pretty good number going forward."

I think Andy highlighted in Q1 of next year and I guess that\u2019s just sort of directly correlated with the rise in proposals.

You\u2019re looking at a 4 months to 6 months from quote to contract type of cycle. We see that many companies are trying to preserve their cash and are super prudent on their CapEx spending. So right now, they will probably air to be on the side of the longer sales cycles, then again, if demand flips these things can also flip relatively fast.

We\u2019ve got backlog for the September quarter and such and we are showing an increase in revenue right, sequentially, but all the newer sales activity that we\u2019re starting to see and starting to grow will benefit from that in the Q1 or the December quarter."

And I know you guys have been talking that your supply chain partners have been lowering their inventory on hand and I thought that that had reached a trough.",

This isn\u2019t the numbers that I shared, but behind the $97 million, I talked about for those other services, display was up sequentially and that was completely offset by the other areas, primarily in materials processing. As we look forward and as I mentioned earlier, as some of our customers in the Panel business ramp up to supply the fall set of phones and the spring set of phones of 2021, utilization should grow and therefore, our services should rebound a bit as well."

I\u2019m thinking, we can get back to those levels once the true OLED ramp hits. It won\u2019t be linear, it may be a little lumpy, but we can get back to nearly those levels going forward."

I think we spoke previously about 5G being a tailwind for many businesses, but including the AIP business related to PCB interconnects. I think, Andy, you mentioned that you\u2019re starting to see some up -- increasing activity. How should we think about the ramp up of those orders and then sales as we expect 5G smartphones eventually will become, about 40% of mix by some third parties in next year."

So net-net, the more 5G, the more tailwind or the usage of our technology.",

All of that\u2019s done virtually and it\u2019s often difficult, we have two different languages to communicate, but we do see -- as we look forward we do see orders in the upcoming quarters based on the ramp."

So if you look at the -- on the display side that business is going very strong and China is a big opportunity and we don\u2019t see any impact there, but we got out of the kilowatt fiber business. So the headwinds that we saw there and the race to the bottom on the pricing side, that was one of the main reason why we took the decision that we took a few months ago to exit that business.",

We see a continuous increase in interest in arm laser technology, which is very unique in the way that we can bundle the laser light in the ring and inside of the laser and it bodes extremely well. If you need to work with complicated metals like aluminum or copper, which both are very important when you talk about EV and you talk about that -- bringing electricity to the Powertrain and all that good stuff.",
            "So we think it\u2019s an attractive market, but if you run it through your model, we also want to be realistic; it\u2019s still an emerging market. Once you see the big auto companies shifting more of their production into electric vehicles, you\u2019ll see that market ramping, but you\u2019re talking years here, this is not something that\u2019s going to swing the pendulum overnight. But we\u2019re at the forefront of it and we\u2019re starting to become constructive about this segment."
