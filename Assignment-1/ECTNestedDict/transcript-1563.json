         "Thank you, Eyal, and good morning, everyone. In this quarter, we maintained revenue growth and together with healthy gross margins, as well as reduction in operational expenses mainly due to COVID-19, and as a result improved our bottom-line. ",
         "Now, please turn to Slide 3 for our financial highlights. To help you understand the results, I will be referring mainly to non-GAAP numbers, which exclude share-based compensation. We ended the second quarter of 2020 with revenue of $9.2 million, an increase from $8.5 million in the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Our gross margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was 77% in the second quarter of 2020. We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to be at the similar level as previous year. Please note that our gross margin can fluctuate depending on with the product mix. Our gross R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2020 on a non-GAAP basis were $4.5 million, a slight increase of $100,000 compared to the second quarter of 2019. ",
         "During the quarter, we received grants from the Israel Innovation Authority for the first half of 2020 for $572,000. Sales and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were $2.2 million on a non-GAAP basis, compared to $2.4 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease is mainly related to reduction in travel expenses due to COVID-19. ",
         "G&A expenses for the second quarter of 2020, on a non-GAAP basis were $804,000, compared to $754,000 in the second quarter of 2019. Operating income on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2020 was $102,000, compared to an operating loss of $715,000 for the second quarter of 2019.",
         "On a GAAP basis, as you can see on Slide 5, our net loss for the second quarter for 2020 was $200,000 or a net loss of $0.01 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $900,000 or [Technical Difficulty] - diluted share for the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Net income for the second quarter of 2020 on a non-GAAP basis was $200,000 or net income of $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $400,000 or a net loss of $0.03 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2019. At the end of the second quarter, our headcount was 273.",
         "Turning to the balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 9, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits at the end of the second quarter of 2020 was $66 million. We believe that our strong balance sheet provides us with the ability to execute the opportunities ahead of us and exhaust the ongoing global uncertainty.",
         "That ends our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

         "Thank you operator, and thank you all for joining us today. Earlier this morning we issued a press release, stating our second quarter results for 2020. We are pleased with our second quarter financial performance, which was in line with our full year growth plans as we increased revenue, continuing to invest in R&D and improved our bottom-line. ",
         "As you may have seen, total revenue for the third quarter of 2020 were $2.2 million and we remained on track to achieve our growth plans for 2020. Based on the current industry conditions and our visibility, we are reaffirming our full year 2020 revenue guidance range of $35 million to $38 million. ",
         "As such a full impact of COVID-19 is still as uncertain, we remain confident that the telecom industry will continue to grow resilient through this pandemic as people rely on telcos to keep business connected and families entertain in the era of social distancing and lockdowns. ",
         "We expect that 5G will continue to incrementally ramp up in the later part of 2020 and during 2021. We view this operator transformation as a key opportunity for RADCOM that we are well-positioned to take advantage of, as the market evolves. ",
         "At the beginning of August, there were already 92 commercial 5G networks worldwide. We see deployments progress and the telecom industry move forward despite the challenges of COVID-19. In the U.S., AT&T recently announced that its 5G network was available nationwide, which is powered by its network cloud, enabling cost savings and innovation and speed. We continue to have healthy relationship with AT&T as we deliver cutting-edge software releases and provide support for the evolution of their cloud network. ",
         "In Japan, Rakuten launched full commercial 4G services in April and already announced that they plan to launch 5G next month. Rakuten is moving fast with its cloud platform, which is already been packaged to sell other operators and enterprises in Japan and worldwide.",
         "Network transformations are multi-stage process and we are currently at the early stage where operators have selected their network equipment providers. Some operators are starting to move to the next step and roll out services. Still, once operators begin to deploy advanced used cases over 5G, assurance vendors will be evaluated and then selected. ",
         "In these 5G networks, operators will need to upgrade their existing service assurance solutions to cloud-native solutions as they will require proactive, real-time insights and dynamic solutions. We are starting to see initial customer requirement requests for next-generation capabilities and cloud-native features, as operators begin to plan for assurance vendor selection. ",
         "We are excited to have announced the launch of RADCOM ACE last week, our new automated assurance solution for 5G. This announcement is a significant milestone in our multi-year journey that started with the transition to virtualization. ",
         "I am proud of the team\u2019s accomplishment in reaching this critical milestone that position us well as the leading assurance solution for 5G. RADCOM AACE is the outcome of our product vision to provide operators with the automated assurance solution for 5G. ",
         "RADCOM\u2019s innovation software will automatically monitor the operators\u2019 services, pinpoint critical issues and help resolve them. Adhering to new paradigm for assurance capabilities, RADCOM ACE will help operators accelerate their network transformations by continually monitor the customer experience and provide tools to rapidly optimize the network to ensure smooth migration for the operators\u2019 customers to 5G. ",
         "Combining cloud-native technologies, with cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver real-time network intelligence, RADCOM ACE significantly reduces the total cost of ownership for assurance. ",
         "This is provided by creating expense savings for operators through their automated optimization of their network, as well as decreased CapEx requirements through our containerized software efficiency and cloud-native capabilities. ",
         "In bringing RADCOM ACE to the market, we took advantage of our use of cloud-native expertise, as well as our close working relationship with some of the leading telecom operators in the industry today to design a solution for 5G and the advanced use case of the future. \\",
         "Currently, we are involved in multiple 5G opportunities and trials at selected customers. We believe that RADCOM ACE answers the needs of operators for automated assurance solutions and are ready to deliver RADCOM ACE to operators as they move forward with their assurance investments. ",
         "We are pleased with our second quarter performance as we continue to execute on our plans, and invest in R&D to support our customers\u2019 needs. The transformation to 5G is a key opportunity for RADCOM that we are well-positioned to take advantage of, as more and more operators make their transition. Given our engagement with industry-leading customers on cutting-edge projects that utilize our cloud-native solutions, we are in a strong position to benefit from this network transformation. ",
         "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Amir Hai, our CFO, who will discuss the financial results in details. Amir, please go ahead. "

So, as we look at that, the question comes up \u2013 kind of please, two questions related, one, does it change the timeline for evaluations from potential customers, because they are now looking at a different architecture than what they had been looking at before? ",

I think it\u2019s definitely an exciting time for us and we are very pleased with this critical milestone of launching the RADCOM ACE, which a very advanced cloud-native containerized architecture product. This is an outcome of hard work of multiple years and it\u2019s part of our long-term strategy to focus on the 5G market and its needs. ",
            "It\u2019s aligned with our plans in a way that we talked in the previous calls that 5G is about to start \u2013 I mean, in the service assurance space, second part of 2020 and primarily in 2021while the market is expecting to get to peak in 2022, 2023. So, I think it\u2019s a great timing. We are now in a - really early adaptive stage. ",
            "When we start to see the first operators globally announcing they are moving to the next stage with their 5G networks and starting to impacting their 5G core, which is exactly the indication that this is followed by investments on a service assurance solution. ",
            "While you are going through those 5G implementation in the \u2013 including the 5G core, and building it on the cloud-native technology which a consensus every day. You will not be longer be able to use the previous architectures. ",
            "You need something new that is containerized, that is built to the 5G requirements and this is why we were building the last few years to make sure we are ready on time and we are very pleased that we meet this milestone. ",
            "Now about your question in terms of the timing of the investment, I think this is in line with the operators\u2019 readiness on selections of tools. I would say that, from initial trials we were doing and we just launched this last week, so \u2013 but we already introduced these technologies to some of our selective customers. And the feedback is very exciting. So, we believe that it\u2019s going to be in line with the plan. Some operators are still looking on 4G and still looking on virtualization technology of the current stage I would say, but the early adopters of 5G are moving already to this cloud-native architecture. So, I think both solution and I would say, this complements our current stack and allow operators to have end-to-end visibility into its 4G and 5G network whether using the software or up to the cloud-native latest and greatest architecture that operators are adopting today.

We were waiting for the virtualization technology to start pick up pace and we are very excited that in 5G, everything is going to be virtualized. ",

As mentioned, 92 carriers already announced the \u2013 are starting to launch initial 5G implementations. We are seeing that despite COVID-19, the transformation to 5G continues. ",

Rakuten obviously launched in the 4G network in April, you mentioned, you expect to launch 5G next month. Any \u2013 so, in terms of what that contract looks like as we move to 5G that tail into revenue for you that customers that should we expect that to increase your revenue opportunity to that customer?

And they are part of our target audience for this RADCOM ACE. And I think this is really where our technology advantage would come to play. We obviously used a lot of the inputs of our existing customers in order to build and design our new 5G solution. ",
            "And we are exciting to have it launched and start to work with both, again, new customers and our existing customers moving forward into implementation of these technologies in their network. I still want to reiterate that while we see operators announce their 5G and 5G investments and some even nationwide, most of them are still in a very early stage in their 5G investment, primarily focused on the radio side. ",
            "And just I think this was a that we saw first announcement of selecting the vendors for their 5G core, which is the main driver for investment in assurance. So we are seeing progress, but we need to understand where are we in the timeline. And we are now moving through the next step. But there is still time until we would see implementations of service assurance solutions in 5G. It\u2019s \u2013 as I indicated, it\u2019s expected to happen late in 2020, primarily 2021. "

            "So, I think that RADCOM as of today is still has a lot of potential of growth within the markets. We are looking on the telecom industry and there are very few to none selections of 5G assurance providers worldwide. So, the market opportunity is ahead of us. But as we know, telecom industries and selection process and new technology adoption takes time and it\u2019s not something that everything will happen over the next few quarters. ",

I believe that we have great opportunity both with our existing customers, and with potential new customers. The rate of adoption is really dependent on the selection process of the different operators and it\u2019s very hard to predict. ",
            "But the advantage of RADCOM is that, every new win and every new expansion could be a very significant upside on our revenue numbers. So, it\u2019s still something that we are monitoring and anticipating and once we get closer to the end of 2020, we are expecting to a better visibility into 2021 and we would share our guidance then.

So, overall, we are seeing positive progress towards the plan is aligned with what we expected to happen when we planned 2020. ",

So, if you launch your radio, if you launch your 5G, as I mentioned, if you invest, most operators start with investing only on the radio side and they still use their 4G network core in order to support this new ideal connection. This is the stage we are as an industry. But once we move to the next stage of 5G, after the initial launch and want to grow more strategically with that, they need to upgrade their network core. ",
            "In this stage, most of the carriers - very big vast majority of the carrier will select a solution of service assurance in order to assure that they get visibility, otherwise, they are transparent to what\u2019s going in the network and it will be very hard to support the launch \u2013 very hard to maintain the customer experience.
