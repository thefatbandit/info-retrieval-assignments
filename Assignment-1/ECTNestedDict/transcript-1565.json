         "Okay. Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and welcome to ITW\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. I'm joined by our; Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW\u2019s second quarter 2020 financial results and provide an update on our strategy for managing through the global pandemic.",
         "Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Company's 2019 Form 10-K, and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risk that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.",
         "Please turn to Slide 3. And it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.",
         "Okay, thank you, Scott. Julianne, let's open up the lines for questions."
      ],
      "Michael Larsen": [
         "Okay. Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s turned to Slide 5. As Scott mentioned, priority number 3 for managing through the pandemic is to maintain ITW\u2019s considerable financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality. In the second quarter we did just that. And going forward, we will continue to live on that priority. As we leverage our strong financial foundation and resilient profitability profile to position ITW for maximum participation in the recovery.",
         "On our last earnings call, we shared our expectation for an unprecedented level of demand contraction to the complete shutdown of wide swaths of the global economy. And indeed, organic revenues declined an unprecedented 27%. As expected, automotive OEM and food equipment were the hardest hit segments. Other segments fared much better, providing another proof point for the benefit of ITW\u2019s diversified high quality business portfolio.",
         "At the enterprise level, total revenues declined 29% as organic revenues declined 27% in foreign currency, and last year's divestitures further reduced revenues by about a point each. Nevertheless, our businesses still generated $449 million of operating income and delivered resilient operating margin performance of 17.5% with operating expenses down more than $140 million and enterprise initiatives contributing 100 basis point.",
         "As expected, free cash flow was strong at $681 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year and 213% of net income. Q2 cash flow performance did benefit from the delayed timing of U.S. income tax payments of $158 million, which were paid in the third quarter.",
         "Our divisions stepped up to their credit monitoring and collection efforts early in the quarter. And as a result, our receivable performance has continued to remain in line with historical norms. The balance sheet, and our liquidity remained strong throughout the containment phase as we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash on hand, essentially no short-term debt, no commercial paper, a $2.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, Tier 1 credit ratings and total liquidity of more than $4.3 billion.",
         "As expected, ITW had more than enough financial strength and resilience to withstand the shock to the system that the global economy experienced in Q2. We were prepared for it, we managed our way through it effectively. And today we're strongly positioned for the recovery.",
         "With that, please turn to Slide 6, for a retrospective look at second quarter revenue, starting with organic revenue by geography. As you can see, the demand contraction with global as North America declined 26%, Europe was down 37%, and Asia Pacific was down 7%. On a positive note, China was up 1% after being down 24% in Q1, as the early phase of their recovery began to take hold.",
         "On the right side of the slide, we're sharing average revenue per working day by month. As we move through the quarter, and we compared it to last year, you can see that April was the bottom and then we experienced a sequential acceleration in May. And in June, as the global economy began to reopen. This trend has continued in July.",
         "Now, let's go to Slide 7 for segment performance. And on the left side, you can see the most and least affected segments in terms of organic revenue and operating margin. For comparative purposes, I should point out that these margin numbers are fully-loaded on operating margins, not segment margins. It is also notable that five of seven segments delivered operating margins above 20%, despite organic revenue declines ranging from 9% to 25%, and the two segments overcame the significant negative volume leverage to actually expand operating margin year\u2013over-year.",
         "Turning to the right side of Slide 7. As expected, given that most of our automotive OEM customers in North America and Western Europe essentially shutdown in mid-March and only began to restart production in May, June. Our automotive OEM business was the hardest hit. Overall organic revenues were down 53% year-over-year, although we did see a significant uptick in June that is continuing in July. North America was down 62%, Europe down 59% and China was the bright spot with organic revenue up 6%.",
         "Importantly, as order production continues to ramp up in Q3, our local close to the customer manufacturing positions remain fully resourced and in position to continue to serve our customers every step of the way, and with the same world class quality and delivery that they have come to expect from us.",
         "Turning to Slide 8, also as expected the second hardest segment was food equipment, as organic revenue declined 38%. North America organic revenue was down 33% and international declined 44%. Equipment sales were down 38% and service was down 37%. Institutional sales including healthcare facilities and hospitals were slightly more resilient down about 30%. And not surprisingly, restaurants QSR were down about 45%. Relatively speaking, sales to grocery retail customers held up better, down only 14% with some equipment orders being pushed out due to COVID concerns and retail service sales were flat with prior year.",
         "Test & Measurement and Electronics, Organic revenue declined 11% with Test & Measurement down 12% and Electronics down 9%. While demand for CapEx Equipment dropped sales were up double-digits in end markets tied to semiconductor healthcare and clean room technology. And despite negative volume leverage, operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.7% with excellent cost management and enterprise initiatives as the main contributors.",
         "Turning to Slide 9. In Welding demand slowed significantly, as organic revenue declined by 25% with Equipment sales down 28% and Consumables down 21%. Industrial end markets declined 40% while commercial end markets were fairly resilient, down only 11%. That said despite a 29% of [higher] Revenues Q2 operating margin was 21.6%.",
         "Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue was down 14%. Polymers was down 20% in line with industrial and MRO trends. Auto aftermarket was down 14% with retail sales improving in a meaningful way as stores open back up as the quarter progressed. Fluids had the best performance with organic revenue down only 5% held by product sales into health and hygiene end markets. Operating margin was up 30 basis points to 23.1% driven by enterprise initiatives and strong tactical cost management.",
         "Moving to Slide 10, Construction, organic revenue was down 9% with North America which is almost half of the segment, up 1% with double-digit growth in the residential renovation market served through the home center channel. This strength was partially offset by a 21% decline in the North America commercial business and internationally as Europe was down 28%, reflecting a more restrictive quarantine protocol. Australia and New Zealand sales were down only 3%.",
         "Specialty organic revenue was down 16% with North America down 15% and the international side down 19%. Demand for consumables in our consumer packaging businesses such as Zip-Pak were up double-digits offset by orders for packaging equipment being pushed out and some lower sales into the appliance and aviation industry.",
         "So let's move to Slide 11 for an update on some full year 2020 performance scenarios. On our last call, we provided three financial scenarios to illustrate the fact that we have the financial strength and margin profile to withstand whatever comes our way over the near-term and therefore, our number 1 priority is positioning to play offense in the recovery.",
         "With Q2 in the books, we're updating these scenarios for a key operating metrics, organic revenue, operating margin and operating income. The caveats that will be discussed during our Q1 cost to apply i.e. this is the time of extraordinary and unprecedented uncertainty, and accepting any significant recurrence of major economic shutdowns.",
         "As you can see, we are narrowing the range of likely four year outcomes based on our second quarter performance and current demand trends across the company. And what stands out is that in all three scenarios, ITW\u2019s operating performance is strong in terms of operating income and operating margin.",
         "And while we're not providing formal guidance as we sit here today, we are tracking closest to the mid scenario. The second half organic revenue is down about 12%, which would translate into a full year organic decline of approximately 14.5% and operating margins of 20% to 22%.",
         "And in an unprecedented year like this, should this scenario hold, we would still make somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion of operating income and generate more than $1.8 billion in free cash flow.",
         "As demand recovers, we want to be in a strong position to fully support our customers as their businesses begin to re-accelerate. As a result, we expect an increase in working capital and therefore lower free cash flow of about $600 million in the second half of the year. Importantly, though, we're going to make sure that we're in a strong position to both respond to our customers needs, and take share from competitors who can throughout the recovery.",
         "As we discussed on the last call, we're going to make some fairly modest capacity and cost structure adjustments based on projects submitted by our division leaders who have now had a chance to better assess the pace and slope of recovery in each of their respective businesses. We currently projected that we will spend about $60 million in restructuring projects in the second half of the year, including $45 billion [indiscernible] to back projects that were already planned for 2020 that we placed on a temporary hold as the early stages of the pandemic unfolded.",
         "As a reference, we spent about $80 million on restructuring in 2019. And about $30 million of that was in the second half of the year. It is worth noting that the average payback for these projects is projected to be less than 12 months.",
         "Finally, just some a brief comments on capital allocation to let you know that our position has not changed from our last call. First with regard to the dividend we\u2019ve recognize the importance of our dividend to our long-term shareholders. We continue to view it as a critical component of ITW\u2019s total shareholder return model, and we remain strongly committed to the dividend.",
         "In terms of strategic optionality we are clearly in a position of strength with ample liquidity and balance sheet capacity and strong credit ratings. We remain open to the possibility that opportunities might emerge as a result of a pandemic and we're in a strong position to react to high quality strategic opportunities that are aligned with our enterprise strategy. Lastly, we suspended share repurchases until end market stabilized, and the recovery path becomes clearer.",
         "So let's move on to Slide 12. And I'll turn it back over to Scott to share some more thoughts on our recovery phase strategy. Scott, back to you."

         "Good morning. My name is Julianne, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For those participating in the Q&A, you'll have an opportunity to ask one question and if needed one follow-up question. Thank you.",
         "Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference."
      ],
      "Scott Santi": [
         "Thank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. Well, things are far from normal for any of us or our businesses at present. I\u2019m extremely proud of how the ITW team is managing through the unprecedented and challenging circumstances brought about by the pandemic. I want to begin by sincerely thanking my ITW colleagues around the world for the effort, dedication and selflessness that they continue to demonstrate daily and protecting the health and safety of their colleagues while continuing to serve our customers with excellence.",
         "As I have said many times, the power of the ITW business model and our decentralized entrepreneurial culture are never more valuable than during times of significant and rapid change. And we are leveraging both to position the company to participate across a wide range of recovery scenarios while continuing to execute our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITw\u2019s full potential performance.",
         "Over the last seven years, we have made significant progress and executing our strategy to take full advantage of our unique strengths to clearly established ITW as one of the world's best performing, highest quality and most respected industrial companies. And in doing so building a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and the resiliency necessary to deliver consistent upper tier performance in any economic environment.",
         "Well, needless to say the resilience component of that equation is now being tested in ways that were hard for many of us to even imagine six to seven months ago. And as evidenced by our second quarter results, this company in our team of over 45,000 dedicated professionals are rising to the challenge.",
         "In the second quarter, in the face of an unprecedented 29% decline in revenues, ITW delivered $449 million in operating income, $681 million in free cash flow, and operating margins of 17.5%. We leveraged our flexible cost structure to reduce operating expenses by more than $140 million without any centralized cause takeout mandate from corporate, while providing full compensation and benefit support to every ITW team member, sustaining investments and key long-term growth strategies, and positioning for full participation in the recovery.",
         "As we outlined during our first quarter earnings call, we have an integrated four prong strategy for managing the company through the pandemic. Protect and support our people continue to serve our customers with excellence, maintain our financial strength and strategic optionality and win the recovery. These four priorities comprised the central near-term planning and execution focus for the whole of ITW, and for every one of our operating divisions.",
         "We'll come back to them at the end of our presentation. But first let me turn the call over to Michael who will provide you with additional detail on our Q2 performance. Michael over to you.",
         "All right. Thank you, Michael. So moving forward, while significant end market disruption and uncertainties remain, we will continue to leverage our financial strength and the performance power of our business model to prioritize playing offense in the recovery over playing defense in the contraction, and to ensure that every one of our businesses is strongly positioned to fully participate in the recovery.",
         "Job one is to protect our people while continuing to serve our customers with the world class quality and delivery performance that they expect from us. Thus far, our people have done a superb job on both fronts and across the company. We will remain intensely focused on these two mission critical imperatives.",
         "Second, we're going to lean in hard to the upside by remaining invested in staff to support anticipated demand two to three quarters out, so that we have ample cushion to both fully support our customers as their businesses re-accelerate and to capture incremental share gain opportunities that we expect might emerge along the way.",
         "In that regard core to the recovery planning process in every one of our 84 divisions is the identification and actioning of specific pandemic related share game programs and opportunities that are aligned with our long-term enterprise strategy.",
         "Finally, we will leverage our advantaged financial position to sustain the investments we've made to support the execution of our enterprise strategy. We are taking the long view and from that perspective when the recovery is an execution component of our long-term enterprise strategy. It is not a separate strategy. It is about every one of our divisions identifying specific opportunities to aggressively accelerate progress in executing key aspects of their enterprise strategy agenda, due to the effects of the pandemic. Things such as newer changing customer needs, competitors, distress, ability to stay invested, et cetera.",
         "In fact, we're already seeing areas of opportunity emerging in our businesses. And these are some of the early themes. First, ITW\u2019s undisrupted ability to supply and deliver during these times of tremendous volatility and disruption is a significant asset. In the last quarter, we landed new programs worth a combined $105 million annually with a handful of key customers based largely on our ability to provide immediate supply.",
         "Second, many companies including many of our existing customers are moving away from low cost country sourcing strategies and looking to localize their supply chains in response to risk and challenges exposed first by trade and tariff related disruptions, and now by the effects of the pandemic. Our long standing commitment to local produce where we sell manufacturing has uniquely positioned ITW to support existing and new customers in making this transition.",
         "Just recently, one of our businesses was awarded nearly $10 million in new business a result of one of their key customers moving to build more local supply capability. In addition, a number of our automotive OEM customers are implementing strategies to localize their supply chains and we are in a very strong position to support them in this regard.",
         "And third, we are already benefiting from remaining committed to our strategic sales excellence and customer back innovation investments. Our ability to stay the course means that the people that we have invested in, in these critical areas remain in place and that they are not distracted by downsizings, reorganizations, top down mandates or shifting priorities. They remain focused on serving customers, seizing new opportunities, and continuing to innovate. It's just one illustration, in the second quarter our new patent filings were up 24% over the last year.",
         "So in closing, on behalf of Michael and our entire executive leadership team, we offer our deepest thanks to our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and dedication always, but especially during this period of unprecedented circumstances and challenges.",
         "Well, there is obviously a lot that we will have to work our way through in the months ahead. I have no doubt that the strength and resilience of ITW\u2019s business model, our diversified high quality business portfolio and our people position us extremely well to seize the opportunities and respond to the challenge that lie ahead.",
         "With that, I'll turn it back to you Karen."

         "Remarks": [
            "Scott and Mike, maybe you can help us color on business conditions by region a little more. And China turning positive is encouraging, as you said. But for many companies in Q2, we saw some improvement maybe a little faster in Europe, in the U.S., you guys were down a little bit more in Europe. So maybe you can talk about what held you down in Europe. And then you mentioned you were down about 20% in terms of average daily sales in June, and then you continue to see improvement in July. In terms of the reason to decline did you continue at the same rate of recovery as you saw by month, in Q2 in July?"

      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Hi, so let\u2019s start with your question on Europe, specifically, which represented 25% of our sales in the quarter and saw as you pointed out there most significant decline year-over-year at 37%. By far, the most significant decline was in the automotive business as you might expect down 59% followed by food equipment down 48% and then construction down 28%.",
            "In terms of the kind of the framework that we're providing for the second half year and your question around how the dynamics might play out by region, we're anticipating, again, in a very dynamic environment here, North America and Europe down both in that 10% to 15% range, year-over-year and then Asia Pacific and China as you pointed out better than that flat maybe slightly positive as we look at the second half year.",
            "A lot of \u2013 probably the thinking on how the second half plays out ties back to your first, the second question, which was around July and the trends, so. The trends that we saw, sequentially in the second quarter were certainly encouraging April, the bottom acceleration in May, June. And those trends have continued into July. I wouldn't read too much into one month year. I think this remains a really like I said, uncertain environment. And the best way to think about this is really this second half framework that we've provided as you look at how this might play out, but certainly encouraging kind of near-term demand trends that continued into Q2."

         "Remarks": [
            "Michae, just one follow up on how you thinking about forecasting auto OEM, obviously one of your tougher businesses but, relatively quicker recovery that we're seeing there. You mentioned the shutdowns impacting your business. But is it harder to adjust ITW\u2019s cost base in that business. And in the past, it's been hard to change move pricing around. So that what hurt you in the quarter? And do you expect that business would turn profitable again in Q3?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Andrew Kaplowitz"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, I think the short answer is no. I mean, I think, as you know, we're not an auto company, we're really benefiting in Q2 in the second half from this high quality, highly diversified portfolio. So we don't have to get the forecast 100% right in automotive, because we know we're going to have offsets, one positive or negative and other parts of the company where as you know, we're very much a read and react company. We don't have a lot of backlog. We don't have great visibility. Beyond, two to three weeks in auto for example, but we do have the ability to respond very quickly to changes in demand.",
            "We, expect a challenging second half in automotive certainly better than Q3. And then just did we transparent with -- what auto might look like in the second quarter based -- in the second half based on feedback from customers current demand trends, we're looking at being down about 15% in the second half of the year for automotive. Of course, a lot of that depends on how quickly production ramps up what auto sales do in the second half of the year, but maybe that gives you a sense for how that might play out."

         "Remarks": [
            "Due to [indiscernible] I would add on the cost side as we were very intentional and that decimating the business and this was the hardest shutdown across our portfolio. And we clearly knew that was going to take place production stops from mid-March through mid-May. And ultimately we made a choice not to do anything that would impair that we also expected that once that those hard shutdowns were over that things would recover. Maybe not certainly not back to their prior demand levels but a long way from zero, which is where they were for those 60 days or so. So I think there was a lot of intention in -- if your reference point is to the fact we lost money in that business that was, we certainly could have mitigated some of that if we wanted to worry about that. But ultimately, our decision and our biggest concern was making sure that we were there to support our customers on the other side of that."

So can you just talk about the margin trajectories as we think about the second half of the year in that business. And then I guess my follow up question just is sort of on the market share opportunity. Can you talk about sort of early conversations with customers, if you think you'll be able to gain market share? And is that embedded, as you think about sort of the sales outlook for the back half of the year? Thanks."

But even with that sort of kind of unprecedented decline, we expect that business to continue to be profitable. And we expect margins to continue to improve from where they were in Q2 and being back into double-digit territory here in Q3 and Q4."

So I think we -- that's, that's maybe how we think about the market share opportunities."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I think and I think the only thing I would add, Jamie, is it just in terms of impact on the balance of the year? We're not really that -- focused on that. We're looking for long-term opportunities that are sustainable ultimately the programs that I referenced will that have some incremental benefit in the back half, sure. But ultimately, we're not looking so I guess the point I'm trying to make is we're not looking for quick hits that are opportunistic. We're looking for opportunities to move faster on opportunities that we would want even in normal times, and expected certainly based on the second quarter, but certainly optimistic that those will continue to pop up as we move forward."

The other half of it, though, in terms of the $50 million -- the limited amount of incremental, that's pandemic related is goes back to what we said in the commentary, which is we're staying structured to support demand two to three quarters out. And we don't have any -- that's an advantage that we have given the margin cushion, given the cash flow profile. We expect the economy to revert to growth at some point, I can't tell you exactly when, but I think nobody's betting against the global economy long-term and we're going to stay, we're certainly not. And so $50 million is a response to the strategy that we've agreed on with all of our divisions, it says we're going to stay invested. And we're going to stay focused on making sure we can serve our customers and lean into growth as these businesses recover.

And that -- there's no I can try to think through the list. There's no competitor distress component to any of those.

But does that imply that when you get on the other side of this and you don't have a lot of these discretionary costs come back in other do you have that your incremental can be higher on recovery? Normally you have 35% plus and price savings. Does that look more like a 40% plus, plus EF going forward or mean any color that would be good as well?"

And again, we're not really focused on managing to a decremental margin number here in the near-term. I think is -- as we said, is much more around positioning for the long-term, but decrementals, kind of in the low 40s for the second half, a little bit higher than that in Q3 as a result of the restructuring and then in Q4 like we said on the last call, we expect to be back in kind of a more normal decremental margin in the 35% to 40% area.

I mean, I think clearly, we've seen a meaningful decline in the near-term here on the restaurants and the QSR side and we'll continue to stay close to it and we'll be there to support our customers every step of the way, including with the service side of things, which is a really important part of opening these restaurants back up again that really starts -- service call to make sure that all the equipment is operational and done what it's supposed to do for our customers.

And that's, again, we're taking a long-term view so that is dependant on where they are in terms their near-term relative distress.",

So, we would only act if we had an opportunity to add to one of our positions -- really differentiated products access to a new market, a new end market, a new geography, etcetera. So there has to be some long-term benefit, but I don't think we chide away from any. I wouldn't necessarily rate any sort of higher priority lower priority across the seven."
