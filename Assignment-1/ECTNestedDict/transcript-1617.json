      "Chris Ashton": [
         "Welcome and thank you for joining Worley\u2019s Full Year Results Presentation for the year ended 30 June 2020. The results presented today include for the first time the full twelve months of financials of Worley. But before we talk about the results, I\u2019d like to acknowledge the devastation COVID-19 has caused to communities around the world. We felt this through the loss of six of our colleagues to the virus and we hold their families and friends in our thoughts. ",
         "I'd like to thank each and every one of our people for their continued dedication to delivering outstanding outcomes for our customers or while managing through the rapidly changing global environment driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. These results have been achieved because of their agility and resilience that exemplifies the spirits of Worley. ",
         "Turning to Slide 2, I\u2019ll remind you to review our disclaimer shown here. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 3. In terms of the agenda today, I\u2019ll first start with an overview of the 2020 financial year results and then Tom will go through the detailed financials. I\u2019ll then provide an update on our transformation strategy and sector updates and close with some final remarks on our outlook. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 4. We are proud of the results delivered this year. Our aggregated revenue was up to $11.2 billion, up 75% from FY 2019 and up 7% on the FY 2019 pro forma due to the inclusion of the full year of ECR. We\u2019ve generated an underlying EBITA growth of 80% from FY 2019 demonstrating an improved underlying performance. ",
         "As a result of this performance, the Board has declared a dividend of $0.25 per share. I think the highlight of the year, particularly in the last six months is our improved financial strength. Our underlying operating cash flow was $881 million, up from $239 million in the prior financial year. Our leverage ratio continues to improve and it is 1.9 times and we renewed and established debt facility of a total of $945 million in April this year. ",
         "We\u2019ve delivered on the benefits of the ECR which is ahead of the expectations. Our business is more diversified with contribution from chemicals, almost doubling from last year and now providing 40% of our revenue. We\u2019ve exceeded the previously announced cost synergy target having delivered $177 million of annual savings and today, we are now seeing the raised target of $190 million runrate.",
         "As we announced in June, we\u2019ve accelerated our transformation to emerge stronger from the disruptive period we faced. We delivered $165 million with a runrate of operating savings today with a total of $275 million of runrate savings to be delivered by December 2021. This is in addition to our ECR cost synergies. ",
         "Our increasing focus on sustainability is central to our strategy. And this could be seen in our refreshed purpose and values and amended climate change position statement. Our purpose is simple; \u2018Delivering a more sustainable world\u2019 for generations to come. This increased sustainability focus is demonstrated through our work related to the energy transition which represents a growing of our revenue.",
         "Moving on to Slide 5. I\u2019d like to provide some context of these results. The pandemic has resulted in a rapidly changing environment for our business and it\u2019s for all business \u2013 for all businesses across the globe. We ended this period of global disruption in a stable financial position and we improved that position delivering a strong cash results and securing debt facilities. ",
         "We are proud of the decisive action we took to manage what we could control. We prioritized the protection of our people, modified field practices to keep our field-based people safe, quickly moved our office-based people to work-from-home and supported our customers and our communities. And we will continue to respond as the global impact of COVID-19 evolves and make adjustments to our business as required. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 6. While it\u2019s been a challenging time, we are very clear about path forward. We\u2019ve demonstrated our resiliency and have continued to make progress on our transformation. The impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices have acted as a catalyst to accelerate our transformation plans. ",
         "We\u2019ve changed the way we work by transitioning over 40,000 people to work-from-home and our field-based people continue to support over 180 critical Energy, Chemicals and Resource infrastructure sites around the world. We\u2019ve used our technology to help deliver this. ",
         "As an example, we\u2019ve seen our Microsoft team\u2019s usage increased by 35 million minutes a month since March. The steps we took would prove our liquidity position and the focus we had on cash has seen us deliver a strong cash result supported by improved in our DSO of 13 days in the half. ",
         "Our strong financial position has enabled us to increased our stake in the Transfield Worley Power Services to a 100% in July this year, supplement to the acquisition of 3sun in October 2109. These acquisitions contribute to our global power business expanding our already established O&M expertise and couples TWPS onshore wind capability with 3sun\u2019s offshore wind capability to produce an industry-leading service offering in the global independent power market. ",
         "We\u2019ve continued to make progress on our acquisition cost synergies and our operational savings. We\u2019ve released our revised climate change position statement which is core to our strategy and our future in \u2018Delivering a more sustainable world\u2019. ",
         "Turning to Slide 7. We\u2019ve diversified our earnings with operating expenditures accounting for almost 50% of our portfolio, compared to less than 10% in 2017 and the Chemicals sector now contributes 40% of our revenue, up from less than 10% pre-ECR acquisition. ",
         "We do not have material lump sum contract with most of our work been reimbursable. One of the biggest changes is our exposure to the oil and gas capital expenditure which is now approximately 20%, down from 65% historically. And the largest portion of our capital to CapEx exposure is in the long-term sustaining capital contract as opposed to major capital projects. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 8. In FY 2020, we worked a significant number of long-term contracts, some of which are included here. As you can see, these contracts span the world and add to our expansive portfolio of OpEx and sustaining capital contracts. We are proud of the fact that many of these long-term contracts or relationships that have been in place for over twenty years. ",
         "Turning to Slide 9. We continue to evolve our sustainability program as we transform our business. Our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact principles remains as strong as it was eleven years ago when we first became a member. We support and report our sustainability performance against the United Nations Sustainability Development goals. ",
         "Life, our safety, health and well-being approach guide us as we support our people and the communities in which we serve. We have a mature system of governance and operational controls in place to instill and reinforce a culture of actively acting lawfully, ethically and of course responsibly. ",
         "We are committed to solving the world\u2019s most complex challenges holding ourselves accountable with our own commitments and the role we can play is delivering a more sustainable world. Through the work our customers [Technical Difficulty] This is supported through the sustainability components of our leaders in incentive program. ",
         "Over the past year, the world has been responding to - sorry. Moving on to Slide 10. Over the past year, the world has been responding to forces more powerful than any one geographies. These focus include climate change, the energy transition and the increasing importance of the circular economy and the digitalization of our industries. ",
         "These challenges are changing our markets as well as customers see themselves and the role in the Energy, Chemicals and Resource sectors. Sustainable economic growth is vital as the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. It will put people back to work, help communities rebuild and support achieve the past agreements. And we have an important role to play in all of this. ",
         "We provide knowledge, intellectual property, technology solutions at scale to address some of the world\u2019s most complex sustainability challenge. Sustainability presents expanded opportunities for our business and it\u2019s core to our future. ",
         "Turning to Slide 11. Our commitment to sustainability is demonstrated in our revised climate change position statements which we launched at Investor Day. It\u2019s the single most clear signal of our commitment to again trying the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We formed a strategy and articulate the role we will play which type of project we will work on and which one we would choose not to work on and also in the decisions we make each and every day. ",
         "We are committed to achieving net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. These are direct emissions from sources that we own or control such as generators at yards and indirect emissions that come from purchased energy such as the energy we use as to power our buildings around the world. ",
         "We are also committed to proactively supporting our customers to reduce their own emissions on their projects and assets globally. To deliver the projects and infrastructure required to transition the world\u2019s energy system, this will require knowledge, technology and technical expertise and this is where we will have the biggest impact. ",
         "We\u2019ve made progress on our strategic actions. We\u2019ve piloted our Sustainable Solutions process on selected projects in urban Australia with our tier-1 customers and have strengthened our responsible business assessment standards.",
         "Turning to Slide 12. Although the world in which we live has changed, our focus on safety, health and the well-being of our people haven\u2019t. It\u2019s at the full prism of everything we do building on the strong safety culture from both of our heritage organizations. We maintain industry-leading performance this year reporting \u2013 reportable case frequency rates of 0.16. ",
         "This year however, we sadly lost a member of our team. One of our vehicles was traveling on a public road, when the power haul failed and it impacted the vehicle and so we lost a member of our colleague and keep that family and friends in our thoughts. ",
         "In the pursuit of the continuous improvement we launched Life, our safety, health and well-being approach which connects our health, safety and environment practices systems and tools under One Worley program. ",
         "In FY 2020, we introduced four Life programs, Life-saving rules, Take 5 for safety, Life Conversations, and Life Matters. The safety health, and well-being of ourselves and those around us is fundamentals to Life. Without this, nothing we do is worth doing. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 13. Before I hand over to Tom, I\u2019d like to highlight the following: Our business is performing with aggregated revenue of 75% from the prior corresponding period and underlying EBITA of 80%. We\u2019ve improved our financial strength. Our underlying operating cash flow is $881 million and our gearing is well below target range. ",
         "We are delivering our ECR acquisition benefits ahead of expectations. And our diversified has been more resilient since the acquisition of ECR and we\u2019ve achieved cost synergy savings of $177 million runrate, exceeding our previously announced targets and as I have shared, we\u2019ve now raised this target to $190 million annual runrate and we are transforming faster to emerge stronger. ",
         "We are accelerating our transformation strategy and we will deliver $275 million of annualized operational savings. ",
         "I\u2019ll now hand over to Tom to run through the financials in more detail. "
      ],
      "Chris Ashton ": [
         "Thanks, Tom. So, let\u2019s turn to Slide 32. We\u2019ve been on a transformation journey since we completed the ECR acquisition. We\u2019ve diversified our markets and solidified our leadership position and we\u2019ve been preparing for fundamental shifts that the industries that we work and are facing. COVID-19 has acted as a catalyst for our transformation and we are now transforming faster to emerge stronger. ",
         "We are driving with control change to shift how we work and I believe the COVID-19 impact has probed this forward by much as decade. We are simplifying our business and support our customers to drive new ways of working and support the execution of our strategy. And part of the transformation strategy is about being clear on how we see ourselves and the role we play. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 33. People from across the business have been involved in conversations about our purpose. Who we are? What we believe in? What we stand for and the difference we believe we can make. The safety purpose is what drives us, is what pushes, it\u2019s what gets started better in the morning and we\u2019ll emerge from that quest with a few simple words, \u2018Delivering a more sustainable world\u2019. ",
         "It puts our passion, our skills and our beliefs at the center of some of the biggest challenges on the planet to help make the world sustainable for generations to come. Alongside our purpose are our values. Our challenge is to live these values in every interaction with each other, our customers, and also communities in which we operate and the communities we serve. ",
         "I am excited to step into our future and make a difference in these communities delivering a more sustainable world for the benefit of the future generations. ",
         "Turning to Slide 34. Sustainability is a driving force for Worley. I\u2019ve been surprised with the rate of change over the past six months and the conversations I\u2019ve been having with many of our customers around our own sustainability commitments. ",
         "These markets continues to grow and our customers will need to invest to achieve that own sustainability goals. With the knowledge, experience and scale to support our customers as they are navigating the changing world. ",
         "Turning to Slide 35. We believe we have a significant role to play in supporting our customers while they transform our businesses looking to more sustainable development investments and more sustainable outcomes for the world. ",
         "Some of the focus areas for ourselves on the economies where we are delivering ways to energy solutions, developing a sustainable technology, technologies and a example of this is our NextOre ore sorting technology, which helps mining companies reduce energy consumption and site waste and of course the energy transition. ",
         "We\u2019ve been sharing our energy transition at speeds with efficient time and include a snapshot of some of our capability on the right-hand side of the slide. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 36. The energy transition is critical for delivering a more sustainable world. We\u2019ve seen some of our customers reduce their overall capital spend this year. However, they\u2019ve retained a real part of investment which is reflected in our sales pipeline. ",
         "Oil and gas will still be needed. They remain pivotal to our energy systems and through technologies their associated emissions will be reduced. Gas in particular will be used as a transition fuel for some time. Our customers\u2019 existing assets will still need to be operated and still need to be maintained during this transition. ",
         "But our customers will also required in order to deliver the required changes. New technologies and digital capabilities will be enablers for sustainability success and we have a role in supporting our customers in all of these aspects. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 37. We\u2019ve been clear on our strategy in the role we have in the energy transition. Our energy transition work is growing and with the broad sustainability-related work and prospect pipeline also grows. Supporting both new and existing customers, energy transition revenues represent around half of our Energy sector revenue. ",
         "For example, we are now providing inspection and maintenance services to offshore wind farm operators, as well as supporting oil and gas majors in carbon capture and storage projects. ",
         "As we look at our sales pipeline, we are seeing acceleration in electrification, decarbonization and the circular economy opportunities in particular. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 38. We\u2019ve been responding to our markets and building both energy transitions and sustainability capabilities for some time. 3sun, our offshore wind and inspection maintenance service provider has expanded its reach since joined the group extending on the North Sea to Europe. We\u2019ve had ten contract awards and extensions since the acquisition including wins with new customers. ",
         "Worley\u2019s global reach together with 3sun\u2019s expertise has been a key differentiator to secure many of these contracts. ",
         "Our Veckta joint venture with XENDEE has long over 31,000 microgrids since inception and has delivered distributed energy system projects across North America and APAC. And most recently, we increased our stake in Transfield Worley Power Services to a 100%. TWPS is an operations and maintenance business providing service to support critical power infrastructure across Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia. TWPS has experience across a range of power technologies including solar, wind, and hydro. ",
         "Now coupled with 3sun\u2019s offshore wind capabilities, with an industry-leading service offering in the global independent wind power market and with the leverage TWPS\u2019 leadership in digital technologies across our global operations and maintenance business.",
         "Moving to Slide 39. We\u2019ve been supporting our customers around the world across the sustainability spectrum. A small sample across the industries we serve is shown here. These are transformative solutions. We are designing a flagship facility in The Netherlands supporting its transition to a bio-based economy for plastics. Our projects contribute over 50% of the renewable diesel capacity in the U.S. ",
         "These are many complex sustainability challenges such as how businesses respond as customers demand more sustainable products and how we will help emerging economies develop without locking \u2013 to a clear emissions future. These are big and complex challenges and this is where Worley excels.",
         "Turning to Slide 40. We are proud of our Australian heritage and we are supporting customers and governments locally in that sustainability journey across the full asset life cycle drawing on our considerable global expertise. We hold vast intellectual property endangered by the design, management operation and maintenance of Australia\u2019s and the world\u2019s critical Energy Chemicals and Resource infrastructure. ",
         "We provide operations and maintenance service to approximately a third of Australia\u2019s base load power generation fleet and with the largest independent wind farm operator in Australia. ",
         "Turning to Slide 41. I will now provide an update on our markets. In the upstream and midstream market the significant decline in oil and gas prices has led to a reduction in near-term investments. However, markets are forecast to rebalance and investment is expected to continue. ",
         "In the offshore markets more investments continues to grow. Our post-acquisition capabilities improved our ability to deliver offshore projects across the full asset life cycle starting from concept and running through the commissioning, as well as subsequent maintenance modifications and operations. The onshore market has been particularly hard hit by the disruptions due to the pandemic and lower oil prices. ",
         "However, as seen on the chart at the top right, there is still significant brand sales and sustaining capital spend in this market and we\u2019ve been successfully increasing our proportion of revenue from Brownfield investments and are well positioned for future growth opportunities in this area. ",
         "Gas will remain a dry fuel source supported by the energy transition with global energy demand expected to double by 2040 as shown in the chart to the bottom right. Even with the rapid change in the energy mix in the International Energy Authority Sustainable Development Scenario , gas will continue to play a major role in energy markets for decades to come. ",
         "Together with our customers and our industry partners we are supporting the electrification and decarbonization of facilities and the development of technologies such as carbon capture, carbon capture utilization, and storage and the rapidly emerging hydrogen states.",
         "Moving on to Slide 42. We\u2019ve included some project case studies in the upstream and midstream sectors providing some insights into how we are applying our energy transition and digital expertise to these market segments, I am not going to go into these in detail. ",
         "So moving on to Slide 43. Turning to the power sector. Investment has shown resilience due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the renewables markets while power consumption overall has dropped by approximately 10% by shutdowns generated from renewable was actually increasing by a 5% according to the International Energy Agency. ",
         "Considering the resiliency of the renewable sector, we anticipate continued increased of investment in this sector. Offshore wind farm forecast capacity is set to increase by at least 15 fold worldwide by 2040 and that any negative impact from COVID-19 is expected only to be temporary. ",
         "All of the European oil majors are focusing and forecasting significant investments in the renewable sector going forward. European governments have communicated their hydrogen strategy in the last weeks that includes government support for the advancement of hydrogen technology and infrastructure support for decarbonization of the industrial and transport sectors as part of the recovery plans and the European Green Deal. ",
         "Our power business will continue to drive growth in technologies of high complexity and low risk with commoditization including hydrogen offshore wind and distributed energy systems. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 44. The slide highlights some case studies in which [Indiscernible] transition and digital expertise in the power sector. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 45. This slide shows the trends in the refining and chemicals sectors. You can see global refinery utilization rates in 2020 are expected to be the lowest since the 1980s according to the IDA. The transportation fuels it\u2019s clear demand loss and aviation will last for extended period of time with the International Air Transport Association reporting air travel is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024. ",
         "With reduced demand in new capacity entering the marketplace, refining overcapacity will be around 3 million barrels a day and rationalization is inevitable in 2020 to 2021, especially for older, small refineries in developed countries. ",
         "The chemical industry has experienced some supply side impacts both supply side impacts from change, availability or refinery feedstocks, as well as demand side impacts with increased use for packaging, medical supplies and surfactants, as well as reduced use in durable applications such as automotive and construction. ",
         "With either the demand for chemicals and plastics starts to normalize, it\u2019s expected to below the pre-pandemic levels until economic and social confidence returns at which point we expect it to revamp. ",
         "Moving to Slide 46. This slide highlights some case studies in the refining and chemicals sectors, again highlighting how companies in these industries are contributing to the energy transition. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 47. This slide captures Mining Minerals and Metals and resource infrastructure work. COVID-19 had a moderate and varying impacts on mine commodities and metal prices. ",
         "The combination of returning demand led by the restart of the Chinese economy and supply disruptions in some major commodities and in most cases same price recover to levels that continue to encourage investments helped by a good basis by both precious metals and iron ore pricing, together with good operations performance miners has maintained very strong free cash flows and confidence in the long-term market outlook is expected to see the world\u2019s top-50 miners continue to invest and replace some capacity and high return growth options. ",
         "We are seeing increased focus from our customers on the electrification of their operations and energy source switching as they look to benefit from low cost renewable and work to lower their emissions in carbon reduction commitments. Our customers have confidence in the long-term demand for energy transition commodities such as copper, lithium and nickel and new technologies are expected to play an increasing role as our customers love to produce low Co2 metals. ",
         "Moving to Slide 48. The slide highlights some case studies of Worley in action in the mining minerals and metals sector. Across all sectors, we are seeing the push toward the adoption of new energy sources, technologies in our locations as companies transition to a low carbon future. We are also getting involved in using new energy technologies to help communities progress where these operations are based. ",
         "Moving on to Slide 49 and the outlook. I\u2019d like to make some concluding comments before I turn to the outlook statement. So, turning to Slide 50. I believe we made significant progress during what has been one of the most disruptive periods in the recent history. Our revenue is up 75%, EBITA is 80% and NPATA is up 65%. We\u2019ve delivered a notable operating cash flow of $881 million. ",
         "We\u2019ve improved our financial strength and we continue to deliver on our ECR acquisition commitments, while also accelerating our transformation. Our diversified business is providing us with resilience as we accelerate our transformational strategy. We are industry leader on a global scale in the Energy, Chemicals and Resource sectors and are delivering solutions for our customers during this period of change. ",
         "We are well positioned to deliver on the expanded sustainability opportunities that are emerging. We have a critical role to play in the future supporting our customers and governments both nationally and globally in delivering a more sustainable world. ",
         "Moving to Slide 51. The current economic circumstances have led to a rapidly changing environment for Worley's business. We have managed business fundamentals with agility and we will continue to adjust as the global disruption evolves. ",
         "We are a more resilient business following the completion of the acquisition of ECR with increased diversification across geographies and sectors as well as greater exposure to our customers' operating expenditures. Our diversification will continue to be important as different sectors and regions recover at different rates. ",
         "In FY2021 we will continue to prioritize protecting our people, maintaining financial and operational integrity and supporting our customers, to create value for all of our shareholders. We are on track to deliver the ECR acquisition cost synergy target, as well as the operational savings target as we accelerate our transformation. We will consider balance sheet capacity for high return opportunities in line with our transformation strategy.",
         "The long-term market continues to indicate that sustainability, including the energy transition, and the digitalization of our industries will open up opportunities across all of the sectors we serve. Worley has the global scale, and the technical and financial strength to support our Energy, Chemicals and Resources customers as they themselves navigate a changing world.",
         "Moving on to Slide 52, I would just like to say thank you for the time and Tom and I are now happy to take questions. "
      ],
      "Tom Honan": [
         "Thanks, Chris. I\u2019ll begin by focusing on some of the highlights of the year starting on Slide 15. It won\u2019t surprise anyone who knows me, so I\u2019d like to start with cash. ",
         "Underlying operating cash generation during the year hit $881 million, driven by a 13 day improvement in last year\u2019s \u2013 of six months. I\u2019ll talk later about how that was achieved, but just as a preview, it was hard work. Both our aggregate revenue and underlying EBITA were up over 75% when compared to FY 2019, more than 7% when compared to pro forma FY 2019 numbers. ",
         "Gearing is well below target range. Leverage has decreased to 1.8 times, down from 1.9 times at the half. We strengthened our liquidity position through a strong cash result and securing debt facilities. The strengthening of the liquidity position is especially pleasing given the external market situation. ",
         "We\u2019ve delivered $177 million of annual ECR synergies on a runrate basis at the end of June and we increased our target runrate to $190 million and committing to bring the delivery of this forward to April 2021, which is six months earlier than previously notified. ",
         "We are also on track to deliver operational cost savings of $275 million runrate by December 2021, in addition to the ECR synergies. And that\u2019s already having delivered a runrate of $165 million. ",
         "I\u2019ll turn now to our statutory results on Page 16. As statement of financial performance outlines our stat results, this has been released in the financial report launched with the AS 6 earlier today. Some points to note are our statutory revenue has increased across all major lines of business. The statutory bottom-line result increased this year as a result of the addition of ECR for the full year and improved underlying performance. ",
         "Turning now to Slide 17. We report our results excluding the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles to better reflect the operating performance of the company. You\u2019ll see references on this basis to EBITA and NPATA throughout the document. ",
         "After taking into account a number of adjustments, which include acquisition and transition costs relating to the ECR transaction of $147 million, transformation and restructuring cost of $121 million and the amortization of intangibles at a $109 million, we derive an underlying net profit after tax and before amortization NPATA of $432 million, up 66% from $260 million in the PCP. ",
         "Turning now to Slide 18. Here we\u2019ve highlighted the statutory and underlying key financials for FY 2020. We achieved improvement in revenue due to 12 months contribution from ECR. Not surprisingly, our EBITA and NPATA results also improved. Our EBITA and aggregated revenue also both improved on the FY 2019 pro forma. ",
         "Despite the economic circumstances we have experienced this year, our underlying EBITA margin was aligned with the FY 2019 pro forma. At the underlying level, our EBITA margin reflects higher relative contribution from Chemicals, as well as synergy realization. Our underlying operating cash flow of $881 million stems from a strong company-wide push to cash collection across the Group, with as I said our DSO dropping by 13 days in the last six months. ",
         "The effective tax rate increased from 22% to 28% compared to the prior corresponding period reflecting the higher proportion of earnings coming from relatively high tax, but aside from jurisdictions like the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe. We see this level continuing as a greater proportion of earnings comes from these parts of the world. ",
         "I\u2019ll turn now to Slide 19. This slide provides further analysis to demonstrate how the underlying business is performing. Firstly, we\u2019ve shown the impact of synergies on this half. You\u2019ll note that $14 million of benefits were already delivered in the first half of FY 2020 and the half year runrate of those benefits is $28 million. The benefits from actions delivered in the most recent half is $23 million. ",
         "Added to this is the most recent shift of operating cost savings of $36 million achieved during the year relating to property rationalization and business restructure. Both of these factors more than offset the economic impact on Worley, which we calculated approximately $62 million. By focusing on the things within our control and taking action to manage costs, we\u2019ve increased earnings in the half despite the economic circumstances we have experienced. ",
         "I\u2019ll describe our cost synergies and operational savings in more detail shortly. Off to Slide 20. Overall aggregated revenue was up by 75% for the period which is driven by reporting 12 months of ECR business. ",
         "Segment outcomes are up across all lines of business. It should be noted that in FY 2020, certain global costs were reallocated to professional service costs and construction and fabrication costs and we reinstated the FY 2019 results for comparative purposes. ",
         "Margin improvement in Energy & Chemicals Services reflects the higher relative contributions from Chemicals customers, as well as synergy realization. While Advisian margin improvement can be attributed to the strong performance of our sulfur business. ",
         "The Mining, Minerals & Metals segment margin is in line with the underlying FY 2019 margin. The FY 2019 result was effected by positive project outcome on a relatively smaller aggregated revenue, which has amplified the result. The major projects in integrated solutions margin has decreased primarily to the increased volumes of lower margin construction revenue in North America. ",
         "I\u2019ll move now to Slide 21. This slide provides a summary of the progress over the past few years on NPATA metrics. The slight improvement in the EBITA margin reflects increased mix of revenue contribution from Chemicals, as well as synergy realization. This is against the backdrop of the increase in the proportion of revenue from lower margin construction work. ",
         "The NPATA margin, while improved from the first half was impacted by the higher effective tax rate as I\u2019ve described earlier from 28% versus 22% in prior period based on the increased earnings in high tax jurisdictions. ",
         "Moving to Slide 22. Our headcount was approximately 51,900 at the end of June, down around 12% from January. We\u2019ve seen a craft which was impacted to a greater extent than at staff due to COVID-19-related staff excess restrictions and deferred turnaround activity. ",
         "We continue to manage our staff utilization rate on target. This year managing of things are within our control is something we are focused on and utilization has been one those things. I will note that there has been no significant change to headcount and utilization in July. ",
         "I\u2019ll move to Slide 23. Our backlog is down by 10% to $16.8 billion from December 2019 to 30, June, 2020 although it\u2019s worth understanding the causes of that change. We are continuing to win work. ",
         "Our contract wins and renewals in the half have exceeded the value of backlog consumed. Backlog has been impacted by the effective COVID-19 on operations and maintenance contracts as a result of the postponement of the site shutdown season in the U.S. and site access restrictions. ",
         "Under our backlog definition, we effectively revalue our long-term operations maintenance contracts every six months by applying the current work hours runrate over a 36 month period. There is a minimum impact from project cancellations. Other courses of change were foreign exchange translation impacts and the sale of an asset from a tier-1 to a tier-2 customer as previously announced. ",
         "We continue to win work with around $2 billion of contracts awarded in quarter four in line with contracts awarded in the same period in FY 2019. ",
         "I\u2019ll move now to Slide 24. The current market conditions have seen backlog decline mostly in the Energy and Chemicals sectors in North America where the site shutdown season has been delayed and COVID-19 is impacting site access together with the previously mentioned foreign exchange translation and asset sales issues. ",
         "I\u2019ll turn now to Slide 25. As Chris mentioned previously, this year we have taken measures to strengthen our liquidity position. We extended $490 million of working capital for an additional 12 months and we secured an additional $465 million in 12 month facilities for a total of $945 million of renewed and established facilities. This was all achieved earlier in the calendar year. ",
         "Our liquidity position has also been strengthened by our strong underlying operating cash result of $881 million. ",
         "I\u2019ll turn to Slide 26. This slide presents a number of our key balance sheet metrics over time. The main take out of this slide is the improvement in leverage and gearing over the last couple of years delivering a stronger balance sheet even while we have invested almost $5 billion in acquisitions. We are stronger, more diverse and resilient business through these acquisitions. ",
         "And this hasn\u2019t been done at the expense of increasing balance sheet risk or contract risk. Traditionally, the business has performed much better on cash metrics in the second half. I am pleased to report that the improved operating cash flow performance in both the first and second halfs of FY 2020. There is no breakthrough practice or technology involved, just hard work and discipline. ",
         "Firstly, for our teams to deliver quality work and to invoice accurately and on time and finally to follow-up and collect the cash. The improvements in these practices in the businesses come together is a credit to all those involved. ",
         "Net debt on a covenant basis declined to $1.3 billion from $1.6 billion. And I am very pleased to report continued improvement in balance sheet metrics. Gearing is at 18.5% and leverage defined as net debt-to-EBITA of 1.8 times. ",
         "I\u2019ll turn now to 27. Our gearing ratio as I said, is at 18.5% calculated on the net debt to net debt plus equity basis, which is well below at a target of between 25% and 35%. Interest covers declined to 6.3 times and as I described leverage ratio is down to 1.8 times. Our average maturity of debt is 2.4 years. As I described, DSO has improved in the half by 13 days. ",
         "As we\u2019ve previously described, we moved three receivables from current to non-current and have triggered dispute resolution mechanisms to cover repayment from those SOEs. Collection from the fourth SOE continues in line with the expectations and the balance is now just a few million dollars. Due to the adoption of AASB 16 Leases on 1 January, 2019, our statutory debt includes lease liabilities of $435 million. ",
         "I\u2019ll move now to Slide 28. Looking at cost synergies on Slide 28, we\u2019ve delivered $177 million runrate savings at June 2020. We\u2019ve exceeded our previously announced target and have subsequently increased our target to $190 million runrate savings by April 2021. ",
         "This is $60 million or almost 50% higher than our initial synergy estimates at the time of the acquisition announcement. This increase comes from a broad review of the cost synergies with the three main markets continuing to be IT, property, and overhead rationalization. ",
         "The remaining savings are related to the completion of the integration of back-office core systems and the activities relating to IT networks and systems. The estimated one-off cost associated with delivering the synergy target are approximately $125 million with an additional $15 million of CapEx. There are modernization cost of $45 million plus $35 million of CapEx. ",
         "I\u2019ll move now to Slide 29. In June, we announced $275 million in operational cost savings to be delivered by December 2021 in addition to the ECR cost synergies. And to-date, we have secured a runrate of $165 million of these savings as at the end of June 2020. Most of these were delivered at the very end of the year. ",
         "The citings are across four main areas which is discretionary spends, property rationalization, business restructure and shared services. In terms of discretionary spend we are ahead of runrate for key spend categories in areas in like travel. At the moment we are obviously not traveling. But there is a baseline level of travel which will return. We have only included the savings down to a normalized level of travel in these numbers. ",
         "Our budgets for FY 2021 are already reflective of the reduced spends and we are embedding new ways of working to make this sustainable. We are well progressing in terms of property rationalization which represents 30% of the target with 65% of these savings to be realized by December 2020 that has been in place since 1 July with the majority of the savings to be in place by October of 2020.",
         "In shared services, the program has commenced and we\u2019ll get into this from a completion of our back-office integration later this calendar year. We are on track to deliver the runrate savings of $275 million by a target date of December 2021. ",
         "I\u2019ll turn now to Slide 30. We\u2019ve achieved some important milestones in working as one organization with common platforms. Our back-office systems integration is on track. We recently went live with our core HR and expenses applications for our legacy WorleyParsons People and the rest of the business will follow soon. ",
         "The Finance ERP application is on track to be fully integrated later this calendar year. The systems effort is progressing well and we have completed remote user acceptance testing as a result of the current environment. ",
         "UIT was slightly delayed due to COVID-19, but we are still well on track for a successful rollout. Having common platforms has been a huge enabler for our people working from home during COVID-19 and we are \u2013 real debt of gratitude to all our people who have enabled us to report these results in such times. ",
         "I\u2019ll now pass back to Chris to discuss our transformation strategy and provide a market update. Thanks, Chris. "

What change that happened is there is a difference between the type of work. So, the O&M work, the construction type related activity is obviously at a much lower margin than the engineering work, the design work, construction management type work that we do. ",
            "And if you break it up between those, there is not a significant difference. As you know, in a couple of markets, there might be some pricing pressure, but across the board, we don\u2019t see a large change. Anything you want to add to that, Chris? "

            "So, pricing isn\u2019t all about the customer side. It\u2019s about the customer supply side and what we are finding is, throughout this process, the reach out from our customers are senior \u2013 the senior executives of our customers reaching out to reinforce that commitment to us, reinforcing in parts of the relationship, has been very positive and more frequent than I\u2019ve seen in very well back to 2014 to the current environment, we are seeing far great level of reach out and the customers look \u2013 they reassure us that they are committed to continuing to work on the relationships.

Mindful of a very strong conversion in the second half, will that have any representation and flow through into the first half of 2021.

It was also very good, much better than it has been previously and I think this is just a continuation of that.

They embraced the concept of being empowered to go there and collect and focus on collections and getting it out of the past. ",

We obviously have significant salary bills, every week, every fortnight, every month depending where we are in the world and we obviously keep those accounts refreshed and able to meet those salary bills.
