At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]",

         "Thank you, Braden, and thank you to everyone for joining the call this morning. The COVID-19 pandemic has required us all to adapt to a substantial behavioral and cultural shift in the way we interact with one another. The experiment of working from home has been met with mixed reviews and many have concerns about the impact it could have on company culture and employee engagement. For many companies, Slate included, culture is a key competitive advantage. Our view is that companies will not risk their ability to attract and retain the best people just to save money on office space.",
         "The REIT collected 96% to 97% of rent in cash within each month of the second quarter, and we expect to substantially collect the residual rent through short-term deferral agreements. Our industry-leading rent collections are a function of both the quality of our tenant base and the strength of our team. Approximately 61% of our income is generated from government and credit-rated tenancies, with limited concentration to nonessential retail and the energy sector.",
         "Now a few comments on the second quarter. The REIT completed over 100,000 square feet of leasing in Q2 at an average rent increase of 14%. The most notable renewal was approximately 29,000 square feet with a national accounting firm at Gateway Centre in Markham for a 10-year term. Our weighted average remaining lease term is 5.4 years, with in-place rents on average 9% below market. The REIT\u2019s financial performance continued to improve in the second quarter, highlighted by a 5% increase in adjusted funds from operations, further strengthening our payout ratio to 61.9%. Our loan-to-value ratio finished the quarter at 58.3%. The REIT has ample liquidity to fund ongoing operations, especially considering the strength of our rent collections and our prudent management of operating and capital spend.",
         "The last few months have presented us with unique set of challenges. However, we assembled our portfolio to be resilient in times like these and we continue to be pleased with the stability of the REIT\u2019s cash flows and operating performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are feeling very optimistic about the future, and we remain committed to working hard to further build on the quality of our portfolio. On behalf of the entire Slate Office REIT team, we wish you good health, and we thank you for your continued support.",
         "I will now hand it over for Q&A."

But anecdotally and through our property management partners, we\u2019ve seen the utilization rates about 30% to 40% across the portfolio, which we\u2019re not privy to our peers that have downtown assets. But anecdotally, we believe that to be higher than what we\u2019re seeing downtown, just given the suburban nature of our properties and the ability of existing tenants that drive to those buildings, not have to use elevators and have a less dense environment within their workspace. And further in the secondary markets that we\u2019re in, such as Atlantic Canada, things are really opening up there a lot sooner than we\u2019ve seen in the GTA or some of the more major concentrated markets."

The larger tenants are still where they have opportunities to are still renewing in place, either in our portfolio or competitors\u2019 portfolios. And \u2013 so we\u2019re not seeing a lot of new leasing velocity at this point on a larger scale."

So together \u2013 Jonathan, the write-down that we took that was related to actual property fundamentals was in Q2 when we revised our leasing expectations on new leasing for the balance of the year in light of the pandemic. The adjustment that you saw in Q2 was entirely driven by FX."

At this point in time, I can\u2019t tell you the exact outcome of that. But from our perspective, we\u2019re going to continue to have Bell on the covenant. And further, we\u2019ll have Equinix, which is, as you know, over $1 billion company. So we think it just strengthens the overall covenant from Slate Office REIT\u2019s perspective."

            "Yes. No, that\u2019s right, Chris. The hotel, for obvious reasons, has had a tough quarter, and we\u2019ll continue, the balance of the year will be difficult as well relative to the prior year. So year-to- date, we\u2019re down about $900,000 in income at the hotel versus the prior year. And the balance of the year will be another $900,000 versus the prior year, roughly. However, the distribution of that throughout the year, we\u2019re starting to see returning to profitability starting in July here. We are starting to see the Atlantic bubble drive some leisure demand. We\u2019ve also been fortunate enough to secure some group\u2019s critical workers and companies that have a need for project. People working that need quarantine space. So we\u2019ve been very fortunate in that regard. So the balance of the year will be profitable, but it just won\u2019t be at the same levels that we had seen in prior years"

      "24": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Got it. And then just maybe lastly, with respect to overall occupancy, I think your commentary alluded to belief in good renewal activity, but maybe a moderation in new leasing activity. What are your thoughts on kind of overall portfolio occupancy? I know it\u2019s probably challenging to pin it down. But if you \u2013 any color on where you think that might be trending? Any \u2013 are there any planned move-outs that you\u2019re aware of for the balance of the year?"

      "25": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. No, that\u2019s right. And we had some known vacates, as you know, that we\u2019ve messaged in the past, primarily in Atlantic Canada. That are going to put a slight headwind for us in the balance of the year from an occupancy perspective. Those predated COVID. So to be clear, they\u2019re not COVID related, and we don\u2019t expect any incremental known vacates as a result of COVID. And in fact, we probably expect more renewal activity for the balance of the tenants.",
            "With respect to occupancy guidance for the balance of the year, as we messaged in the last quarter, we have reduced our expectation of new leasing, and that\u2019s reflective in our IFRS values as well. I think the current level we\u2019re at right now, our goal is to maintain that current level, but it\u2019s probably more likely that we would reduce occupancy slightly by the end of the year, then increase it.",
            "But looking forward to 2021, some of the \u2013 we had a strong pipeline prior to the pandemic of some larger transactions in Atlantic Canada, in particular. And I think those will start to pick up steam again in 2021. They haven\u2019t gone away. They\u2019ve just sort of been put on hold."

         "Remarks": [

         ],

      },
      "27": {
         "Remarks": [
            "That\u2019s correct. Yes. The government tenant that we had done a 40,000 square foot lease deal with and messaged in Q1 have expanded by an incremental 7,000 square feet. And so that brings our committed occupancy of that building to 52%. And the second floor of the building, we\u2019re actively trying to lease. It will be \u2013 by its nature and physical layout, it will be larger tenant space. So I think in this environment, it may take some time to backfill that."

Going forward, we have a plan in place. Those maturities that are coming up are mostly our credit facilities. We have strong relationships with those banks. And we do have a plan in place, but it\u2019s a bit early to really comment too much further on what we have there, but we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll get something done that\u2019s aligned with the terms we\u2019re expecting."

So not technically coming off a 10-year lease, but yes, this was a tenant that just \u2013 they had strong conviction in the amount of space that they required. And they were willing to commit to it long-term. We did receive about an 18% increase in rents.

So I\u2019m just wondering in the context of that comment, is it indicative of some of the growth plans you might have to expand into the suburbs in the U.S.?

As I mentioned to Jonathan earlier, we\u2019ve seen the utilization rates higher in the suburbs. And we do have a macro view that as larger portions of the workforce, i.e., millennials and the talent pool move out of the densely populated cities, we\u2019ll start to see companies want to follow them. And it won\u2019t benefit all suburban office, but suburban office like we own, which is well located and with strong amenities and good access to transit and parking will benefit from this longer-term trend."

But we do think it\u2019s a little early. We have an abundance of liquidity right now. But we think it\u2019s prudent strategy to preserve our cash. At this point in time, it\u2019s difficult to price risk in this market on new acquisitions. So we\u2019re \u2013 our strategy is to be patient and revisit allocation, yes."

We think that there\u2019s likely some capital structure distress that will happen with certain ownership groups. And we think that needs to play out before there\u2019s a realistic \u2013 there\u2019s less of a wide bid-ask spread and something that we can be opportunistic on and transact on."

If the question is about whether they have a different view on working from the office in the long term versus work from home, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s materially different.

I\u2019ve heard other landlords suggest that tenants have been \u2013 they\u2019ve had more tenants asking for incremental space versus wanting to shed any space. I can tell you with our portfolio, we haven\u2019t had really requests one way or the other. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just the nature of suburban versus downtown or secondary markets versus primary markets. But any tenants that we have that are maturing in the short-term are looking for some flexibility in terms of how long they\u2019re willing to commit on their renewal. And that\u2019s, I think, a trend that we\u2019re seeing across the industry. But it\u2019s not coming with a request to downsize or request to increase space at this point."
