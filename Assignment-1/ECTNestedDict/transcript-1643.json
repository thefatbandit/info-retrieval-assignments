      "Henrik Andersen": [
         "Good morning, everyone. And a warm welcome to the Q2 presentation from Vestas.",
         "From me and on behalf of Executive Management here, first, I would like just to extend a huge thank you to our colleagues around the world. I think for their commitment, their dedication and also how we have been able to absolutely focus on business continuity is nothing less than exceptional in a quarter like the second quarter of 2020.",
         "And with that, I would just like to take you directly to our key highlights. So in Q2 2020, we had strong performance in, again, a challenging environment, and we have gone through this without having any \u2013 received any state aid in any of our countries. Revenue was \u20ac3.5 billion. It's up 67% compared to the Q2 in 2019. Our order intake continued at a very high level at stable pricing. So we took 4.1 gigawatt of order intake in second quarter. It also leads to an all-time high backlog of \u2013 in excess of \u20ac35 billion.",
         "In terms of the EBIT margin, we had an underlying EBIT margin of 5.9%. That was impacted by an extraordinary warranty provision of \u20ac175 million, meaning that the reported EBIT margin for the quarter is 1%. We had another stellar performance in our Service business. Organic growth of 6% in Service in Q2, organic growth compared to Q2 2019, and EBIT margin of 28.5%. Today, we will also give a bit more details of our sustainability. So our CO2 targets scientifically were approved accordingly and verified accordingly to the Paris Agreement. And we'll come back to that with a bit more details in the presentation.",
         "First, I would like just to give a highlight of how have we actually gone through the Q2 in terms of the COVID-19 crisis. You know we have done this without any state aid, but we've also done it with a primary focus on keeping everyone safe at work and also back home. And it also leads to that when we then set out to do that, it was with business continuity as the prime driver for us when the COVID-19 broke out in February in China. So again, here, a big thank you to our customers and also to our partners, in terms of suppliers and partners around the world, and also again to the colleagues.",
         "I think it's also fair saying we're in Copenhagen, it's Europe, we probably have a little bit more relaxed attitude toward COVID-19 in the societies, but we also have to appreciate epicenters right now are still Americas, it's India, South Africa. So therefore, we really, really have to be fully attentional to live by the protocols and also keep going. Suppliers have generally caught up and managed really well, and very pleased with also the support and the commitment to catch up during second quarter of this year.",
         "I think when we come down to all of this, we can talk about how well we are managing both the manufacturing and the supply chain coming into the factories, especially in some of these epicenters around the world. But I think nothing better speaks to the evidence of that we, in first half of 2020, we manufactured and shipped 9.6 gigawatt, which is up 60% compared to the same period 2019. And of course, this is the underlying also support to come out and reinstate our guidance for the year.",
         "So we then go to the second quarter order intake, as said, 4.1 gigawatts. We had a slightly lower order intake in the comparable quarter in 2019, where you would appreciate U.S. have been a very dominant factor in Q2 2019. In Q2 2020, we have seen large orders in U.S., China, Vietnam and The Netherlands, were among the main contributors.",
         "When we then look at the ASP, very stable. Remain stable also throughout Q2. Of course, with the usual caveat of that geography, turbine and scope, of course, influence the ASP of \u20ac0.78 million.",
         "That leads to an all-time high order backlog. It's in excess of \u20ac35 billion. It's up 11% compared to the similar time last year. So we passed \u20ac16 billion in terms of the turbine business. And as you would see, we have nearly now at \u20ac19 billion in the Service. And you would also have seen from the announcement that we have passed 100 gigawatt on the Service.",
         "If we give a little bit more details on the Power solution, we have had, as said again, a strong focus on securing the business continuity and very pleased to say that has really succeeded in the quarter. We have a broad-based order intake from across EMEA, and that has not yet been influenced by the Green Deal, but of course, we also take a note of that a lot of countries are now talking about green recovery program as part of also looking ahead, not only to the coming year but probably more to the coming decade of that green renewable transition.",
         "We also positively here have seen a \u2013 start building of a pipeline in 2021 deliveries for the U.S. We have had more than one gigawatt of order intake for the U.S. in the second quarter. And as we have been saying, at least throughout the last couple of quarters, with the changes to the PTC, this is important that we, together with customers, can do those calculation and order intake correctly.",
         "Positively here in the quarter is also Asia Pacific. We have seen a higher number of orders in Vietnam and China. So a proper progress in terms of order intake, as you will see, up 281% compared to probably what is a little low last year, but very pleased to see overall.",
         "When we look at the Service business, as mentioned, 100 gigawatt, a big milestone. And therefore, also congratulations to the Service business because you have really executed not only on the order intake but also more than 10,000 colleagues delivering under very challenging conditions.",
         "So highlight of the quarter, we had sort of the first AOM 5000 service contract in the U.S. for the new EnVentus turbine. We have taken a number of multi-brand contracts across Asia Pacific, especially on the Senvion turbines, of which at least some with larger duration. And then overall, we have approximately 70% of our order intake has a tenure above twenty years, which now leads to that we have a service backlog that is above nine years, which, of course, gives us a very, very, very strong foundation for future development of the Service business.",
         "We just, in the bottom here, show \u2013 which is quite impressive, show the comparison against where were we in Q2 2019, where you can see the increases in gigawatt in both Americas, EMEA and APAC, and very pleased with all three development there.",
         "When it comes to the offshore, again, a normal quarter, and we have seen here, as you would expect, the firm order was signed on the 1.1 gigawatt Seagreen project in Scotland. That included a 15-year service agreement as well. We have completed the Northwester 2 installation, and we are well under the way in installing the Borssele project also. It is already partly, and it is already also now partly in production of electricity, which, of course, very positive.",
         "Then we have completed the third and the final floating turbine into the WindFloat Atlantic project, which is off Portugal's coast. And of course, that again demonstrates our commitment to also keep innovating into the \u2013 to the foundation towards floating in offshore. Else in the bottom, you can see what other projects we have in progress, and I don't think there is any major news to that.",
         "So then I want also just to mention here, we are the first wind turbine manufacturing that have the validated strategy in line with the 1.5% [ph] global warming scenario accordingly to Paris Agreement.",
         "We had that validated from the Science Based Targets experts in the quarter, which especially is around our scope 1 and 2 emissions, which is carbon neutrality towards 2030, as you know. I also think here importantly is a lot of debate how do we then go around it. And you will see, so far, since first of January announcement, we have now changed more than 100 electric service vehicles, and we will both have service and benefit cars when we come towards the year-end, somewhere around 300 cars in total. So it does actually make a change and also an effort to demonstrate and put some commitment to it.",
         "If you're interested, please read Page 15 in the quarterly announcement, where you can read more about our other initiatives and also the progress, which we can only highlight and positively describe here.",
         "With that, I would hand over to Marika.",
         "Thank you, Marika.",
         "And that leaves us with discussing and putting, as we said here, reinstatement of our guidance for the year. And before we take the numbers, I just wanted to highlight here, it goes without saying that as we are in August, as some 142 days to go in the year, the important note here is that the basic assumptions does right now come with a higher uncertainty than normal because we are still in the middle of it and we talked about the epicenters of COVID-19 around the world.",
         "However, as we also have the increased visibility of the year, we now guide for revenue that is the same as we initially said in the beginning of the year, \u20ac14 billion to \u20ac15 billion. We have an EBIT margin before special items of 5% to 7%. Please, however, take a note of that that does include the extraordinary warranty provision of \u20ac175 million. And then as Marika rightly went through here, on the total investment side, where we, due to the initiatives we have taken earlier in the year, we now say it's below \u20ac700 million.",
         "So with that, we will end the presentation here and give the word back to the operator and Q&A."
      ],
      "Marika Fredriksson": [
         "Thank you, Henrik.",
         "So on the income statement, we clearly \u2013 you heard Henrik and the high activity level that we've had here in Q2 of 2020 despite the COVID-19 situation. So as a consequence and a very good job done by the organization, the revenue has increased with 67% compared to Q2 of last year. The gross margin is down as well as the EBIT primarily by the increased warranty permission performed here in Q2. And I will come back to that. We also saw a negative impact from COVID-19 here in the quarter. And you see that EBIT, as I said, is also down compared to last year. But bear in mind that the underlying EBIT margin before special items is in line with last year and actually coming up to a 5.9% here in the quarter. So altogether, very good activity level, also good leverage on the SG&A, as I will show you later.",
         "The SG&A cost continues to be well under control. And if you compare to last year, we are now on a 12-month rolling down to 5.7 percentage points compared to 7.2 in Q2 of last year. Depreciation and amortization, excluding the impairments that you have seen, increased year-over-year, primarily due to the new products that we have introduced and as well already highlighted by us. And if we go to the Service business, also continues good performance, as you heard from Henrik. We saw an increase in the Service revenue by 6% compared to Q2 2019 and an EBIT margin of 28.5 percentage points here in the quarter. So obviously, very solid and good performance in the Service business and also considering here that we are in a COVID-19 environment.",
         "MHI Vestas, we see a negative profit of \u20ac12 million, and our share of that profit is obviously \u20ac6 million. And again, anticipated, because we anticipated a low activity level here in 2020 for the offshore business. And primarily, what you see here is really the aftermarket activities performed. The change in net working capital, and you heard me say that before, that we continue to use the balance sheet to actually have a higher inventory than what you have seen previously, and this is also a fact here in Q2. The contract assets and liabilities are also increasing. And as a consequence of the high activity level, we see that payables are also getting up to a different level. I will come back on the consequences on the cash flow here in the quarter.",
         "Cash flow statement. The cash flow from operating activities is a good \u20ac296 million, and obviously up compared to last year. You see the big impact from the change in net working capital to actually be able to accommodate the overall high activity level anticipated here in the second quarter. And free cash flow before financial investments are more or less in line with last year despite the high increase in the change \u2013 or high change in working capital, so we come down to a negative of \u20ac78 million compared to \u20ac75 million last year. The total investments are down compared to last year. This doesn't mean that we don't continue to invest in our business in terms of accommodating both for high activity level and new technology. But you remember that we also took off 1 product line here or a platform in the last quarter. And obviously, that also have an effect here in Q2 when it comes to the net investments.",
         "Warranty provision and the lost production factor, you see here that we make an extraordinary provision of \u20ac175 million here in the quarter and also making the 3% \u2013 or to be correct, 3.1% in the quarter. So we have, all in all, \u20ac283 million, so a much higher level compared to last year. And obviously, that has an impact, as you have seen before, on the gross profit as well as the EBITDA. The LPF increased as a consequence of this extraordinary repair and upgrade level. So we are now above 2% here in Q2. The capital structure. Net debt to EBITDA, we are well below threshold. I don't think it's any surprise that this continues to be a very high focus from Vestas, and we continue to be in a good position. And the liquidity position remains very strong when we have close to \u20ac2 billion cash at hand at this point.",
         "By that, I leave the word to you."

      "2": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Thank you. So my first question is then on U.S. deliveries, which was obviously very strong here in Q2. Can you elaborate a bit on what we should think about the delivery schedule in the U.S. going forward? And especially how customers have reacted to the option provided by the IRS, which enables them to sort of push volumes from 2020 into 2021 and then still receive the 100% PTC level?"

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you, Kristian. I think a very, very relevant question, and as we said here, a lot of our focus also goes to the U.S. and the timing of it. Very pleased to see the progress we are making and a lot more is still to be done, but we are tracking that down to both days and weeks. It's also fair saying our discussion with customers are generally that no one, if they can, would postpone to 2021 if they can avoid. So in reality here, the commitment to a partnership here is that it's profitable, it's profitable from when it's commissioned and delivered, and therefore, people would like to stick to as early a delivery as possible. So as you can also see on our guidance, we are back in also getting most of that done, which we can, in that normal schedule we have."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. If I may just follow up, how are then the discussions around the projects, which has 80% PTC, which you can then postpone into 2022? Is there any delay in those discussions? Or is that progressing as planned as well?"

         "Remarks": [
            "I think there's a lot of those debate going on. And I think we've been open, last quarter, I think we were \u2013 and previous quarter, we were very much. I mean we have to appreciate here, around year-end we got the extension. And then we got a 2020 and 2021 possibility later in this year. So I think right now, there's a lot of those discussions going on. But as you would appreciate, whether you have 100% or an 80%, it is still profitable for customers to do. So now it's the schedule around how do we get into the schedule and what does both the projects but also permitting and, of course, our capacity allow people to generally do. But Kristian, you will appreciate both 100% and 80% PTC projects are profitable for the customer."

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Understood. Thank you. Then my second question is around this warranty provision. So in past couple of quarters, you've also increased warranty provision, sort of reflecting the new technology. To what extent have those past increases reflected the specific issue which you highlighted as an extraordinary provision here? And hence, is the total cost of repairing these blades actually more than the 7 \u2013 or \u20ac175 million?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Kristian Johansen"

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "You will appreciate that a provision like this doesn't come \u2013 and the root cause doesn't come in one go. So we have, over the last couple of quarters, looked in, it's a robust process around it. So of course, part of what we have been doing in the previous quarters have been to also look into this. So for us, that has affected the previous quarters to some extent, but we are now just saying here, knowing the root cause and also the specific repair and upgrade of it, that means we can now say that neither current nor future blades will have that requirement going forward. And therefore, we can then do the final one-off provisioning for the blade issue here."

      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "That's \u2013 you would appreciate, we don't share in that sense. So that is an ongoing discussion between us and also our customers and owners of the assets around the world. So there, we do this as we would normally do in any of our warranty or sim cases. So we don't do that breakdown."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you. Yes, also a few questions from my side. The first goes also to the extra provisions you did in Q2. Will there also be an impact on the Service division in next year, for instance, as some of these turbines are not living up to their up-and-running guarantee? That will be the first question."

      },
      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And then my second question goes to the EBIT margin or the gross margin. If you look at the Power division, excluding these one-offs, then the gross margin is still, I guess, below 10% for the Power division. Is there any other significant extra cost into that number? And what would it take to lift it to be double-digit at least?"

      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I would say, if you look at the gross margin, obviously, the biggest impact in the Q, what you see here is the warranty provision. But also remember, compared to last year, we actually already, with 3.1%, have a higher warranty provision as a comparison. So obviously, that is part of the explanation. Then we have extraordinary cost or COVID-related cost that has an impact here in the quarter and, as a consequence, on the gross profit. And I mean, running the business in an environment that we're in right now, obviously, is not free of charge in any shape or form. And we see extra cost, in particular, for the transportation and the logistics for the turbine operations."

      },
      "18": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So it is mainly the latter that is taking down the gross margin below 10% even when we exclude the provisions?"

         "Speaker": "Claus Almer"
      },
      "19": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I would say yes. All of that in summary is having an impact on the gross profit for the Power solution."

      "23": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Thank you. And maybe this question fits into your answer just \u2013 how you just answered, Marika, because I would like to get maybe a bit more wording on EBIT margin guidance. You take it down by 2 percentage points compared to what you initially guided, around 1% or a little more than 1% is this warranty provision. The latter amount which is around \u2013 or the remaining part around 1 percentage point. Can you give some wording what that is underlying? And I expect it has something to do with what you just said, Marika. But please give some words on the guidance. Thanks."

         "Speaker": "Dan Togo"
      },
      "24": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So obviously, the 5% to 7% that we're guiding for is as a consequence of the warranty provision that is high and then also the COVID situation that we're in altogether. And then obviously, if I compare it to last year, and you also have an impact, we don't have any extraordinary income from development projects that you saw that has a big impact last year. But the two major is really the extraordinary warranty provision and the COVID-19 situation. And that's why we have taken down the EBIT guidance for the full year."

      },
      "25": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And then another question on the warranty provision, \u20ac175 million. Is this how you will consume that going forward? Will that be that run rate of around \u20ac30 million per quarter? And also the activity related to this, will this in any way, so to say, hamper or have a negative impact on how your activity would otherwise have developed? I mean do you need to dedicate a lot of resources to this? Thanks."

         "Speaker": "Dan Togo"

      "26": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, I think, obviously \u2013 I think Henrik said that earlier as well. I mean the process we go through when we provide for the warranties by no means random. So we have a process that we have followed altogether. We also made a thorough investigation in terms of coming up with the \u20ac175 million. So obviously, we know exactly what we're talking about and what it's relating to. I think what is very important is that the current blades and the forecasted blades going forward are not impacted.",
            "So it's a big number of blades, and therefore the high amount of \u20ac175 million, so that's clear. But obviously, as we're guiding for the same activity level as our original guidance, we're talking about \u20ac14 million to \u20ac15 million, we obviously see that we can do the two in combination. And I think that is the most important thing to highlight."

      "28": {
         "Remarks": [
            "No, but I think \u2013 that is, I think, more your assumption. We don't do the forecasting for next year. And obviously, what we're talking about now is the full year for 2020 and the activities regarding warranty is included in that guidance."

         "Remarks": [

Then obviously, you will have an impact on some delays in the revenue \u2013 on the revenue side. And obviously, that has also an impact on the EBIT.

And the question I have is that, by when do you expect that majority of these large orders that you announced will come from EnVentus?

I appreciate that you cannot specifically quantify the cost or the impact on costs in this quarter, but how do you see that \u2013 I mean, I know things are still quite uncertain, but given the current situation, how would you see that progressing through the remainder of this year? And also may be related to this is, has the company taken any specific restructuring measures to get \u2013 to garner some short-term savings? And if so, is there a potential reversal of this? Or are there some long-term saving plans which would offset this?"

Then obviously, we have calculated \u2013 as we've given you the guidance now, we have calculated for a COVID-19 situation to continue throughout the year. And obviously, no one, as I said earlier, have the silver bullet in terms of how the situation will pan out. But as we're giving a guidance for \u20ac14 million to \u20ac15 million here for the full year, obviously, we feel confident that we manage well in the circumstances that we are in.",

And obviously, you see impacts on suppliers, on transportation, on the overall logistics. But what we are calculating is really the direct cost when it comes to COVID-19, not the impact on our ability to supply to our customers. I think that's the best that we can give in our view on the COVID-19 situation. I don't think anyone has a silver bullet.

Vestas \u2013 MHI Vestas right now, of course, [indiscernible]. So do you think there is some technology that's lacking?

Given that last year we saw a lower margin in Q4, is that sort of seasonality which you expect? And effectively, is that the sort of new pattern for profitability that we expect, sort of first 3 quarters quite strong, with Q4 a little bit weaker margin? Or is your 25% effectively a floor given the strong margin you've seen in the first half? So that's the first question.",

Obviously, there is \u2013 it looks like we're setting up a very strong second half. Is most of that inventory build to be unwound during the second half? Or are you already building inventory for expectations of a strong 2021? Thank you."

So you can't really sort of use a 2019 pattern to say that there is uneven spread of quarterly profitability and others. We will take that quarter-by-quarter. And therefore, when we say its approx 25%, I always highlight both in terms of the organic growth and the EBIT here. Let's just appreciate that it's \u2013 every percent on that business is \u20ac20 million in round terms, which easily in a business that has more than 10,000 employees, it deviates.",

And especially, as you would appreciate, come on, these guys, colleagues out there, they are having a really tough time in getting all of this done on the very challenging conditions, considering you have to be in the field every day.

And yes, we have a very strong order intake, and we also have a very big order backlog that we have to fulfill. The only thing I can say is \u2013 to not sort of guide for next year, is that, obviously, if we have a high activity level in Q1 of next year, yes, we will most likely have to start building already in the latter part of the year. But the anticipation now, if I look at the overall inventory that we have at this point, we're obviously expecting a big part of that to be consumed now in the second half."

And I think here, when we comment on it quarter-by-quarter, some quarters, and I think it's fair saying when we looked at it last year, we also said probably not particularly impressed with the order intakes where we didn't succeed in taking orders. And therefore, in this quarter, it's really nice to see that its spread across countries like Vietnam, it's also Japan, there's some China, there's some Australia, India. And a couple of those markets are long-standing markets where we are having an established position, which is really pleased to see that we are still strengthening the existing position.",

We have an understanding of what's needed in the solutions. And therefore, it's nice to see that, especially in Japan and Vietnam, we can actually see that there is a traction from the local customers wanted to do more projects. So here, and as we have said \u2013 commented on the previous quarters, we are also same \u2013 following the same process, same discipline around profitability thresholds and targets. So that's nothing in reality and is then positive for the quarter.",

I mean we have several decades-long history in being a technology and quality leader in our industry. And we have no absolutely aspiration to change that vision. And therefore, we're also just saying it upfront here, there is a thing we need to address and we will be addressing that, and then we will do our normal robust process when we look at it.

And then I think Marika will address CapEx. And the buyback, we always say, listen, it's \u2013 with where we are at the year, we will always consider it, but we're also saying this year, with still the uncertainty and the caveat we put to our guidance, it's fair saying we will look at that when we are further into the second half of the year."

First of all, last year you had all the trade tariffs impacting your supply chain, this year COVID-19 is adding to those challenges. Given that, are you considering sort of any major changes to your supply chain, the way you do sourcing? Or is it more sort of happy with where you are?",
            "And secondly, on the order intake ASP of \u20ac0.78 million, I think that sort of leaves us with pretty much three years in a row where the ASP has been hovering around \u20ac0.75 million. Given that there are constantly technological improvements, is this really sort of a sign of the industry being able to increasingly hang on to those improvements itself rather than passing it on to customers? Thank you."

I think on the supply chain, I have to say it's difficult to sit here and have an idea of that you have to do any radical changes coming out of a quarter where we, together with everyone that works together, also on the external side with investors, have been able to do another manufacturing and shipped in excess of 4 gigawatts. So in total, we are nearly at 10 gigawatt for the first half of the year. ",
            "So I think here, it's much more the closeness and how people have been able to execute on that one. Clearly, if we look across it, it's not the easiest place to be being a global manufacturer, but you cannot be a global mature industry and not having a global footprint. So we are doing \u2013 I think we have done a lot really well here.",
            "So therefore, we will \u2013 as said, we will always optimize. You have seen a number of our initiatives. And some of those initiatives, you can also see from our guidance. Of course, the phasing in of some of those initiatives will benefit us in the second half of the year to a larger extent than they did in the first half of the year. So I think we are doing everything we can in all the initiatives we have to, over time, progress towards the 10% mark, which we have said and we still stick to.",
            "I think your comment on the ASP, we like stability in the ASP. We also fully appreciate it deviates quarter-on-quarter. And then I will say, I won't comment on the industry because, I think, you're trying to do a conclusion on behalf of the industry indicates that you're a long way away from right in terms of looking at the variances in profitability in the industry.",

Hence, when it's not coming down, it gives you an opportunity to capture a larger part of that improvement and put that into your profitability instead?"

So I think it has to be a combination of the two.",

So we say it here with a smile, we're positively over it. We like the stability. And if we were to increase it, we would also do that because it's all on our way to get to the 10% EBIT."

I wonder if you could discuss, is there any margin differential between the Vestas \u2013 so the Service contract on Vestas turbines versus those that you've secured on the multi-brand? I guess I'm wondering what's the main competitive point around the multi-brand, are you having to compete more on price versus your peers? Or is it very similar to the Vestas brand? Thanks."

So when I look at the Vestas brand, we have a very high scope. So we have \u2013 the vast majority is the AOM 5000. And obviously, there, you have a higher profitability because you also make more commitments under those contracts.",
            "And in the multi-brand, if I generalize, it's a bigger volume, but in \u2013 it's also a lower scope and lower complexibility, and therefore, you have a lower profitability on those. But that is really because of the \u2013 of the complexity and the large volume that you are anticipating under the multi-brand contracts. But you also \u2013 under those you have a mix. So it's not only low-scope contracts, you would see higher scope contracts as well. And then that would be treated in a similar way as the Vestas brand."

It would seem \u2013 given revenues haven't changed, it would seem there's an expectation of about \u20ac290 million lower EBIT now than under the old guidance. And we know \u20ac175 million of that pertains to warranty provisions. We know \u20ac30 million cumulative pertains to COVID costs in the past. What does the other \u20ac100 million pertain to? Is it expectation of COVID costs in H2? Or is there something else going on in there?",
            "And secondly, my question for you, Henrik, is that in your conversations with customers, what are they \u2013 the Green Deal is coming, but there's not really any granularity surrounding that. Capital is still very cheap, but consenting has been delayed by COVID and other issues. What are you hearing when you sit down with your customers on their plans? Are they frustrated that they can't move ahead with new projects? Or do they have more opportunity than they can manage?"

Obviously, the \u20ac175 million is part of the 5% to 7%, and you also have COVID impact on that. So those two are the biggest items when it comes to the deviation to the 7% to 9% that we put forward in February."

            "Okay. And in terms of the Green Deal, and I think on the general, I think Green Deal is, as we all speak about, is Europe. And I think as you would appreciate me saying in a quarter like this, we've taken 4.1 gigawatt of orders across 18 countries, and the two of it is in the previous quarters. I think it's fair saying everyone are fully dedicated, fully on board, trying to do more projects. And I think underlying, which is probably even more important, Mark, is that the trend \u2013 I don't think we have seen, maybe bar some initiatives in Mexico, but otherwise, the whole world having reality put forward either structures or ideas to further accelerate the green recovery as part of coming out of the COVID-19.",
            "So I think here, it's much more for any customer now to say, as you're rightly saying, access to capital is not limited despite the COVID and the financial and economic, you can say, recession-like conditions. But at least here, the access to the capital is there. And also the capital available from customers, utilities and global asset managers' infrastructure fund have probably never been bigger than it is today.",
            "So we generally see right now a different conversation, it's more like an acceleration and then, of course, also being ready to take further advantage of these structures. You have seen, for instance, a new country like Vietnam suddenly extending their policies and other. So there's a lot of countries that will come up as new countries, positive markets for Vestas, to compete in, in the future as well. So the glass is more than half full."

I think coming into this set of results, a lot of people were anticipating that COVID-19 would have an impact on revenue this year and there would be some delay of revenues from 2020 into 2021. Obviously, the guidance you've given today implies that your ability to install and recognize revenue this year isn't actually going to be impacted by the pandemic at all. So do you have any initial comments or initial color about how we should be thinking about volumes and revenues into 2021?",

So in reality here, when we look at it, we don't sit and plan now for a carryover from 2020 or 2021, we try to get as much we can, execute it in 2020 accordingly to the plans. Some then comes with either new things and maybe even projects that can be advanced against maybe one or two delays in other things.",

And we are \u2013 as I said, here, we have a good visibility to it. But of course, also with the challenges that will clearly also come from time to time in the second half of the year due to the COVID-19.",

We see repowering in the Americas, especially in North America. We also see repowering in Europe. Because with the technology development we have had in the last decade, it's obvious, very attractive to do that and we will also start seeing repowering. There is a conversation now, also, for instance, in countries like China and others where we will start having an attention and a focus on the repowering from those.

            "So the question is, by now, with the tariffs and the trade situation which appears to be a new normal, have you adopted and changed your supply chain to what might be a new normal? I.e., I mean could we see that the supply chain cost will perhaps go down going into next year given sort of a more stable situation? I realize, of course, that the COVID-19 still is cause for some concern and uncertainty on that part. That's the first one."

So that means we are simply just adjusting and saying this is the conditions we are working under. You will also see in our guidance for the second half of the year, we are leaning into that second half of the year and the execution of it, where we are taking advantage of the supply chain.",

You have seen sort of a gradual increase of the warranty provisions, looking aside the \u20ac175 million of course, over the past many quarters. And you've been arguing that launching the new EnVentus platform is part of the reason.",

So what we have said here is that we work diligently and when we introduce new things, we will always provide prudently for it. And as also Marika mentioned earlier on, if we bar the issue we've had here around the warranty set aside to the blades, then we will return to normal levels of provisioning as well as you've seen. So that varies.",
