         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I\u2019m here with Silvana Travaglini, Chief Financial Officer of Stella-Jones. Thank you for joining us for this discussion of the financial and operating results for Stella Jones\u2019s Second Quarter ended June 30, 2020. Our press release reporting Q2 results was published earlier this morning. It along with our MD&A can also be found on our website at www.stellajones.com and will be posted on SEDAR today as well.",
         "Let me remind you that all figures expressed on today\u2019s call are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. Let me begin by thanking each and every one of our 2,300 employees across North America, who have worked diligently and safely to ensure the critical continuity of our essential operations and support our customers throughout the pandemic. With the exceptional contribution from the team and proven resiliency of our business model, we delivered record results this quarter. We realized solid performances in our utility pole and railway tie product categories which continued their growth momentum from the first quarter and benefited from exceptional demand from residential lumber stemming from increased home improvement activity in the context of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Sales grew 15% this quarter compared to the same quarter last year to CAD768 million and EBITDA increased 28% to CAD120 million, surpassing the CAD100 million mark for the first time in a single quarter. During the quarter, we generated strong cash from operations, which allowed us to reduce our leverage and position the company to continue to deliver value to our shareholders.",
         "Let me now turn to a brief overview of our second quarter sales results by product category. Utility pole sales amounted to CAD230 million, up from CAD211 million generated in the second quarter of 2019. The increase this quarter is primarily driven by upward price adjustments in response to raw material cost increases. Raw \u2013 railway tie sales increase to CAD225 million, up from CAD199 million in the same period last year. Excluding the currency conversion effect, sales rose 10% as certain Class 1 customers accelerated their 2020 maintenance program while demand remained strong for non-Class 1 customers supported by a healthy level of untreated tie inventory. Residential lumber sales totaled CAD257 million, up 32% from CAD195 million generated last year. This significant increase in sales is attributable to greater than expected volumes as a result of a strong home improvement activity in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial product sales amounted to CAD33 million, down 6% from CAD35 million recorded in the previous year\u2019s quarter primarily as a result of lower piling project activities. The sales of logs and lumber, a product category used to optimize procurement was CAD23 million, down from CAD27 million last year. Sales decreased given the limited market supply of lumber.",
         "Silvana will now provide further details regarding our results and financial position before I conclude with our 2020 outlook. Silvana?",
         "Thank you, Silvana. We revised our earnings guidance for 2020 to reflect our strong operating performance this quarter largely driven by the greater than expected demand for residential lumber. As a result, we now expect EBITDA for 2020 to be in the range of CAD320 million to CAD345 million, up CAD20 million from the previously disclosed guidance. The lower end of the range continues to reflect uncertain impact of the pandemic on customer demand. We also expect the EBITDA margin to be comparable to 2019. This revised guidance assumes an exchange rate of 1.38 for the balance of the year. The 2020 CapEx guidance remains the same as previously disclosed in the range of CAD45 million to CAD55 million.",
         "The company\u2019s strategic vision focused on continental expansion remains intact and acquisitions continue to be an integral part of this growth strategy. Our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is active and we are in discussion with several identified targets across North America but certain but the current context is creating certain headwinds. We remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders. As part of our capital allocation approach the company intends to target a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio between 2x and 2.5x. This target leverage ratio should allow us to return capital to shareholders and take advantage of internal growth and acquisition opportunities, while maintaining a healthy financial position.",
         "This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be pleased to answer any questions you may have."

         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Stella-Jones Q2 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions. [Operator Instructions]",
         "Before turning the meeting over to management, please be advised that this conference call will contain statements that are forward-looking and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded on Wednesday, August 5, 2020.",
         "I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Vachon, President and CEO. Please go ahead."

      "Silvana Travaglini": [
         "Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. Turning to profitability, driven by the strong sales growth this quarter gross profit increased 21% to a CAD131 million compared to gross profit of CAD108 million in the second quarter last year. Similarly, operating income and EBITDA increased 31% and 28% to CAD101 million and CAD120 million respectively. This increase is largely attributable to strong pressure-treated wood demand particularly for residential lumber and pricing improvements, which more than offset the rising raw material costs. Net income rose 33% for the second quarter to CAD69 million or CAD1.02 per share compared to CAD52 million or CAD0.76 per share last year.",
         "Turning to liquidity and capital resources, cash flow generated from operating activities totaled CAD146 million in the second quarter largely explained by improved profitability and the seasonal reduction in inventory, which was amplified this quarter by very strong residential lumber sales. We deployed the cash generated to invest in our network, return capital to our shareholders through dividends, and reduce our long-term debt. As of June 30, 2020, the net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA ratio decreased to 1.9x and we had access to CAD205 million in liquidity, through a combination of cash on hand, syndicated credit facilities, and an un-drawn demand facility. Given the strength of our balance sheet today Stella-Jones announced a Normal Course Issuer Bid, which will allow us to repurchase up to 2.5 million shares representing 3.7% of our outstanding common shares from August 10, 2020, to August 9, 2021. In addition, consistent with previous quarters the Board of Directors yesterday declared a quarterly dividend of CAD0.15 per share payable on September 18, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 1st.",
         "I will now turn the call back to Eric for the outlook. Eric?"

            "Good morning. Eric, just on the \u2013 again obviously very strong quarter, I guess my question is just around the guidance, if at the midpoint, you would imply roughly flat EBITDA in the back half, whereas you were up north of 25% in Q2. So maybe just trying to understand sort of the puts and takes or sort of what\u2019s in the guidance or how you are thinking about that as to reconcile the difference between the two periods?"

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, certainly. So I think the way to look at the range in this particular context, is to see the lower end as being I guess negatively impacted or continue to be impacted by the current pandemic and uncertain economic conditions. And we could view, there was a higher range of the guidance, more return to historical \u2013 historical demand and business activity. That\u2019s the best way I could describe it. So using the middle point might not necessarily be the best way to look at it depending on how the general economy and the pandemic evolves in the next 6 months."

Just to help us again get a better sense of quarter, the quarter and I guess recent trends, maybe just talk about the pace of improvement or sort of the cadence through the quarter of demand through your various product lines. I am just I guess I am curious if residential is tapering off a bit or flattening out? And then just trying to get a better again, understanding of ties where you have talked about sort of maintenance activity being pulled forward sort of what that means for the back half?"

         "Remarks": [
            "No, sorry the \u2013 yes, through the quarter and I guess into July sort of the pace of improvements across ties and residential if again it sort of moderated a bit sort of you spoke to some pull forward in ties. So I was thinking the quarter of July but if you want to talk in the second half, that would be good as well?"

         "Speaker": "Mark Neville"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So, I mean during the quarter, if you go product category one at a time. So for utility poles, as we indicated, most of the growth has come from year-over-year pricing which was driven to some extent by increased costs related to the products. What we\u2019ve seen with regards from demand from customers a lot of well certain utilities across North America have been cautious in deploying their maintenance crews in the context of the pandemic, and that has curtailed the demand to a certain extent for certain utilities. So, that has slowly been resolving itself throughout the quarter. If I think about in early April to what we\u2019re seeing today that has the volume piece has improved. With regards to the railway business, the railway tie sales were positively impacted from pull-forward from certain Class 1, as they saw an opportunity with lower traffic on their network to not to bring maintenance forward. That being said, in general terms, Class 1s have not necessarily changed their annual program if you answer it\u2019s essentially taking Q3, Q4 sales into the second quarter. We\u2019re just, we\u2019re always grateful to see our expectation on sales materialize in this case materialize a bit earlier. We also saw healthy demand in the non-Class 1 business as there has been significant \u2013 has been significant quoting activity in the first half of the year. So it has been very, very interesting for us and we\u2019re very fortunate to have proper levels of untreated ties to be able to support the demand. Last but not least, the residential lumber as our results showed this morning demand has been very strong throughout the second quarter. I would say we actually depleted some of our finished good inventories and looking forward our customers are telling us that they still see some healthy demand going forward into H2."

            "Okay. Maybe just two quick follow-ups, so, the pricing in poles is that, can you just, is that something that we continue to the second half, again just based on prices are up year-over-year and then just on the residential just confirm it, it doesn\u2019t really sound like the demand has tapered off, but just maybe just want a clarification on that? And that\u2019s it. Thanks."

I guess maybe flattish or slightly up, but the demand has not tapered off and the costs or the pricing dynamics will really depend on a case by case so depending on the actual agreement but most often it is driven by the cost profile of the products and also the profile of the product that the customers ordering."

But as we are now preparing our \u201820/21 budget and thinking about starting a procurement program for inventories for next year.

So that\u2019s the best way I can describe it for now and this is based on what our customers are indicating."

I mean most cases are purchasing white lumber on the market. So they understand the challenges we have in the current context. So you are right that in the second half of the year, we could see some effect on being attributable to pricing."

Just curious as to what was the area, it sounds like it was residential lumber but you tell me what was the area of the biggest delta in terms of what you were expecting 3 months ago and what\u2019s happening here today? And is that visibility improved now, now that we are a little bit in the third quarter here as you give guidance for the rest of the year or are you in kind of the same situation where things can change abruptly to lead to that \u2013 that led to that guidance change?"

         "Remarks": [
            "So you are completely right, the bump. The major part of the bump of the guidance comes from the strong performance from residential lumber. So based off of our previous forecast, we need to acknowledge the great results we had this year, and I don\u2019t expect to pull back on residential lumber, in the back half of the year. That being said, my comment with regards to our guidance on the, let\u2019s say that the lower end of the range being potentially impacted by coronavirus. It really depends on how things will play out as we are seeing cases increase in the U.S. where we see more lockdowns or where we see some pullbacks. As I mentioned certain utilities are very cautious with their employees. So that\u2019s I guess to the lower part of the range that the higher part of the range is that from Labor Day we see cases drop and we know a lot of our customers have plans and projects were maintenance and it just depends we really feel comfortable enough to be able to execute it. Safe to say that I strongly believe in the guidance we provide today and I really sincerely believe that we will realize \u2013 we will realize our guidance in the second half of the year."

So I am just curious whether the pull forward we have seen is now completely done and again back to the question on lumber, are you assuming some kind of bearish scenario in your high-end of your guidance here, because as it looks from this point forward, it seems like given you have done, you are trending at above 25% for the rest of the year, you could probably do better than 4% for second quarter \u2013 or second half?"

We did see pull forward in railway tie sales into the second quarter. So obviously those are sales. The downside of that will come in the second half of the year. So that\u2019s also part of the consideration."

If we look at the impact of COVID-19 and the gyrations from pulling forward and all of that, is \u2013 is it safe to take to take \u2013 to take your 2020. Is there anything wrong with taking 2019 and putting your long-term growth rates that you had back then in each of these divisions to come up with a 2021 number. Is that how we should look at 2021 or could there be a lower level of activity in 2021 because of the pull in the revenue that was pulled into 2020?"

One thing I believe is the current pandemic context has demonstrated our strength as a Company especially in the residential lumber business. We show the strength of our vendor network to supply raw material. We have shown our customers our ability to continue to deliver and to produce and I think we will get some tailwinds out of that next year as we are demonstrating that, we are \u2013 I would like to believe that we are departed at a lot of retailers we should be partnering up with. So I guess there is that aspect to it and after that I mean for the other product categories we are always [indiscernible] you are correct and I would expect if volumes don\u2019t entirely resume for utility pole this year we should see things, hopefully, get better by the end of the year and hit a bit of a normalized trend or growth trend into 2021."

            "Thank you, Benoit. That\u2019s a great question. So you are completely right, demand from our customers in the second quarter was very strong and we did have to dip into our finished good inventory reserve if you want to call it to be able to satisfy demand. As I mentioned earlier, we have a very strong vendor supply group outstanding people that are willing to support Stella-Jones. We today have a constant flow, daily flow of what wood raw material coming into our plants. We are currently pushing the capacity to be able to treat the inventory and supply the market. So I am quite confident when I talk about us being able to exceed the volumes of 2019 in the second half of 2020. It really stems from my confidence in our procurement team to be able to procure sufficient wood in our operations into the go-to-treat it. That being said, we are very mindful about finishing the year with healthy inventory levels to be able to address the 2021 year with regards to residential lumber. So that\u2019s top of mind and right now there is no indication that we will not be able to achieve that."

Obviously in the second half, with all the residential lumber sales being so strong, there will be a significant inflow, so that might change a little bit, but just generally, we were still \u2013 we are still targeting and forecasting that amount.

So I guess for the Class 1 maintenance programs you need, I guess we need to look at the whole year maintenance program really to appreciate what happens with the volume there. The other piece of it is really the non-Class 1 where that environment is getting very competitive on the pricing. So, both are competitive in the sense of obtaining the winning the quotes and then again seeing some pressure because a lot of treaters in this case, the smaller treaters in the industry that have don\u2019t have Class 1 contracts are aggressively treating to get business."

And then on the upper end like I am just not sure, is that a kind of a continuation of what you\u2019re seeing or there are some \u2013 there is some negativity and caution built into the upper-end as well around potential lockdowns or sort of?"

The upper end of the range, also has a bit of conservatism, as if I use it as a starting point, we would see things progressively get better in the next few months, so obviously, we\u2019d hit our stride later in the second half of the year.

To this day, I was talking earlier about you know certain utilities in North America being prudent with the maintenance program because of wanting to protect the safety of their employees. We\u2019re still seeing certain utilities still you know slowly getting out of that modes. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m referring to things picking up gradually. So cases, I mean cases in Canada have increased a bit, but there is sort of hopefully stabilizing, but we are seeing cases in the U.S. increased, but it seems like the U.S. economy is determined to want to take off and to keep supporting activity. It\u2019s just very hard to read, where it\u2019s going to go. So I guess, you know we didn\u2019t want to come out and be fully bullish that after Labor Day we are back to historical levels and we\u2019ll be doing all of this great percentage of growth.

So like just, again, just to be clear, you\u2019re building in some uncertainty and some risks. But thus far you have not really been affected by that to a material degree. Is that fair to say?"

The second quarter obviously got positively impacted by the residential number. But as I mentioned, we did see some softening on volume, on the volume side for utility poles and we\u2019re fortunate to see a pull forward on the railway ties.

All these great things, you know, it\u2019s a great first half of the year, but I don\u2019t want to abstract the fact that we\u2019re still living in a world where there\u2019s Coronavirus and certain economic pullback and either I\u2019m just being cautious and considering those aspects."

We still believe that we want to keep our employees safe and we\u2019re not allowing our employees to flight, they can definitely drive. So depending on who we\u2019re talking to make things a bit more complicated, but now the current context in certain regions of North America also make it more complicated to get consultants out to the different facilities to support due diligence and the M&A process. So, I would sort of agree to what you just said, hopefully, give you a bit more insight there."

Is there anything going on right now in terms of cost pressures that you see as sort of potentially threatening the margins or that you don\u2019t see an ability to offset through pass this?"

Is that simply to have in place and therefore to be opportunistic with if you see an opportunity that you think represents good value or is the idea to be quite active with that into essentially try to \u2013 try to fully utilize that buyback?"

            "Good. Well, thank you for asking that question. It gives me the chance to give a bit more insight on the thought process. So as Silvana explained. And we disclosed our net debt to EBITDA leverage midyear is sitting at 1.9 which for mid-year for us is pretty, actually, pretty low. We usually see that occur more at year-end. So looking forward with our healthy free cash flow that should \u2013 that will be upcoming in the next, in the next few months, we sell that if we want to keep a certain leverage on our balance sheet at the NCIB will be a great opportunity to have in place and to be able to use to your point, opportunistically, to be able to make proper use of our free cash flow or available cash and thus return the value to shareholders. That being said, if an M&A opportunity presents itself we\u2019d be very much willing to lever above the range that we discuss knowing very well that our cash flow will help us replenish it. So I guess it\u2019s another tool in the box for us to be able to deploy capital."
