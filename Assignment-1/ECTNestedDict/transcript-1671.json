      "Enrique Beltranena": [
         "Thank you, Maria Elena, and thank you very much for -- everybody for joining us. I hope everyone is healthy. I want to start by giving a special mention to our family of ambassadors and our Board members who have been fully committed to the company through their service, passion and dedication during this difficult situation, which has certainly proven to be historic.",
         "We have taken the following five core actions to address the impact of COVID-19 in a rigorous way. We, first, diligently managed our liquidity position. Second, we delivered a conservative plan to face the impacts of the COVID-19 with growth flexibility. Third, we achieved a fast recovery in terms of capacity. As Holger will further elaborate, there are five main reasons that explain, why Volaris was able to ramp-up to 60% of its capacity in July, and now 70% for August versus the originally published schedule. The first one is the strength of our VFR traffic operated in a point-to-point network, which is the market segment that has recovered in the fattest way. The second is a strong domestic Mexican leisure market recovery. The third, a very active bus switching marketing campaign. And the fourth, less competition in the Mexican market. And finally, the fifth one, a deeper reduction -- cost reduction initiatives, which have strengthened our ultra-low cost structure.",
         "And then the COVID-19 provided the opportunity to further reduce costs. For the last year and half, the company has worked on its cost structure to become the lowest unit cost operator in the Americas, and is now amongst the lowest cost airlines, or unit cost airlines in the world. We have seized an opportunity in the current crisis to strengthen our cost structure. Specifically, we have negotiated cost reductions with more than 360 suppliers, and have temporary switched material fixed payment agreement to a variable scheme.",
         "Additionally, a lower labor contract is based on a variable compensation per hour. In sum, a lower and more variable costs structure will allow the company to better withstand the pressure revenue environment and provide a greater ability to ramp-up.",
         "Finally, as I said, we implemented safety and health measures. Operational quality and safety are fundamental in this moment. We are encompassing all our efforts to ensure the well-being of Volaris' personnel and passengers. We have implemented and actively communicated the new biosecurity and preventive measures so that we can continue to offer the best travel experience. We will continue to update our protocols and adopt best international practices to guarantee safety.",
         "But let me pass it over to our Airline Executive Vice President, Holger Blankenstein, to comment on revenues and on the commercial strategy that we've been implementing to ramp-up. Holger, please. ",
         "Thank you very much, Jaime. Volaris continues supporting national volunteer entities. We have transported health equipment and continue carrying medical personnel as part of our Aviona user [ph] program. The company has taken every action in response to the current contingency in order to facilitate our ramp up process. We are not hesitating to make difficult decisions to ensure the long-term success of our airline.",
         "We're confident that if we continue preserving our cash, operating with our new fleet delivery and predelivery payment schedule, managing the rental agreements; salaries and benefits, and above all, taking measures to oversee our ambassadors' and our customers' safety, the company will remain placed at the ahead of the runway.",
         "Now our focus is on taking off and ramping up the business through the lowest fares in the market and getting back customers' demand and as a result of recovery on ASMs proceeds. The company has an ultra-low cost business model with an unparalleled competitive position. We're fully determined to take all opportunities presented in the market.",
         "I do not want to finish today thanking the entire Volaris family for their tireless efforts and commitment in the challenging environment. But there's also a big group of people that I want to thank you. I want to express my deep gratitude to our resource, our financiers and to all our suppliers and business partners who have been supported to the company through this crisis. They believe in our business model, but most important than anything, they believe in our values.",
         "We treasure these long-term relationships and will always remember their comprehensive collaboration in this challenging time. This management is more than ever committed to succeed. Thank you very much.",
         "Operator, would you please open the line for analysts for questions? "
      ],
      "Holger Blankenstein": [
         "Thank you, Enrique. The second quarter had an extremely challenging macro environment, and despite that, we achieved the following top line figures. The number of passengers booked in the second quarter was 1.1 million, with a healthy load factor. In domestic market, the booked load factor was 77.8%. In the international market, it was 86.3%. The capacity reductions in April and May resulted in high load factors, and we did observe a high percentage of no shows in some markets. Due to the no shows, the average onboard load was 60% for the period.",
         "TRASM for the second quarter reached $0.047, with a year-on-year decrease of 34%. Total ancillary revenue per passenger reached Ps.644 for the quarter, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Ancillaries now account for 46.6% of total operating revenues, driven by resiliency in non-air ancillaries such as the co-branded credit card. However, total ancillaries decreased 76% year-over-year, due to the reductions in capacity.",
         "In terms of operational reliability, on-time performance was 95.7% for the second quarter. The second quarter of 2020 was characterized by three very different months. In April and May, the demand fell and required significant capacity cuts. This trend was reversed in June, when Volaris was able to start increasing its capacity, taking advantage of early signs of recovery, particularly in the domestic market. Despite low levels of operations in June, Volaris' ramp-up was significantly faster than that of our domestic competitors.",
         "In April 2020, Volaris operated 18% ASMs versus the same period of 2019. In May, this fell further to 12%, whereas in June, Volaris operated 41%; a ramp-up of more than 230% compared to May 2020.",
         "The domestic market held up better than the international markets and Central America remained closed altogether. For the ramp-up in June and further into the third quarter, Volaris has taken a breadth over depth approach to network recovery, focusing on marginal contribution of flights. By the end of June 2020, service restarted in 49% of domestic routes and 22% of U.S. markets, albeit both at a lower frequency versus 2019.",
         "In the second quarter, because we had excess capacity marginal contribution was used as the main metric when making capacity decisions as cash flow takes priority. In addition, we extended our schedule publication out to October 2021 to help cash inflows.",
         "On the sales side, this was supported by heavy promotional activities to further push advanced sales. We announced five new domestic routes from Mexico City to the following cities: Torren, Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche, Tampico and Villahermosa. ",
         "For the third quarter, we expect a gradual ramp-up of operations with 60% of capacity operated in July and approximately 70% to be operated in August versus the same period last year. This represents an increase of 55% of capacity compared to the second quarter of 2020. As of today, Volaris has 229 daily operations in 39 domestic and 16 international airports.",
         "Again, we have proven that the ULCC model is the most effective in the market. Now more than ever, we have the opportunity to compete directly with buses, while also backfilling capacity left unserved by other airlines that are reducing their operations. While we have a weak economy in the U.S. and Mexico, low airfares become even more important.",
         "Our ultra-low cost structure allows us to offer low base fares through a point-to-point network. This gives us an unparalleled competitive position that supports our market leadership. Regarding customer segments, we observed some key trends. DRF markets have seen the fastest recovery, followed by leisure, whilst business routes remain depressed.",
         "VFR and leisure routes also have seen a better recovery in fares, while business route base fares have recovered much less. As a case in point, VFR customers don't need to stay in hotels because they are staying with friends and family, so they are much more likely to venture out. This traffic has been relatively strong in previous crisis as well.",
         "As for the leisure traveler, a trip to the beach cannot be replaced by a video conference call. We also carry cost-conscious entrepreneurs of small and medium-sized enterprises. This traffic has also performed relatively well. The VFR and price-sensitive leisure segments are Volaris' core customer segments, which positions us much better in a recovery.",
         "We remain focused on embracing growth opportunities in current markets, new geographies and ancillary revenues. We strongly believe that this crisis is handing us a once in a lifetime opportunity to rapidly move our business forward for the benefit of our customers and shareholders.",
         "As mentioned in the last earnings call, we have significantly advanced on digital initiatives. We have seized the opportunity to implement some key technology advancements to better position us for the ramp-up. We have upgraded to the latest version of New Skies, the Navitaire reservation platform. We have launched a new volaris.com with a similar experience, faster load times, additional functionalities and more flexibility. This also includes a new web progressive app, ideally suited for entry-level smartphones.",
         "We have adopted our digital platform and web services to satisfy our currently overwhelmed call centers. For example, by adding WhatsApp and other messaging functionalities that bypass the call center.",
         "We have reinforced communication to direct customers to the web and guide them through the flight online change process. These upgrades complement our bus switching and VFR strategies by making it easier for customers in those segments to book and execute via their mobile phone.",
         "Another important part of the ramp-up of operations has been to give passengers piece of mind when traveling with Volaris. In May, we launched a comprehensive communications campaign entitled con Volaris Seguro vuelas, which is based on three brand promises: number one, safety through a reinforced biosecurity protocol; second, more flexibility via an ancillary combo that offers unlimited changes; and third, affordable airfares that compete with buses.",
         "In the last few months -- the last few months have been a big burden on the customer service team due to a large increase in volumes for flight changes, cancellations and voucher issuance. In the early days of the quarter, we did not always achieve the service levels we strive for. We quickly adopted more self-service technologies and improved service levels.",
         "For flight cancellations due to our capacity decreases, we have been offering the customers alternative options, of which the most popular has been a travel voucher for 125% of the original purchase price. This has also helped our cash balance.",
         "Since March 15 until June 30, over 535,000 changes have been made by customers themselves on volaris.com and another 372,000 were made through the call center. This means that approximately two-third of our customers' interactions were fully automized.",
         "In the second quarter, Volaris has issued electronic vouchers with a value of approximately 6% of last 12-month sales. From this amount, 9% have already been redeemed by customers.",
         "We believe that Volaris is well-positioned for the recovery based on experiences in Asia and Europe. For the year end of 2020, we currently expect the Mexican domestic market demand as a whole to reach 65% to 75% of last year's levels. While we have no better insight at this moment and, therefore, cannot exactly predict the pace of the recovery, Volaris has prepared itself commercially, operationally and financially to take every opportunity that we can.",
         "In summary, ultra-low costs, many of them variable, give us a greater ability to withstand a pressured revenue environment. As we ramp-up, we are working on recovering the productivity of fleet measured in ASMs per aircraft per day. This will improve CASM during the recovery.",
         "We service customer segments that have proven more resilient and that are recovering faster than other segments, helped by remittances to Mexico that jumped to its second highest level in May since records began in 1995.",
         "Volaris refreshed its digital platforms by taking advantage of the slowdown and to be ready for the recovery by highlighting our super low fares. We have doubled down on bus switching campaigns in order to split the advantage of traveling by airplane during the health emergency; faster, healthier and less expensive.",
         "Buses may have poor ventilation and hygiene measures and an aging fleet. 40% of Volaris routes before the pandemic had no air competition with just direct bus competition. The Mexican bus market is about 70 times the size of the domestic air traffic market. Volaris will not spare any efforts to convert bus travelers.",
         "And there are also new opportunities emerging to operate more in previously capacity constrained airports. New opportunities are also opening up in Central America. Volaris will not spare any efforts to tackle profitable opportunities. These factors have already resulted in a strong market position for Volaris. Before the pandemic, Volaris domestic market share was around 30%, whereas, in June it had grown to approximately 50%.",
         "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jaime Pous, to discuss our financial performance for the quarter."
      ],
      "Jaime Pous": [
         "Thank you, Holger. Now, I will continue the discussion of our results in accordance with the figures filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores.",
         "Let me start by saying that it has been a pleasure to be involved in the finance field during this challenging period with such talented Volaris colleagues. A summary of what our team has achieved in the last three months is as follows.",
         "Total operating revenues for the second quarter reached Ps.1.5 billion, representing a decrease of 82% versus 2019. Our focus was on operating all flights with marginal contribution to preserve cash.",
         "During the second quarter, CASM ex-fuel was US$0.1003. Total U.S. dollar CASM was US$0.1174, an increase of 80% versus 2019, driven by our required lower aircraft utilization to minimize variable costs and preserve cash.",
         "The second quarter of the year delivered an operating loss of Ps.2.3 billion, a negative operating margin of 154%. Please note that IFRS requires the company to fully recognize all expenses in the original contractual month on an accrual basis, notwithstanding, repayment deferrals that we have obtained.",
         "EBITDA in the second quarter was negative Ps.470 million, an EBITDA margin of negative 30.8%. We reported a net loss for the second quarter of Ps.1.6 billion with a negative net margin of 107.7%.",
         "The exchange rate depreciation at the end of the second quarter led to a non-cash FX net gain of Ps.1.1 billion below the operating line due to our net U.S. dollar monetary liability position.",
         "Despite the reduction in revenues, during the second quarter, the net cash flow generated by operating activities was Ps.584 million. Net cash flow used in investing activities reached Ps.71 million. The net cash flow used in financing activities was Ps.1.2 billion. For the first half of the year, Volaris had operating cash flow generation of the Ps.3.4 billion.",
         "Volaris has the strongest balance sheet profile amongst the Mexican carriers. At the end of the second quarter, the company registered a negative net debt of Ps.4.6 billion, excluding the liability recognized under the IFRS 16 adoption.",
         "This is explained by three factors, a non-restricted cash level of Ps.10 million, a short-term working capital facility of only Ps.200 million. And the third, a guarantee revolving financial line for pre-delivery payments established for fleet replacement and expansion, of Ps.3.7 billion and a local bond of Ps.1.5 billion.",
         "The company doesn't have any debt amortization payments, due this year, for its local bond. There are no principal payments due in the next 10 months. And the company has their resources to service all its contractual obligations. Volaris net debt-to-EBITDA ratio closed the second quarter at 5.2 times, reflecting a healthy and solid balance sheet as per the industry standard. Volaris' financial debt is used solely to invest in the business.",
         "Our fuel expense line during the quarter continues to benefit from the recent global drop in jet fuel prices, despite the fuel hedge position previously placed. Addressing liquidity, as of June 30th, cash and cash equivalents were Ps.10 billion, representing 35% of last 12 months of operating revenues.",
         "Despite the existing liquidity of the company, we believe that increasing our cash position will allow us to take advantage of unprecedented opportunities. Consequently, in the next 18 months, we will be evaluating various opportunistic financing alternatives.",
         "Since the COVID-19 contingency started, our main objective has been to preserve the company's liquidity position. As Enrique mentioned, we have implemented a liquidity preservation plan, which has reduced a total of Ps. 6.1 billion, through payment deferrals and cost reduction for 2020. Around Ps.1.6 billion were deferred to 2021.",
         "We have reduced capital expenditures to a minimum and cut nonessential expenses for the rest of the year. As a result of our agreement with Airbus, which defers 20 aircraft into 2027 and 2028, we postponed $200 million in pre-delivery payments originally scheduled, for 2020, 2021 and 2022.",
         "Additionally, our new contract for fleet plan with Airbus, allow us to maintain a cautious fleet that will remain at 87 aircraft, net of new entrants and deliveries, until 2023. Our main PDPs requirements during the second half of 2021 and 2022 are covered through our financing facility with Santander and Bancomext.",
         "Specifically, for the second quarter, our liquidity preservation plan provided Ps. 2.2 billion in benefits, of which Ps.357 million were cost avoidance and the rest repayment deferrals.",
         "The company doubled its number of payable days on hand, as a result of its liquidity preservation plan. Through the scrutiny of our treasury world room, we minimized our cash burn. For the third quarter, we expect our monthly cash burn to average between $40 million and $45 million.",
         "In the face of this industry disruption, the company is not providing guidance on earnings. We will, however, intensify our already strong effort to preserve cash and to continue finding and implementing additional cost-cutting measures.",
         "Now I'll pass it back to Enrique for closing remarks."

Now that you're ramping to 60% in July, 70% in August, and I don't know if you mentioned September, how are loads holding up? I assume you're not going to have as many no shows, so maybe the right comparison is versus the 60% onboard load factor in 2Q."

We have seen a shift in terms of the months depending on the velocity. And basically, it's driven by -- remember that with the vouchers we are giving up 25% over what they pay. And also, people are buying either on the really short term because I'm going to fly tomorrow because I need it.

In the domestic market, the market capacity has gone down by at least 76 aircraft which is 25% of the market fleet. So there's been significant capacity reduction and that clearly opens up some opportunity in Mexico City because two of the main competitors operate more than 80% of their capacity from Mexico -- used to operate more than 80% of their capacity from Mexico City. So precisely, we are looking at some opportunities. We have announced five new routes from Mexico City to some of the Gulf destinations in the Gulf of Mexico. So, that's the first step in that process."

Just to follow up on Duane's Mexico City question, Holger, so as Aeromexico and ENERGEN have cut back service there it's obviously created opportunities for you. But now with respect to it being a slot-constrained airport, are those time channels that you end up using for the new flights, can you ultimately keep those? Or do they have to be given back when those other carriers decide to add back service? Can you just talk about the mechanism? I know some airports have these use it or lose it rules. And then some have -- some carriers have been granted exemptions from using all of their slots given the severity of COVID-19, some color on that would be great? "

            "No, that makes sense, that if it's the same year-over-year with the market having contracted as much it's obviously a relatively much larger footprint there than what you had in the past versus the competition. So that's helpful and which leads me to actually one another question. The fact that you are now taking bookings through October of 2021. I mean we are well beyond the 330 days. And I think that is unique. I'm not sure if I've ever actually seen an airline book well beyond a year. And I'm curious number one, are all the systems out there in which you could potentially book the ticket I guess maybe it doesn't even matter since most -- I think you're mostly in-house anyway. So maybe anything that you can talk about on a technology basis and maybe it's completely irrelevant since you're able to do it mostly in-house. I'm just curious about what the take rates are for people buying tickets in September and October of 2021? Again, I just I've never seen it before, any color or commentary around that would be very interesting? "

Presumably that's not sustainable longer-term. That's more of just a distortion of the fact that you're just -- you're driving relatively low levels of passenger revenue.

So yes, we are trying to get to high booked load factors, but cash flow takes priority in this situation. And we're putting back in capacity where we think we can make marginal contribution. Again with the depth -- breadth-versus-depth approach to market recovery. So we're going to try to reschedule some of the routes that we have had albeit at lower frequencies than in 2019, so that we have the footprint. We are recovering the footprint as fast as possible."

For example in June 2020, domestic market recovery was about 19% versus the U.S. market recovery was about 10% for the market as a whole. And that is also reflected in our capacity allocation. We are allocating a lot more capacity to the domestic specifically Tijuana and Guadalajara than to the trans-border market.",
