         "Thanks, Trent, and thank you to everyone for joining the call. As a reminder, last quarter, we took a new approach to managing these calls. We published a detailed letter to shareholders on our Investor Relations website and used our time on the conference call to address your questions. We received positive feedback on that approach. So we\u2019re doing the same approach this morning. As Trent mentioned, our letter to shareholders was posted on our IR website earlier this morning.",
         "I\u2019d like to give just a few comments, and we can get right to your questions. First, I\u2019ve been consistently amazed at how well our team has executed in this challenging period. Despite material headwinds in certain product categories and the difficulties of a remote work environment, our team remains especially focused on optimizing every aspect of our business in the near term while continuing to innovate and drive better outcomes for consumers and our partners over the long haul.",
         "In addition to terrific execution, our better-than-expected quarter results are a testament to the flexibility of our model and the durability of this company. And with the recent financing activity we just completed in July, our balance sheet is particularly strong, leaving us well positioned to capitalize on the accelerating evolution of Consumer Finance.",
         "And with that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

            "So, just a couple of questions. On the consumer segment, it looks like most of the card issuers are back. That\u2019s basically what we\u2019ve been hearing from some channel checks. And I think even in your letter you kind of talked about that. But their level of spend is still obviously very depressed. One, what kind of KPIs are they kind of waiting for to kind of increase their spend? Is it just really just all macro? And second, anything you can do on your end to kind of sweeten the deal, so to speak, to maybe get them to commit more spending. And lastly, what have you seen so far in July, just in terms of demand for the 3 key components of the business refi\u2019s credit card insurance? Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "Let me hit some of that and then J.D. definitely chime in, and we should also \u2013 we\u2019ll also talk a little bit about student here in Q3, too. The card issuers are definitely back. Spend is definitely lower. And our focus is, as you said, on winning. And so we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got more budget than our competitors. That we\u2019re doing marketing better than our competitors and that our business is better than competitors. And we believe that it is based on everything that we\u2019ve seen and based on our conversations with the credit card companies.",
            "Their spend will come back. What we\u2019re hearing is it\u2019s not as much macro as much as it is more micro, which is they need to understand what the performance of their current loan losses are \u2013 loan portfolios are before they\u2019re going to materially take on new loans. And I would say that, that is, if you think about it, the overall theme of where LendingTree is right now, which is we\u2019re a marketplace for \u2013 between consumers. We\u2019re looking for money and small businesses looking for money and lenders who are looking to lend it for all types of loans.",
            "Right now, unless it\u2019s a government-backed loan, which is why mortgage is still low the other \u2013 in the private lending market, those areas are challenged. And we\u2019re winning, and they\u2019re going to come back. I think the personal loan market is not going to be dead forever. The private student loan market is not going to be dead forever, which is a big Q3 business for us. And we\u2019re doing fine. So in this environment, what I told us, we said last quarter is make sure that our people are safe, make sure the business is safe and then lean in and look for opportunities. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. J.D., do you want to add?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Doug Lebda"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. So Youssef, I guess I would just say, in card, we\u2019re encouraged that issuers are back, okay? And your channel checks are reflecting that. What your channel checks don\u2019t reflect is when they have a reduced payout or tightened underwriting. But we\u2019re happy that they\u2019re back and that the major issuers are dipping their toe in the water now. So that\u2019s great. I don\u2019t know that the \u2013 them getting more committed spend will be a function of KPIs in our network as much as it will be confidence in consumer spend. Right? ",
            "Think about why they\u2019re issuing a card, what they care about when they issue a new card. Obviously, the creditworthiness of that consumer, but also they want spend. They want a return for it. So as we see consumer spend \u2013 consumer spending increase, which it has been, fortunately. And we saw the article in the journal yesterday talking about what consumers have seemingly done with the stimulus money that\u2019s out there. That actually does create a good backdrop for them. But when we think about how we\u2019re planning for the remainder of the year, we\u2019re not anticipating resurgence. We think it\u2019s going to take some time. ",
            "If we\u2019re pleasantly surprised that it\u2019s better, great. We\u2019re encouraged that they\u2019re on the network. Now what can we do to induce them to spend more? And we\u2019re thinking about that in a very long-term way. Right. So we\u2019re using this period of time to try to test new experiences with issuers and to try to take market share and win, as Doug said. ",
            "So do those things manifest themselves in Q3 and Q4? No, probably not. There are things that help us win next year. And they probably drag a bit in Q3 and Q4, and that anticipation is reflected in the way that we\u2019ve guided for the consumer business or what we have in our forecast for the consumer business for the rest of the year. So that\u2019s card. ",
            "So we\u2019re certainly encouraged that they\u2019re back, but they\u2019re back in a very small way. I\u2019d rather more of them be back in a small way than have it be isolated to one or two insurers. The good news is it\u2019s somewhat broad in terms of them coming back.",
            "You asked another question, which is as we start the third quarter here, how does the trend line feel in each of refinance and card and insurance. And I would say that in insurance, we\u2019ve had very good acceleration, which we\u2019re thrilled with. That, in July, we\u2019re certainly double-digit to mid-teens growth in insurance, which we\u2019re very happy with. And so we\u2019re really thrilled with the performance there.",
            "Now the standout in the second quarter was refinance. We did enjoy extraordinary margins in the beginning of the quarter. Those had normalized in June, and we\u2019ve seen steady improvement in July. But I don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not anticipating. When you look at our guide, we\u2019re not anticipating that, that margin environment resumes in refinance at all. We\u2019re being somewhat conservative with that aspect. And we just want to take market share, as Doug said.",
            "Card, we\u2019ve touched on. The other areas of consumer worth noting, effectively, we projected when we went in May, and we said 60% to 80% in consumer, it ended up being 71%. We\u2019ve largely prepared for the remainder of the year for that consumer business to be slow to come back. The only other one worth noting is student. And so when you look at our guide, you have to recognize that student was a huge win a year ago in the third quarter. That was a business where revenue grew 64% year-on-year. ",
            "And given everything that\u2019s going on with fall semester enrollment deferment and reduce tuition spend, that market is going to be down 30%, and we have prepared for our business to be down more than that because we just don\u2019t have as many lenders looking for new student borrowers. So that\u2019s worth noting as well as we think about the third quarter. "

And you mentioned a number of like new products and new innovations and new initiatives that you were doing that really resonated with the lenders. Can you talk about that? And can you talk about how that has improved your market share in terms of the total loans that passed through your system, versus the total refi volumes that happened in the market in general? Thanks."

      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I\u2019ll take the second one first. So market share declines in this type of environment. However, in this type of environment in mortgage. However, in this type of environment, the market is growing substantially and all your \u2013 and what you\u2019re trying to do is make sure that you\u2019re growing wallet share that while your lenders are staying with you and continuing to bid with you and hopefully, shutting off or decreasing on your competitors. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.",
            "And the new experiences, the reasons we\u2019ve been able to do that have been, as we\u2019ve improved our, call it, CRM capabilities, and we are having more interactions with the consumer on our own. We are then able to, call it, curate particularly with My LendingTree and be able to deliver a \"exclusive\" lead to a lender.",
            "They\u2019re still getting choice. They\u2019re still \u2013 and they\u2019re \u2013 but it\u2019s \u2013 after they are able to make a more of a selection, and we\u2019re able to then send one lead to one lender while still giving choice with other lenders. And because of that, lenders are able to have higher conversion rates through their clogged systems.",
            "So in mortgage, as many shareholders have heard me talk about before, you\u2019ve got a somewhat people that \u2013 while you\u2019ve got in mortgage, all the capital you want right now because it\u2019s government backed in the conforming space, you get clogged in a refi environment around your existing customers coming back to you and other people coming in for free if you\u2019re a lender.",
            "And the great news of this year is we were able to have more of that volume stick with us, which has enabled us to have an outsized Q2. And the flip side of that, while we were having great lender performance, as J.D. alluded to, our marketing costs went down dramatically because those lenders and our competitors pulled out of the online ad marketplaces. And so our cost of acquisition went down. And so as J.D. said, we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we\u2019re assuming that, that normalizes going forward.",
            "However, the great news is that wallet share typically coming out of a situation like this completely sticks. And so as we\u2019re talking to personal loan lenders, we want to make sure those guys are with us more than with our competitors, same thing in mortgage, same thing in card, same thing in student, same thing in insurance. And if we keep growing the wallet share and keep getting that percentage of the spend and that helps on the marketing side, too. J.D., anything you want to add?"

      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "No. I don\u2019t have a lot to add. I mean I think, Kunal, we\u2019re really happy with the product innovation. It\u2019s everything from exclusive leads to a product that we\u2019re really happy with that is a midyear launch, which is a local loan officer product. It\u2019s all under this theme of CRM of greater identification at the top of the funnel as to where that consumer should go. And product efficacy like that is going to manifest itself in better wallet share.",
            "In a period like this, market share is never going to look great because there\u2019s just so much organic that all lenders get. So you\u2019ve got a denominator problem there when you look at market share. And we\u2019re focused on from an execution perspective is wallet share. We\u2019re really happy with that. And so that\u2019s the strategy in mortgage. And really, the strategy across all products. It just so happens that the product innovation in mortgage and insurance has been really extraordinary."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, hi guys. Hey, two questions. One quickly on the insurance product. You mentioned insurance being affected basically by market dynamics of people not buying cars and that\u2019s taking you down from growth to basically flat year-over-year. You have a competitor in the space that is predicting fairly high growth in this category this quarter. Obviously, they haven\u2019t reported. But is there anything else going on dynamic? And how are you doing versus competitors?",
            "And the second question is, you\u2019re calling for EBITDA guidance next quarter where the margins are roughly half what they were this quarter. Is there anything other than mix that is really driving that change?"
         ],

         "Remarks": [

         "Speaker": "Doug Lebda"
      },
      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, sure. In terms of insurance, I think recognized it in March when COVID first started, we certainly saw some impact from declining interest in new cars, in turn, new insurance, et cetera. And it has been a gradual climb back through the quarter. Through the second quarter, and we\u2019re thrilled with the recent performance in terms of insurance. Now as it relates to competitors, we approach the insurance business much the way we do all of our businesses, which is wallet share and gains with our carriers, right?",
            "And so when you look at year-over-year gains, you got to realize we\u2019re operating off of a pretty big base, and we\u2019re happy with the growth in \u2013 not only the growth in revenue, but the absolute profitability of our insurance business. We\u2019re particularly happy in insurance, with the product innovation that\u2019s going on there. So I don\u2019t spend too much time worrying about absolute growth rates. I worry about the health of the business. And in that respect, we\u2019re really happy with insurance. So I think we\u2019re going to get to the end of 2020 and say that we have not only a bigger business, but a healthier one and great prospects for 2021. So that\u2019s insurance.",
            "As it relates to the margin in Q3, you got to recognize we\u2019re not getting contribution from our consumer business. And one of the businesses in there, one of the big businesses in there is personal loans, which, as we\u2019ve always talked about, is one of our highest margin big businesses because it\u2019s so tied to My LendingTree. And so recognize when personal loans is diminished for all the obvious reasons that we\u2019re experiencing. That is going to factor into Q3. So that is mix, and that is most of it. I mentioned students, so that\u2019s just a tough comp issue. And then we\u2019ve assumed normalized margins in mortgage.",
            "Now there are a few things in there, Q2 to Q3 on the OpEx line that are worth noting. We did \u2013 some of that is hiring. We paused hiring in Q2 briefly, and we asked our teams to come back with a plan B. And the mandate on plan B was that hires that are made in the back part of this year have to be with the mind, obviously, to 2021 and the opportunity there. And so we\u2019re actually very happy that people came forward with aggressive plan Bs. And so we will have some lift in hiring in Q3, which is reflected in our guide.",
            "There is also, Nat, worth noting a fairly meaningful pickup in rent expense in Q3. We are moving \u2013 next year in Q1, we will move to our new headquarters. But from an accounting perspective, that rent expense needs to be recorded as soon as the building is technically available. And so that is embedded in here, and that is the facilities expense, just the new headquarters is $1.65 million of expense in Q3. Hiring is about $1.5 million. Do I think there will be some favorability there? Likely. And then there is some technology spend associated with the new headquarters as well. Tech expense ends up being \u2013 well, that\u2019s both new headquarters and some \u2013 what I would call scaling expense on the tech side, that\u2019s about $1.2 million.",
            "The one notable thing, we do have about $350 million of expense in there. We expanded benefits for employees around COVID and also added a work-from-home stipend, all things we were happy to do for our employees. So there are some things in there on the OpEx fund that are worth calling out, but most of it, Nat, is mix. And I think conservatism around what we think margins could be in mortgage. Where we \u2013 when we spoke to you in May and we gave our one quarter forward guide, we were conservative, and we\u2019re going to continue to take that approach for the time being."

And on the facilities thing, keep in mind right now, as J.D. said, from an accounting perspective, we\u2019re literally paying for a building that is theoretically available to us, but it\u2019s still being constructed. So it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re duplicating expenses. We\u2019ve still got facilities in Charlotte, where people will be able to go back to. And from an accounting perspective, we\u2019re adding on another expense from a building that\u2019s still being constructed. So that\u2019s the double count there. So that definitely goes away. And the only thing \u2013 other thing I\u2019d add is as these loan types come back, as these product categories come back, then things return to the old normal, hopefully, plus additional wallet and market share."

So does that mean like you believe you can get back to that revenue level in the next 18 months to 24 months? Or just how should we be thinking about the overall recovery?

We said really think about \u2013 don\u2019t think about the annual budget, think about the needs for the business over the next 18 months. And so we are staging that hiring. The hiring piece of it is lower. The \u2013 it is lower. It is not dramatically lower, and it is absolutely reflecting the fact that we do see that revenue opportunity coming back. We would be enabling plan B if we didn\u2019t. So you\u2019re just seeing a different timing of that hiring relative to us pausing a bit in Q2.

And even \u2013 and so when you have call center and marketing, obviously, which is the biggest variable, but even inside of technology, those projects are still done even though over a longer-term basis, on an IRR-focused way. So what you\u2019re seeing is if we\u2019re holding, for example, tech cost constant, that means that underlying those costs are projects that they\u2019re working on that are going to make us money, and we have confidence in them.",
            "So while we didn\u2019t \u2013 while we laid off the gas pedal because \u2013 and in order to do that \u2013 because underlying that, pulling off the gas pedal is that your unit economics are changing in the midst of COVID. And you\u2019re not sure where they\u2019re going to be. And then once you get confidence in those, you go in that again, okay, go back on. And in this \u2013 of our third financial crisis, we really did try to lean in once we knew that our employees were safe and the business was safe and that the business was going to be solid. And then as we said, we\u2019re just focused on winning.",
            "And so there are still great things that we\u2019re doing. And so the work in product and tech and in mortgage, for example, from last year came home this year. The work that we were doing last year in product and tech would have come home in some of these other small business. However, that market went away, the market comes back. That business is, I think, better than it was before.",
            "So I\u2019m thrilled with the resilience of the business and the fact that we\u2019re not losing money at a period like this. I mean if you go back in time and you look at how things have happened in other financial crises, they were very, very, very difficult for this company. And instead, we\u2019re making money and we\u2019re beating our competitors and doing very well. And able to access the capital markets, the M&A market is going to be very interesting, and we get to go now hunt for opportunities as opposed to being on the defensive."

The answer is yes, more interesting companies are coming our way, but not all for the same reason. It\u2019s not a scenario of everybody being distressed. In fact, in some respects, this period of time has actually demonstrated the attributes of some of our target companies or the companies that we just tracked over the years.",

And so we\u2019ve got to analyze is that a sustainable dynamic or not, right? We\u2019ve experienced in some of our businesses, so we have good experience with it. So it\u2019s changed a little bit. What I would say is the volume of things that are coming over to us is increasing.",

We think that category will be very interesting longer term. And so no, the categories are still the same, and I\u2019d say we\u2019re busier, and we\u2019re really encouraged."

So just if you could confirm that. And then the other question was the variable marketing margin was unusually high this quarter. Is there anything that you could pull from that, that could make it sustainable going forward or at least pull up that VMM from where it was historically? Or is this just a, I don\u2019t know, cyclical reality of where the business is, and it\u2019s natural to expect that to kind of float back down to those mid-30s levels? Thanks a lot."

Typically that will also improve your credit and the easiest thing is credit card consolidation or other debt consolidation into a personal loan. And with personal loan lenders pulling back, there are fewer savings opportunities. So you just \u2013 I can\u2019t say it as many people money. And that\u2019s okay because we only want to send the right message to the right person at the right time with no odds.",
            "On the VMM piece, it was obviously unusually high on a percentage basis this quarter. Because of the very low payout, the very low cost of acquisition in mortgage that I talked about before, things that we would learn from this period going forward would be just the continued emphasis and effort on recurring revenue and the \u2013 get you in for your first transaction, awesome. And then keep you here for the rest of your life, exceptional. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re just continuing to focus on that. And as J.D. said on the M&A side, that\u2019s where, as you look at things even on the asset side, it just \u2013 it brings in more customers, more ways you can save the money, more interactions, more ways of engagement and that, hopefully, over time, not hopefully, it will means less dependence on paid marketing.",
            "Now the other thing I would add, though, is can you know this from other Internet companies is if you\u2019re \u2013 these VMM dollars matter way more to us than VMM percentage because we\u2019ll mark it up to the last profitable dollar. And that changes intraday, intra week and the more products you have, the more you can also move that across products as well, too, if you\u2019ve got your marketing analytics, right, which we\u2019ve got pretty well nailed.

It\u2019s mostly just \u2013 it\u2019s personal loans. And as that business opportunity, the revenue opportunity goes away, that contribution from My LendingTree is going to go away. And furthermore, and we\u2019ve called this out in May, acquisition of My LendingTree consumers is going to be somewhat diminished because of PL interest diminishing. And so as that comes back, you\u2019ll see My LendingTree\u2019s contribution come back.",
            "The second question, the thing that makes it hard to answer is we\u2019re always going to go after the opportunity. And so there are going to be periods of time when we are going to be able to enjoy great margins with no degradation to the revenue opportunity. We just experienced that in mortgage for a period of time and had great margins. But ultimately, what we\u2019re trying to do is take wallet share and go after the dollars. And so there\u2019s a range there on margin. Part of Nat\u2019s question before was what is the new normal we\u2019re most focused on is that we are able to navigate whatever environment comes our way because when we have one product that\u2019s struggling for obvious reasons, something else is picking up the slack and executing to make up the difference. That\u2019s what we\u2019re thrilled with, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to manage the business."

I don\u2019t know if you guys can talk about your approach to kind of capturing more users and as best as you can tell, how much of that growth is kind of simply organically driven versus maybe more direct marketing spend? And then any plans to kind of pull harder on that lever, I guess, as the backdrop firms up a bit?"

            "So I\u2019ll start, and then J.D. can add on. Right now, it is mostly organically driven through interest from our other loan products coming in for filling out QFs. And we had plans, and they are still there that as the unit economics come back, we absolutely want to lean into marketing of that. The good news of COVID is it\u2019s given us more time to get the product even better. We\u2019ve got some really exciting product launches now in the back half of the year on that. And everything underlying it really comes down to the unit economics.",
            "So as you\u2019ve got more alerts that you\u2019re able to send out, your revenue per customer is going to go down and your \u2013 therefore, you can\u2019t go do the marketing, go do the advertising. So that is doing extremely well off of organic growth, and we\u2019ve gotten better and better at getting opt-ins there. So that\u2019s where that is. And it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m actually really, really pleased because the product is very good. People love it. The users are growing and the economics will come back. And for everybody and even on mortgage, a little bit on Mark\u2019s question, the unit economics underpin everything that you do. So in mortgage, for example, and underlying unit economics for lenders is really their conversion rate from a \"lead\" or a call or a click into a funded loan. So as we help lenders improve their conversion rates by those better user experiences by understanding more about our customer then they improve their bids.",
            "So in mortgage, for example, we were able to retain better than we otherwise would have bids because of the movement of our product of where we were. And so then our unit economics in mortgage were better on the revenue side. And on the cost side, were also better on downside. And then you just \u2013 we\u2019re basically marketing against capacity and how much lenders can handle. And because of exclusive, they could handle more. So that helped. But it obviously, you\u2019re still bumping up against their other organic capacity. And the same thing is true in My LendingTree. So users continue to grow, satisfaction continues to grow. The product gets better as the lenders come back, but that thing is going to sing even louder than already it is."

I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll be totally evident via channel checks, but you\u2019ll see some things roll out probably starting in September and through the end of the year. And there will be a few different categories. One will just be pure marketing partnerships, meaning how do we migrate somebody from a LendingTree experience to a Stash experience from a marketing perspective. And we\u2019re trying to do that with being true to kind of the consumer experience, right, and make sure that we\u2019re not screwing up that experience for either consumer, right? The \u2013 I think you\u2019ll start to see some of that. Now one of the interesting things that happened is in this environment, for Stash, I mentioned earlier that a number of companies have seen their cost to acquire customers go down. That has made it a little bit more of a moving target to make it work for them and for us. And so we\u2019re working through that, but I think you\u2019ll see something in September there. Now the thing that we\u2019re really excited about, however, is the opportunity for us to bring some of LendingTree\u2019s capabilities to them.",
            "Keep in mind when we talked about them, very product- centric company with a great user experience. What they\u2019ve not had are any credit products. So what you\u2019re most likely to see first is them \u2013 their consumers have access to personal loans. And that\u2019s something that when they\u2019ve done consumer surveys, that\u2019s something that\u2019s of interest there as well as their consumers have access to essentially the My LendingTree platform. And we\u2019re calling powered by LendingTree, which is essentially credit score plus our intelligence stack. So everything we\u2019ve built in My LendingTree rolling through to their customers.",
            "And those are probably the first two real applications of product between the two companies. Over time, what we\u2019d like to get to is to say, okay, let\u2019s take that Stash product and make it available to the My LendingTree consumer. But we\u2019re going slowly, so we do it right, and we\u2019re really excited about everything that we can do with them."

But Doug, I just wanted to revisit maybe the philosophy around investment. Of course, historically, there\u2019s been, let\u2019s call it, excess revenues, a lot of that has gone into driving future growth. And so I\u2019m just curious to understand how you\u2019re thinking about the medium-term growth opportunity at this particular point, given that there\u2019s so \u2013 it\u2019s such an unusual market condition and there may be, in fact, some permanent destruction to lending capacity in certain verticals."

And so you got to pause and then you got to go back and make sure your ROIs are right, and this is speaking from your CEO, who\u2019s also an accountant. So these things really matter to me. And so once \u2013 however, if they\u2019re still positive, you\u2019ve got to go do them. And I believe the opportunity around CRM is so fantastically great. And when I say CRM, I mean it in the true sense of customer relationship management, not only what I just alluded to in terms of getting repeat usage but in addition, and you followed us forever, the conversion rates, and you can just take one example.",
            "If we can take the mortgage refinance conversion rate from 2% to 3%, 4%, wherever it is today. Okay, because I don\u2019t want to give exact numbers to the 10, 15s when it was in 2005, 2006, 2007 now very, very different market than where everybody could obviously get a loan. However, technology has advanced. And we still see, for example, over half of the customers who are coming to LendingTree are even tire kickers, they\u2019re actually going and getting loans, sometimes from people on our own network. And obviously doing the same old thing they\u2019ve always done, which is using LendingTree to shop and use it with somebody else, totally fine. And by the way, in a declining rate environment, that gets even more exacerbated because you go get a 3% rate on LendingTree today. And then when you show up at your other bank, it\u2019s 2.5% tomorrow or they move it from a 30-year fix to a 5/1 ARM.",
            "So, as we are more interactive inside of the log and experience in LendingTree, those conversion rates move up, the bids move up and the opportunity just inside of our network is astounding. And I could move over to personal loans, too, and we could talk about approval rates and our level of integration with our lenders. And the fact that a whole bunch of those people go underserved that could go served if \u2013 as we have better integrations with our lenders, and we\u2019ve got some really exciting things going on there. Then you move over to credit card and you start to talk about the same type of things and being able to get preapproved offers. And when you look at \u2013 the easy way to say it is leakage.",
            "If you just converted the people, who are on our site or touching us today in a slightly more effective way, you grow the business dramatically without even factoring in that your marketing is now more efficient. And that\u2019s why the product investment continues because it\u2019s still positive.",
            "And pulling back on it would be the wrong way to go, at least from my perspective as a shareholder and from our other shareholders who sit on the Board, and we\u2019re \u2013 and the fact that we\u2019re doing it, I think, shows our confidence in it because when the stock tanked when everybody was worried, the easiest thing to do would be to go throw out a bunch of stuff. But the good news is that we had tracks laid down last year between finance and strategy. We\u2019re able to affect things. We\u2019re able to know \u2013 we\u2019re able to know our tech capacity better. And the project still make a heck of a lot of sense. And so until they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to do it. Now inside of that, I will also say that when the tide goes out, internally, you also see process that need fixed, areas that you were too bureaucratic, areas where you\u2019re not moving fast enough, and all of that gets sticks to.",
            "So that\u2019s a great opportunity for our employees. I told them that now is the opportunity to fix everything that was bugging you at LendingTree. And it\u2019s an opportunity to fix contract process and all the internal things that actually make the business run smoother, and that\u2019s all happening, too. And part of that is because the specter of LendingTree, of you losing your job, not having something interesting to work on, et cetera, is not hanging over your head. We\u2019re going to see that you\u2019re health is safe, your job is safe. And now you\u2019re still doing interesting work. You\u2019re just doing it from a \u2013 and that\u2019s our posture."

Doug\u2019s point is an important one, which is all the innovation around it enables them to have greater processing efficiency, et cetera. So that benefits us, right, in general. What we\u2019re seeing is actually some of those lenders who had been further down the stack for us in terms of activity getting more active.",

They\u2019re using that technology to scale and thus becoming a \u2013 and then they\u2019re able to be a bigger player on our network as a result of that added capacity.

            "Yes. And that\u2019s actually a really interesting point because that is really talking about the long tail effect. And as smaller lenders can compete with the big guys, you get less revenue concentration, which is we always generally have revenue concentration inside of individual loan products as the winners win. However, the winners typically change, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. But seeing lenders who historically have not been able to compete with the bigger guys who can now compete inside of the marketplace. And we help them and they help themselves, and we really work with them.",
            "That is a really, really good signal for me because that has been historically a challenge that you\u2019ve had really a bifurcated marketplace and mortgage, where you\u2019ve got the haves and have-nots and the have-nots have been living off of what the haves either don\u2019t want to do or can\u2019t do for the last few years. And now it\u2019s getting much more equal, and it\u2019s really interesting to launch."

            "Yes, absolutely. So listen, we\u2019ve had the good fortune of \u2013 we \u2013 if you think about the last two years, we issued a convert in May of 17 that just have our balance sheet, that cash enabled us to \u2013 that cash, coupled with our revolver, enabled us to do the acquisitions that we did in late 2017 and through 2018. And then ultimately, when we acquired QuoteWizard and ValuePenguin, we utilized our revolver. And our revolver served us very well. And we knew that we had a cash-generative business. We had paid that revolver down quickly, and it was very efficient. But we did operate through 2019. And until recently, with less cash on hand than I would necessarily like. It wasn\u2019t a problem because we had revolver capacity. We paid off \u2013 prior to our investment in Stash, we had paid off $165 million on our revolver. And \u2013 but we were operating with at any given time, 75 to 100 of cash. And for a company of our scale that\u2019s as acquisitive as we are, that\u2019s not really where I want to be.",
            "And so the recent financing enabled us to do a number of things. It enabled us to deal with near-term maturities, right? We bought in 130 of the existing convert with the proceeds from the new. We obviously have a bullish view on our stock because the equity outcome for us on that convert will not occur until north of $700 a share. And so we\u2019re able to tap the convert market again. We were able to pay off our revolver. And in terms of leverage, we\u2019re pretty comfortable with \u2013 we will be comfortable with taking on leverage. I think we \u2013 in this scenario, we find ourselves now with the ability to maneuver from an M&A perspective.",
            "We have cash on hand, we can look at acquisitions of great scale, we\u2019ll continue, by the way, I think, very effectively to continue to do the small acquisitions, Eric, that you\u2019ve seen us do and make grow faster. Those are still things that can really contribute for us. But the financing enables us to really have a lot of flexibility to look at bigger things. You look back at QuoteWizard. At that point, it was our largest acquisition at $370 million. And it\u2019s had a huge contribution, 27% of last year\u2019s revenue and performing great this year.",
            "So we want to be able \u2013 in a position to affect things like that and not have it be contingent upon financing. And that\u2019s what the recent refinancing that we did will enable us to be acquisitive to take on leverage and be aggressive, which is what we should be doing right now."

            "No, I am sorry. Very short answer. The short answer is yes. The mortgage market has been over watching this now for 25 or so years. The mortgage market because it has been from a lender perspective, so cyclical. By the way, we\u2019ve removed the cyclicality by the way we do pricing, et cetera has been underinvested in from a technology perspective because refi lenders are chock-full and just trying to make as much money as they can. And when it flips, they\u2019re poor and losing money and trying to figure it out. And this is \u2013 and so it makes them very difficult for them to plan for the long-term. And so it\u2019s taken for better or worse, 25 years from when I thought it actually existed, and it\u2019s getting kind of almost there. But if you go back in time, you\u2019ll see like, oh, online loan applications from Mortgage.com in like 1999, I think.",
            "And seriously, it didn\u2019t grip. Microsoft was doing something in 2000 and \u2013 with Freddie Mac that we were part of, and that didn\u2019t grip. So it\u2019s happening now. And as you\u2019ve seen in areas like personal loans with companies like Prosper and LendingClub, et cetera, that market, we were able to sort of light and have it take off very quickly because it was less sensitive to credit cycles and that we thought, and you had people there who are online from the beginning as opposed to offline moving online. And you don\u2019t necessarily need humans to talk you through how to get a personal loan, like you do with a mortgage. So the answer is the long. Back to the short answer, absolutely."

There are lenders, whether they\u2019re bank lenders or mortgage brokers for that matter, for whom the LendingTree solution has not historically worked. As we innovate the product and give it a different feel for different types of use cases, our odds of expanding our base of lenders increases. And that will diminish the volatility just by definition. Now that takes a long time, but some of the things that have occurred this past year that are largely directed at our existing lender base should actually be very extensible to a broader base of lenders, brokers, banks, et cetera. That\u2019s what we\u2019re excited about."

            "And I\u2019ll give you one example there. And that\u2019s a broadening of the lender base. One example there is many lenders operate with decentralized loan officers as opposed to having them in call centers. And we\u2019ve developed a solution now. We had a rudimentary solution a few years ago, but now lenders who have that, we can manage that. The challenge of managing that is you\u2019re not managing capacity at the entity level. So you\u2019re not saying lender X wants 1,000 new customers today, you have to say, they want 1,000 new customers. And they need them distributed five to this person in Des Moines, six in New York City to that person, seven over here, six over there, and you got to manage that at a local level and managing that at the local level is \u2013 gets you into more of a home adviser-like management, which is \u2013 which requires more analytics, more liquid \u2013 it\u2019s more complicated. And we\u2019ve got that now. So that enables us to expand the lender base as well. But yes \u2013 and the lender technologies just continue to get better. So this is structurally different."

What I would say is what we\u2019ve seen in agent behavior during this COVID period is more interest in our services. So our agent business is doing very, very well. And perhaps agents working from home are being more aggressive, more commercial, but we\u2019ve just seen a big uptick in the agent business. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily characterize it as reluctance of the carrier. And so we broadened our base of agents, and that\u2019s one of our best-performing businesses.",

If you look at the success story there in the last year, it has been getting a carrier with whom you have a great relationship and they\u2019re buying clicks. To then say, okay, clicks and leads or clicks and calls. So it\u2019s really a product attach rate story. And so they continue to innovate with products that will expand the opportunity to just keep doing that.
