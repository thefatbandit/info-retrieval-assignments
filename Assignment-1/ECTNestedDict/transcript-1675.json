         "Thank you, Mike. Welcome to the BrainStorm\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. And thank you everyone for joining us. The onset of this call, I\u2019m so proud to share with you that our cash on hand is by far our record for BrainStorm.",
         "We have never been in such a strong financial position. We have no debt, no convertibles or the like, we today are close to $35 million cash on hand. I will begin this morning\u2019s call with some introductory remarks and general corporate updates at BrainStorm.",
         "Next, our President and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ralph Kern will update you on our clinical programs including our pivotal ALS trial recently and recently announced Phase II Alzheimer\u2019s disease program and our Phase II Progressive MS trial.",
         "Following Ralph\u2019s comments Dr. Revital Aricha, our VP R&D will walk you through our development program for neuron derived [indiscernible] treatment for COVID-19. Our Chief Financial Officer, Preetam Shah will then provide updates on our financial results before turning it back to me for concluding remarks. We will, of course address your questions in the Q&A session. ",
         "We are proud of the continued dedication and focus from our team members. During these challenging times of the corona virus pandemic, our mission of Brainstorm is to leverage our proprietary technology neuron technology into the clinical development of new treatments for neurodegenerative disease patients with high unmet medical needs.",
         "This is an extremely important and worthy mission during normal times. And it requires an even greater level of commitment, creativity and collaboration within. We are grateful to our community partners, which includes patients, the families, doctors, regulatory bodies, and so many more for helping us to continue to move forward over the past few months.",
         "This morning, I would like also to recognize two new additional to our senior management team in the second quarter. Dr. David Setboun joined us in April, 2020, and serves as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Dr. Setboun has extensive experience in the biopharmaceutical industry, including key leadership roles in commercial development and product launches at Biogen.",
         "Most recently he served as VP Corporate Development Strategy and Business at Life-bio Sciences, where here was instrumental in the development of various critical commercial operating and funding milestones. We are thrilled that David has joined our team and expecting to play a key role in the potential commercial launch of neuron in the next couple of years.",
         "Dr. Stacey Lindbergh joined us in June, 2020 and the role of Executive Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Research. Dr. Lindbergh is an experienced healthcare executive and globally recognized medical statistician with over two decades of multinational experience in R&D, regulatory, strategies development, analytics and big data, [indiscernible] and Biogen.",

      "Operator": [
         "Greetings everyone and welcome to the BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics\u2019 Financial Results for the Second Quarter of 2020 and Corporate Update Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.",
         "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael Wood of LifeSci Advisors. Sir, you may begin."
      ],
      "Preetam Shah ": [
         "Thank you, Revital. It is my pleasure now to walk you through our second quarter 2020 financial results. Research and development expenses in net for the three months ended June 30, 2020, where 5.69 million compared to 3.55 million net for the three months ended June 30, 2019.",
         "This increase year-over-year was primarily due to increase in expenses due to materials and other costs, payroll and stock based compensation and the decrease in participation of IIA and CIRM under various ordered grants and proceeds received under the hospital extension program.",
         "Excluding participation from IIA and CIRM under the grants and proceeds received from the hospital exemption regulatory pathway research and development expenses decreased by 520,000 from 6.54 million in the second quarter of 2019 to 6.02 million in the second quarter of 2020.",
         "General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2020 were 1.71 million compared to 1.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019. This increase year over year was primarily due to increase in payroll stock based compensation, rent, and other costs partially offset by decreasing PR costs, consultants and travel expenses.",
         "Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2020, was 7.4 million or $0.25 per share as compared to a net loss of 4.9 million or $0.23 per share for the three months ended June 30, 2019. Cash, cash equivalents, including short-term bank deposits were approximately 16.2 million as of June 30, 2020, compared to approximately 2.7 million as of June 30, 2019. In the month of July, 2020, we further strengthened our balance sheet.",
         "We raised approximately 13.6 million from our ATM facility at an average price of $14.48 per share, and additional 6.3 million to excise a warrant from circled warrant holders, and also received a non-dilutive bonus payment of 700,000 from CIRM for treating more California patients than originally proposed in our Phase III ALS trial.",
         "With these activities, our total available funding as of July 31 2020, which includes cash on hand of approximately 34.7 million as well as remaining non-dilutive funding from CIRM, IIA and other grants amongst approximately 37.5 million. For further details on our financials please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC today.",
         "Back to you Chaim."
      ],
      "Ralph Kern": [
         "Thank you Chaim and thank you everyone for joining us today on the earnings call. Let me start with an update on our Phase III pivotal trial of neuron in ALS. As a reminder, the trial is being conducted at six ALS of excellence in the U.S., it has enrolled approximately 200 participants, randomized one-to-one to receive three doses of neuron or placebo. These were administered over four months and then participants in the trial are followed for a total of 28 weeks.",
         "As we announced on July 2nd, we\u2019re very pleased to restate that all participants in the pivotal ALS Phase III trial have received all scheduled doses of neuron. We were able to achieve this important milestone as a result of the relentless dedication of trial participants, their loved ones, our investigators and the outstanding team here at Brainstorm.",
         "On behalf of all of us and Brainstorm, I again want to thank everyone for their commitment during a very unique and challenging time. As previously announced, following completion of all study visits, data collection and database lock. We expect Phase III top line data by the end of November of this year.",
         "At BrainStorm, we are staffing up a highly experienced team. And we are very busy on a day-to-day basis planning and executing to support data readouts on all pre-BLA activities. Our clear focus is to expedite this process. We want to be able to submit a Biologic License Application or BLA with the FDA as soon as possible after the top line data is available.",
         "At the same time, as our clinical trial activities and data preparedness is growing and advancing, we are proceeding with all CMC activities that are needed for the preparation of a BLA. Finally with respect to BLA, planning, and understanding the urgency of the ALS community and also in full dialogue with the FDA. We are actively exploring opportunities to expedite information flow and the review process itself.",
         "In June, we announced that the ALS Association, and IMALS awarded and BrainStorm a combined grant of $500,000 to fund an ALS biomarker study. The grant will be used to draw insights from data and samples collected from patients enrolled in Brainstorms ongoing Phase III clinical trial of NurOwn treatments. And to further understand critical biomarkers associated with treatment response for people with ALS.",
         "The study involves one of the largest and most robust clinical trial collections of CSF and serum biomarkers to-date. And we are very excited that this will advance ALS, understanding and also contribute to our understanding of how NurOwn can be a great value to the ALS population.",
         "In late June, we announced a new clinical program focused on the development of NurOwn as a treatment for prodromal to mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We hosted a key opinion leader call and webcast on July 8th, that we would encourage you to listen to if you have a chance.",
         "The call included professors Philip Shelton\u2019s and Bruno Dubois, who provided a great overview of why we made the decision to study NurOwn and Alzheimer\u2019s disease and why we are hopeful in the potential of NurOwn\u2019s who address the great unmet need in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
         "The study will be conducted at two leading centers of excellence in the Netherlands and France. We plan to treat the first Alzheimer\u2019s clinical trial participant with NurOwn before the end of this year.",
         "I\u2019m also happy to report that our progressive MS trial is now fully enrolled. Despite facing severe COVID-19 hospital restrictions in the spring, we still expect all study treatments to be completed by the end of this year.",
         "Due to the rapid enrollment in the last month, the time difference between a potential interim analysis later this year, and full data analysis is much shorter than anticipated. Therefore, it is most practical and informative for us to present an analysis of the full data set. And that is our current plan.",
         "In addition to the steady progress made across all of the clinical programs in BrainStorm that I have just described, we are supporting a small, compassionate, MSC program for COVID, ARDS in Israel, as we previously announced.",
         "We have examined strategic opportunities around COVID ARDS and we have identified the advantages of using exosomes as a treatment platform. And by leveraging our strong capabilities and exosomes manufacturing and IP, we have conducted a proof of biology study of NurOwn derived exosomes in a mouse model of ARDS which my colleague Dr. Revital Aricha, will now share. Revital."
      ],
      "Revital Geffen-Aricha": [
         "Thank you Ralph. And let me join my colleagues in thanking you all for joining us today. We recently announced the BrainStorm successfully completed its first milestone in developing an innovative exosomes the base platform technology for the treatment of severe COVID-19.",
         "As you are aware COVID-19 reduced no money has been associated with Huge Respiratory Distress Syndrome or HRDS. Currently there is no effective treatment to prevent or reverse HRDS. HRDS is a type of respiratory failure associated with widespread inflammation and lung damage caused by a cytokine storm in the most severely affected patients.",
         "Presenting on samples derived exosomes again suggested as a potential treatment for HRDS due to the ability to penetrate into deep tissue effectively deliver bioactive molecules to target cells and decrease the inflammatory response.",
         "MSC [indiscernible] maybe delivered intravenously or directly to the into the lungs. We are in total administration in a several practical advantages including ease of storage, stability and low immunogenicity.",
         "BrainStorm decided to evaluate MSC and NurOwn derived exosomes in HRDS mouse model or relevant is to the severe acute lung injury. In this trial, the animals were treated with either NurOwn derived exosomes or exosomes derived from the [indiscernible] from the same donor and compared the placebo treatment and host mice.",
         "Treatment was given either intravenously or directly to the lungs. Analysis was conducted on lung tissue pathology, daily assessment of oxygen separation and heart rate and measurement of point cometary cytokines and chemokines in the bone called [indiscernible] and serum.",
         "The study demonstrated several key observations. We demonstrated that animals treated with NurOwn derived exosomes showed superior results compared to [indiscernible]. The results showed statistically significant improvement of NurOwn derived exosomes in multiple parameters including functional language, recovery reflected by increased oxygen situation to normal levels, reduction in confirmatory cytokines, and most importantly, continuation of lung damage.",
         "Secondly, we observed that direct administration of NurOwn derived exosomes directly into the lungs through the [indiscernible] show the advantages over the intravenous administration. We plan to submit these important results to approve reviewed medical journal and we are actively evaluating illness test to determine how best to proceed.",
         "Thank you, and I turn to Preetam Shah, our CFO for Q2 financial update."

I just like to ask a couple of quick questions, in terms of ALS we are at a point now where we really have to think very carefully about the probabilities of success, how much data you have seen from the current trial and how well that data that you currently have and have released lines up with the Phase II data that you have seen previously.",
            "That is my first question is when I connect the dots between what you have now and the pivotal trial versus what you had in the Phase II trials, did they line up precisely? Is it even better now that you are looking at multiple doses, any insights that will help us gauge probability of success and outcome would be greatly appreciated? "

         "Remarks": [
            "So thanks for the question. Obviously we are blinded to the current Phase III trials, so we don\u2019t have visibility to the results. What I can tell you is that we have designed the Phase III trial to optimize our probability of success.",
            "Few things that we have done here, clearly the use of repeated dosing compared to a single dose in the Phase II randomized trial, we have enriched the trial population to select a group of ALS participants who have a more predictable rate of decline in the run in period.",
            "I think that that goes a long way to increasing the odds of success. I think in addition the lessons we have learned from Phase II, we have applied to Phase III in terms of which biomarkers to look at and how to proceed along those lines. ",
            "One big difference between Phase II and Phase III is that we have seven serial CSF samples, which will as we mentioned earlier, is a unique collection of biomarkers and we believe that the confirmation of a clinical results through changes even related changes in a biomarker will be very important in both the regulatory review and subsequently interactions with payers.",
            "Because we are trying to take a neurology and use the oncology model where we have not just clinical outcomes, but we have verification of biological effects. So I think those are all the reasons why we believe that our Phase III trial has all the right ingredients for success. And obviously we are very anxious to get the top line data.",
            "As we mentioned earlier, we have done a lot of work this year, internally and with our sites, so that we will be ready on time. And we are looking forward to have the top line data at the end of November. "

            "In other words, the right stuff, if we change gears. And I think about all timers. When I think about ALS, I think about an inflammatory condition. When I think about all timers, I see a condition with multiple comorbidities and while inflammatory can be a component in the CNS and particularly in the brain, can you help me understand mechanistically how you are making that jump in terms of the mechanism of action that is impacting ALS patients versus what you hope will impact Alzheimer\u2019s patients."

            "Yes, I will be brief because I don\u2019t want to extend this too long. But I will just give you the top line view of why we think the mechanisms of NurOwn are applicable as a technology platform and across different diseases. As we demonstrated in ALS, we are able to both deliver cargo which are repair molecules, which help stabilize and restore a atrophic support.",
            "We saw very interesting results in it inflammatory changes, a 40% reduction of some key inflammatory markers. It turns out that to our surprise, and actually to our pleasure that in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the same markers actually have even stronger correlations with rate of cognitive decline.",
            "And it seems that in most neurodegenerative diseases, particularly the ones that we are studying right now, there is an inflection point in the disease where the nerve degeneration picks up pace. And along with that, the inflammatory component also keeps moves in parallel.",
            "And then we have seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that the interaction between inflammatory markers such as MCP1, amyloid and tau work together, so that in the presence of those biomarkers that the disease is, is very different than we believe this is a huge opportunity to test the potential of NurOwn, and we would expect that the impact on inflammation would not be disease specific, but would be a platform attribute of NurOwn."

            "Thank you very much. One last question on exosomes, which is, I can understand exactly why I would use kind of a NFC to trophically home to the lungs to break the cytokine cascade and reduce inflammation. How do I make the jump from that homing capability along the gradients whether it is SPF 1 HIP, HIF, versus an acne zone, which is really kind of like the raw materials that I need to impact a localized environment. Where do I get the homing capability in terms of the delivery and of course, this relates to your COVID project. Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, sure. Thanks. Again, you are giving me all the hard questions. Yes, no, I think I think there is a couple of ways to look at it. One is that, we have confirmed, we have shared this in scientific meetings that a lot of the attributes of NurOwn are actually mediated through exosomes.",
            "Exosomes deliver cargo, they produce immunomodulation. They also deliver micro RNA. So, we know that that is an important component of it. The reason we are looking at exosomes, and I think Revital touched upon that earlier is that there are practical advantages of exosomes in terms of storage stability formulation.",
            "We know that in our hands and in other people\u2019s hands that exosomes are very avidly taken up into tissues. We know that local administration of exosomes is a very unique opportunity and in this case, we had demonstrated that delivery into the endotracheal tube for keel administration produce superior results compared to IB. And we know that getting to the target is really important.",
            "And then the last point you raised about homing that exosomes home as well to inflammatory signals. We know that we have shown in our preclinical studies but neuron administered, and for example, Parkinson\u2019s disease homes directly to the site of injury.",
            "So we expect that the coming function might also apply to exosomes. And, there is growing evidence in other people\u2019s hands and in ours that this is a very important approach. There is still some unanswered questions and that is obviously why we are doing preclinical studies before we make a final decision."
