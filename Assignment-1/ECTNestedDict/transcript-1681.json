      "Drew Alexander": [
         "Thank you, Michelle, and thanks to all of you for joining us. I want to stress our first priority is the safety and well-being of our associates, tenants, stakeholders and the broader community during these challenging times. Let me also remind you of the forward-looking disclosure Michelle just mentioned.",
         "Considering the severity of the pandemic, I think WRI performed well this quarter. While we're pleased, relatively speaking with our cash collections and rent deferrals to date, the significant increase in COVID-19 cases in the last several weeks is obviously a cause for concern. Johnny will get into our ongoing efforts with our tenants. But I can assure you, the Company is engaged in extensive tenant communications as we do what we can to assist them in this difficult time.",
         "Our collections were good for the quarter and July is continuing the upward trend. While we will have challenges as we move forward, the multi-year transformation of our portfolio has certainly made the road ahead easier. Our transformation resulted in a much higher percentage of grocery-anchored centers, a much improved tenant base and most importantly a much stronger balance sheet with little near-term debt maturities. And our 2020 dispositions have further strengthened our liquidity position, while further derisking the portfolio. While the timing of the recovery is uncertain, we are confident that we have more than adequate liquidity to weather the storm.",
         "Consistent with our message in the first quarter, we announced a dividend of $0.18 per share for the second quarter. Given our dispositions of $131 million to date, it's likely that we will also pay a special dividend near year-end. Later in the year, we will know more about 2020 dispositions and the performance of the portfolio. We will carefully monitor our cash flow and liquidity and further adjust the dividend as appropriate.",
         "All three of our new development projects are progressing nicely. There is minimal additional investment at Centro and West Alex and D.C. and leasing is continuing to progress. Construction is ongoing at The Driscoll and Houston with leasing recently under way. These are good projects and while there may be some short-term issues, longer term these are great properties.",
         "Steve?",
         "Thanks, Johnny. For years Weingarten Realty has been known as a great operator of real estate. While our current situation is challenging, I'm confident that we will once again rise to the occasion. A heartfelt thanks goes out to all our associates who are working so very hard right now and a genuine thanks to our Board of Trust Managers who have provided constant quality feedback throughout these difficult times. Great people, great properties and a great platform equals great results. I thank all of you for joining the call today and for your continued interest in Weingarten.",
         "Operator, we would now be happy to take questions."
      ],
      "Johnny Hendrix": [
         "Thanks, Steve. First I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all our associates who produced the best results possible given very difficult circumstances. We have a highly motivated team along with a strong, diversified, transformed portfolio. 80% of our annual base rent comes from shopping centers with the supermarket component. Pre-pandemic those supermarkets averaged very strong sales of $712 per square foot.",
         "Not only have our supermarkets been thriving during the pandemic, they are poised for the future. Over 75% of all our supermarkets have some sort of online component offering curbside pickup and/or delivery services and we worked with them to improve these logistics during the pandemic. We feel strongly that our team and our portfolio are positioned to withstand current headwinds and drive into the future.",
         "For the second quarter, we collected 77% of the rent billed. This includes triple net charges billed monthly and base minimum rent. We've accounted for over 90% of the rent owed during the second quarter with either rent collected or some other agreement like deferrals. 13% of the second quarter rent was deferred.",
         "In broad general terms one could think of two types of deferrals, strategic or lifeline. Strategic deferrals are generally with major tenants, mostly in our top 25, where we've been able to support their cash flow while negotiating beneficial amendments that will help Weingarten in the future. This could be suspending co-tenancy, loosening exclusives or restrictions or allowing future redevelopment. Lifeline deferrals are mostly with smaller tenants who just need help. About a third of our deferrals in this quarter are strategic deferrals. We feel strongly these will be repaid. It's challenging to estimate how much of the lifeline deferrals will ultimately be repaid.",
         "Today, about 95% of our tenants are open. As a result, July collections have shown improvement. To date, we've collected cash for 82% of the July rent bill. We obviously are concerned about the bankruptcies over the last several months. We do not have a lot of exposure to any single tenant, but the collective weight of the bankruptcies is impactful. 24 Hour Fitness terminated three leases. We have three remaining. We had six Stage Stores, four in ventures and two, 100% owned. Initially they have closed one store and plan to liquidate the company over the next several months.",
         "We have nine Tuesday Morning stores. None of those have been rejected today. We have three Sweet Tomatoes, all were rejected. We had 23 GNC stores, three have been terminated today. We also had 10 leases with the Ascena. Two leases are on the rejection list filed last week. Finally, we have one still at the top, which we think will be affirmed and one New York & Company store, which will be terminated. These bankruptcies represent $3.4 million in annual base minimum rent being terminated.",
         "Going forward, we are particularly concerned about large health clubs, theaters and high-end restaurants. Fortunately, our exposure to these tenants is pretty small. Combined these three categories are only about 3% of our ABR. The Company currently has contractual commitments for leases signed and not commenced for $9.1 million that we expect to commence over the next four quarters. Some of these commencements have already been delayed. But together with our tenants, we continue to move forward plans and construction spaces.",
         "During the quarter, we executed 27 new leases for $1.8 million in base minimum rent. While this is less than previous periods, we see some demand returning. Currently, we have 62 new leases being negotiated in our legal department. This is slightly higher than our 12-month trailing average, which is very encouraging.",
         "We're working with discount clothing stores, hardware stores, banks, dollar stores like Five Below and Dollar Tree, restaurants, mainly QSRs, and medical tenants. The Company is already ramping up leasing production capabilities, adding leasing, construction and legal personnel so we will be prepared when we get to the other side of this pandemic. Weingarten has always excelled at leasing and we will again as we release our very strong properties.",

         "Also during this conference call management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations or FFO, both core and NAREIT, which we believe help analysts and investors to better understand Weingarten's operating results. Reconciliation to these non-GAAP financial measures is available in our supplemental information package located under the Investor Relations tab of our website.",

         "Good morning and welcome to the Weingarten Realty Inc. Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. My name is Brandon and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.",
         "And I will now turn it over to Michelle Wiggs. Michelle, you may begin."
      ],
      "Steve Richter": [
         "Thanks, Drew. Core FFO for the quarter ended June 30th, 2020 was $0.34 per share compared to $0.53 per share for the same quarter of the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of the pandemic, which resulted in a charge to income in the quarter of $19.3 million or $0.15 per share related to the collectability of revenue, which includes $4.8 million or $0.04 per share for non-cash straight-line rent receivables. As a reminder, we also recorded reserves for uncollectible revenue in the first quarter of $9.4 million, which included non-cash straight-line rent receivable of $7.6 million. A reconciliation of net income to core FFO is included in our press release.",
         "Let me add a little color on our bad debt expense we realized for the quarter. From a business perspective, we look at operations on a pro-rata basis. At quarter-end on a pro rata basis, we recorded a reserve for bad debt of $14.7 million, which excludes reserves for straight-line rent and unbilled accruals. Our cash collections at quarter-end, again on a pro-rata basis, were 73%. So with the remaining 27% of uncollected rents, we reserved 46%, a little less than half of that rent, which includes deferrals. Subsequent to quarter-end, we collected an additional $4.4 million of cash, improving our pro rata cash collections for the second quarter to 77%. We have provided some additional details of our collections that can be found on Page 41 of the supplemental.",
         "With respect to our balance sheet, during the second quarter we paid all amounts outstanding under our credit facility. Based on our current projections, we will have more than adequate liquidity even after the payment of dividends to comfortably sustain operations. I want to remind everyone that we have no material maturities till October of 2022. Currently we have $498 million of current capacity under the revolver and about $24 million of excess cash.",

         "Remarks": [
            "Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Just in thinking about the collections and what you have under deferral agreement, that leaves about 10% unresolved. And if you reserved about 30% against the deferrals and it sounds like the majority of that is the lifeline tenants, the balance implies that you've reserved close to 75% of the unresolved bucket. Just as we move into August and September collections, are you expecting that those under deferral agreement will pay rent in those months? And how much of that unresolved bucket could ultimately fall out and turn into vacancy?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Hey, Christy. It's Drew. I'll start out here and I think Steve and perhaps even Johnny will attempt to opine. It's so challenging to say. We've got a good tenant profile. We -- a lot of the tenants are paying on their deferrals. 95% of our tenant base is open. Many tenants report good sales, all things considered, the exceptions Johnny cited in some of the upscale restaurants and then those tenants who are closed. So we're optimistic about it.",

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "The only thing I could add to that, Christy, is that as we go through the amount of deferrals that we're now executing is going down. So you have a little bit of mixture in there. And as Drew mentioned, it's just too tough to understand exactly how this thing will roll out, especially with, what I call, the second surge and so forth going forward. So I think that you can draw some. You can get some feeling from history, but I think going forward it's still a challenge."

         "Remarks": [
            "So I guess just to get a better sense for the moving parts and thinking about the upward trend of collections in sort of throughout Q2 but also into July, is there anything changing in the calculation that we should be aware of? So just trying to get a sense for how much of the rise in collections has been driven by tenants paying that weren't before versus any change in the denominator that's been impacted by occupancy loss or rent abatement."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I think it gets a little granular. But I think the thing that one has to think about is the deferrals you are reserving for rent earlier and Q2 then and some of those tenants have opened back up and that's where you see the collections going forward in July improving. So I think how much of that we collect going forward of those deferrals is a question and we reserved a good chunk of that. So I think it's a little bit of a moving target, but also realizing that as those tenants open back up they are able to pay rent going forward."

But this might help you also understand the vast majority I think, Johnny, of the tenants that we haven't resolved things with are the tenants in the categories that you talked about where there is just no visibility to things, theaters, health clubs, upscale restaurants."

Others are tenants where there is just no visibility as to how eventually this thing will turn out. And we are really just waiting to resolve that. There are some tenants, the smaller tenants that in their own mind having come to grips with how this thing ends, what it looks like on the other side and have just not been willing to agree to anything."

            "Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to dig into the cash based discounting a little bit. So I'm curious how many tenants or what percent of rent has been shifted to cash accounting since the beginning of the year. What's that level of contractual rent from cash basis tenants? And then what percent of rent from the cash basis tenants was paid in Q2 and in July so far?"

            "Good morning, Greg. This is Steve. At June 30th, at quarter-end, 15% of our Q2 billings were categorized as cash basis under the new accounting rules. We had collected as of quarter-end, about 31% of that and that's grown since quarter-end to about 43%. So that gives you some feeling kind of back to Christy's question as we go forward things have gotten a little better. And then the only other thing I would add to that is, of that group, we have reserved about 86% of the amount that were unpaid at quarter-end. That gives you a perspective of reserving of the cash-basis tenants at this point."

      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And then I guess maybe for Johnny real quick here. So rent spreads still seem decently healthy this quarter. So I'm just curious how much of that was due to leases already in discussion ahead of the pandemic. And then based on the new leases that are currently sitting with the legal department, kind of what are your expectations for rent spreads into the back half of the year?"

      },
      "18": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Good morning, Greg. I wouldn't read a whole lot through the rent spreads that we reported this quarter. A significant number of those were renewals that were actually completed prior to the pandemic and are commencing this quarter. Some of those are new leases that were agreed to prior. I think going forward, very difficult to understand what will happen to rent growth. I think it will be more negative than it was this quarter.",
            "For the leases that we have in process today, there is not a lot of growth, there is not -- it's not low either. So I don't see that we really have much visibility even with the new leases that we're working on right now. And a lot of it ultimately will depend which ones end up getting signed.",
            "Traditionally we've got somewhere around a 95% hit ratio. We complete about 95% of the leases that go into my legal department. I think today we're probably more in the 75% to 80% range. So, who knows, which ones of those leases actually get signed and completed."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Thank you. I'm just wondering in terms of the states that have shown a spike up, Texas, California, Arizona and Florida, is there a potential that your 95% tenants open may decrease given newer mandates in those states or are you thinking you're going to stay with that 95% open?"

We have seen fortunately here in Texas cases moderate and that's true in a lot of places. My personal feeling, reading a lot being a little involved in medical stuff, is I think that there won't be significant shutdowns.",
            "There are, obviously, issues around bars and gathering and sports and other things, because when you just look across the world there is a big economic impact to it. So it's certainly possible. We are 63% essential services, which we think is a good thing. Limited exposure to the things that are really at risk. Don't think it will happen, but it's certainly possible. And we encourage people to stay safe and pleased to see the numbers getting better.",

For the most part, our exposure there is fairly limited. And so long as that remains the case, I think 95% is probably a number. Does it go to 90%? Maybe. But I think we'll probably be in pretty good shape unless it becomes more severe."

For the transactions that closed in the second or third quarter -- second and third quarter, I'm curious are these deals that were negotiated pre-COVID and you got across the finish line or are these new properties that you put on the market since March?

            "So the things especially that we closed earlier this month were done post the crisis that what we did in the quarter was a little bit of a blend. We have been very selective about what we're selling, looking at non-supermarkets to sell and I think I can say to you also looking at lower TAP scores as part of it.",
            "Very pleased to exit Utah, which is something that we've been working on for a long time. And I like Utah as a place to ski and visit etc, but happy to be focused in other places and not doing business there. So, as mentioned, we are looking at continuing to hone the map to derisk where we can to focus on the better markets stronger tenants. So there are issues around financing. It seems to be mostly timing issues that everything takes longer. A lot of it's just the logistics around travel with inspections, surveys, etc. We do find people able to get financing generally. So things are functioning OK. Certainly much better than the GFC.",

We don't finance. But obviously some of the sellers -- excuse me, some of the buyers that we're selling to do. But I'm not aware of anything there.",
            "The Lifeco market is, as I think still open. They are very focused on grocery-anchored centers that you can get your arms around the NOI of the center with a lot of strong tenancy there that you can get deals done. I think most of the transactions that I've heard about or seen are really more bank relationship type financing that is just short term bridging type stuff. So I think money is out there. I think it would be fair to say retail is not the most favorite class today. Having said that, I don't think the market is totally shut down."

            "That's helpful color. Maybe one follow-up on that. Just curious on the sales in the third quarter. In your mind was there a big decline in value on these marks compared to what you could have sold these things at, let's say, six months ago?"

         "Remarks": [
            "No, Vince. In fact one of the things we're very pleased with, we review this with our Board, is we look at sales price relative to our internal estimates of NAV. And so far we've been very successful at selling properties that makes strategic sense to sell often in the bottom of the portfolio at equal to or, in many cases, better than our pre-COVID NAV.",
            "So do appreciate it causes some short-term pain, the dilution. But given the discount the stock is to current estimates of NAV and the significant discount to the stock would be at pre-COVID NAV to sell strategically improving properties at pre-COVID NAV or better is a very desirable thing for us long term. I can't warrant that that condition will continue or continue to look at each sale, but so far so good."

We haven't really tried selling too much of the really good stuff, but from what we hear those cap rates are likely down and what we see in the acquisition market would support that really good qualities down just because interest rates are so low.",
            "There does seem to be possibly some widening and significant widening if there is appreciable risk. A watch list tenant that is at the top of market or over market whose lease is up in the next 18 months, that's something that I would think there is a widening of the cap rate. That's something that we probably wouldn't sell because strategically for us it's about derisking. It's not about what I call locking in a worst-case scenario. So we would probably try to work through that and just not go into the teeth of that kind of problem because we don't -- we don't -- we are only interested in selling if we can improve things strategically and derisk.",
            "On the developments, it's hard to say. Yeah, there could be some slippage, but I don't think it will be significant. Things are taking longer. We have made a lot of progress in the two D.C. projects. In fact at West Alex we've increased our leasing by a few units since we reported up almost to 27%, it's continuing to make good progress at Centro, up over 91% leased there. Harris Teeter is in for permits at West Alex. It's on the schedule for them to open in November '21. There's been a lot of internal talk that they might open early, perhaps say 13 months from now, which would certainly help the project. So it might move in a little bit as everything has taken longer with the permits and everything. But generally speaking, good.",
            "At The Driscoll here in Houston, we have started leasing. We've leased 15 units, obviously between COVID and oil, there are some concerns. But so far the quality locations in and around The Driscoll have held up real well on the market rents. The project was always envisioned to more of an empty-nester who was selling their home and want a lock-and-leave lifestyle. So it's not as affected as some other things. Great locations and with the apartment rents we can reprice. So we're pleased with things. Might move a little bit, but very good long-term locations and we'll be enjoying them for a while.",

It really -- when you look at the cap rate at a project where the NOI is not easily determined, that's where I think we're going to see some real rise in cap rates over time."

I think most private folks have operated pretty much like us because it's pretty much the right thing to do from a lot of perspectives. As Johnny said if a tenant was in good standing before the crisis, it's probably in the landlord's best interest to keep them and work with them versus dealing with the downtime and the change.",

It all comes down to the quality of the real estate and the tenant make-up. And that's where I have friends who have great quality real estate and friends not so much good quality real estate. I think generally speaking, the public REITs have way better than average of the 30,000 shopping centers. So the Weingarten portfolio, I think, is good within the REITs. But all the REITs together are better than the average center. So I don't see too much differences and the differences I do see would be more around the quality of the real estate.

But at some point we'll have to see where we are with individual tenants, with their occupancy and those sorts of things.
