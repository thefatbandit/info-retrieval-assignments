         "\u2026 Global Healthcare Conference. And it\u2019s a pleasure to introduce the next presenting speaker. So, first of all, I\u2019m Charles Duncan. I\u2019m a Senior Biotechnology Analyst for Cantor. And I\u2019ve been covering this sector for many years and few times have I ever seen what I\u2019ve seen in the last six months and so it\u2019s very exciting. Should you live in exciting times. It\u2019s interesting to introduce the next presenting company, which is Novavax, ticker symbol is NVAX. I reiterate -- I cover this stock with an overweight rating and a $211 price target. And it\u2019s a pleasure to introduce senior management from Novavax, Mr. Stan Erck, the company\u2019s CEO; and Dr. Greg Glenn, the company\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer. Thank you, gentlemen, for joining us. Hello."

            "Doing very well. Interesting times you\u2019ve been living in. I can\u2019t believe you could take the half an hour out of your very busy schedules to talk to me today. But I very much appreciate it. So, Novavax is in, already had a very interesting year with some clinical data out of their NanoFlu program earlier this year and then we were all COVIDified. And so, I guess, I\u2019m wondering if you could just give us a perspective on your view of, why the company exists and should these be quite interesting times for you?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. That\u2019s great. So why does this company exist? So I think as everybody knows we\u2019re a vaccine company. We\u2019ve been developing a platform of vaccines that have -- has pushed us toward being a respiratory vaccine company. We have vaccines for RSV, respiratory syncytial virus that cause of hospitalization of newborns in the U.S.",
            "We have a flu vaccine. If COVID didn\u2019t come around, we would be have the most exciting year we\u2019ve had with that data from a pivotal Phase III flu trial, where the goal is to use our nanoparticle vaccine that\u2019s adjuvant with Matrix and to have a better flu vaccine than any vaccine that\u2019s out there. And so we\u2019ve been going for the last several years head to head against various vaccines, the most popular marketed vaccines, Fluzone High-Dose.",
            "And we\u2019ve shown consistently in Phase I, Phase II and now a Phase III trial that we have, potentially the world\u2019s best flu vaccine and we have pivotal data that with accelerated approval process that we can use our clinical data to file for BLA in the coming years.",
            "And so we\u2019re excited about that, but of course, everything has become overwhelmed by our newest respiratory vaccine, which is just Coronavirus. And so why is the company here? Well, we make vaccines against viruses and against emerging infectious viruses. And in some sense we\u2019ve been practicing for this pandemic for the last decade.",
            "This is our third Coronavirus vaccine. We did SARS, we did MERS, which showed remarkable potency and safety in those vaccines. And now we have turned toward and focus the entire company on COVID-19. And so we have demonstrated in mice, we have demonstrated in non-human primates and now in people, the ability to have our vaccine safely administered and stimulate very potent neutralizing antibodies, very potent T-cell antibodies, very potent -- with very potent -- very safe immune responses.",
            "And finally, importantly, we have a vaccine which is very stable and being produced and distributed at refrigerated temperatures and at large volumes. And I think -- and we announced today the -- what our global strategy for manufacturing is that we\u2019ve assembled over the past six months, including today\u2019s announcement.",
            "So we partnered with the largest by volume vaccine company in the world Serum Institute and now between Serum Institute and the production facilities we have already established in Europe, in United States and in Asia that we are prepared next year to be able to produce at a level of an excess of 2 billion doses of our vaccines. So that\u2019s where Novavax is right now. It\u2019s exciting year so far and with no letter from sight."

         "Remarks": [
            "It has been an unbelievable year of productivity for you folks, not only in terms of the pipeline, but also in terms of business development. And Stan, you alluded to this towards the end of your comments with regard to manufacturing. But you\u2019ve had to do a lot to fund the development of the COVID vaccine and to ensure access, because it seems to me that you have, if not the best, you have certainly a competitive vaccine with regard to its efficacy and tolerability profile. And I imagine that a lot of people, not only in the United States, but elsewhere are going to have -- are going to want to have access to it. So if you could just help us understand the manufacturing process and your capacity, you mentioned 2 billion. Are you going to be able to produce and distribute a COVID vaccine worldwide in a year?"

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, I mean, of course, it\u2019s a great question and we are a biotech company without licensed product at this point. Having said that, process -- the manufacturing process we have which is a platform that we\u2019ve been using. It\u2019s the same. It\u2019s a very similar production process to what we\u2019ve used in the Phase III flu trial and we also use it to make ebola vaccine and other Coronavirus vaccine.",
            "So it\u2019s a straightforward process where we\u2019re using insect cell manufacturing system to make a recombinant protein. And we simply purify that protein and when we purify it, process we use results in the nanoparticle, which is very immunogenic, provides -- stimulates broad antibody responses. Then we mix that with a -- with an Agilent, with something called Matrix-M, which is opponent based Agilent from a company that we acquired six years ago, which is demonstrated very robust ability to broaden immune response, heightened immune response and in a very safe fashion. So it\u2019s simply formulate and fill that.",
            "So what we\u2019re doing is unprecedented, is we are now -- we\u2019ve now got seven manufacturing sites in seven different companies globally that allows us to, we track transfer, same process to all seven plants at the same time and I don\u2019t believe that anybody\u2019s ever tried to do that before, but this is a pandemic life that we live in. We\u2019ve developed comparability, very robust comparability assays that allow us to say, in each of these plants, when we make product that will be exactly the same from a regulatory point of view.",
            "And so that\u2019s how we\u2019re able to do it. So -- and distribution, recently we partnered with Serum, as they distribute over a billion doses annually to all of the low and middle income countries of the world. We can\u2019t do that. They can\u2026"

            "In the high income countries where we retain the rights, we\u2019re partnered with the Operation Warp Speed and with -- and we will partner with other countries -- with countries who bid for product and there the distribution is not -- is complicated for us. We have to get it to a central distribution site and so we manufacture and get into a central distribution site. And in the U.S. people like CDC and ACIP and an HHS are going to work out the details of distribution. So I think we can -- we\u2019ve set up a global system. This is a global problem. It\u2019s not just the U.S. It\u2019s a global problem. It\u2019s only solved with the global vaccine."

I\u2019m going to shorten it to 2373, if you don\u2019t mind and just maybe bring Dr. Glenn into talk about this. There\u2019s an ongoing Phase IIb in the U.S. and Australia, as well as South Africa. And I\u2019m wondering if you could help us understand really the nature of that study and why it\u2019s being conducted?"

But, yeah, it\u2019s been exciting time, as you probably know well we published our first trial results in the New England Journal a couple weeks ago. And that\u2019s, of course, the peer review process where we\u2019re gratified by the receipt of that.",
            "I think it\u2019s been a very important study. And that data was reviewed by the FDA, as a precursor for us moving on into the next stage of development. So -- and pretty much what you see in the paper is what they were able to review.",
            "So they gave us the thumbs up, that allowed us to move into the Phase II trial in the U.S. and Australia. So what we\u2019re trying to -- what we\u2019re achieving there is to expand the safety database in the over 60-year-old population.",
            "And so, the key sort of the -- this all the data will be helpful. It will all go into the package -- our safety package about the product. But the key portions of that group have been recruited because they\u2019re going to trigger our ability to start the Phase III trial."

      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So we won\u2019t show interim data. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve decided whether we\u2019re going to have a data review on that, but we will show the interim data to the FDA. And in assuming that looks like we did in Phase I, it looks good, that will trigger the start of the U.S. Phase III and we\u2019re projecting that will be in October, probably, mid-October. So imagine to do that we\u2019ve probably got the people recruited and a lot of that underway.",
            "So that\u2019s going very well. What also was triggered by the New England Journal data, if I may call it, was the start of the efficacy study in South Africa. So this is a full blown efficacy study and we went there because it\u2019s a good shot on goal in the sense that there\u2019s a high attack rate, obviously, a large unmet need, we felt, we knew investigators there from previous experience, they were very capable.",
            "And they came to us and said, look, we can not only do an efficacy study in our setting, but we can also include in there some high risk patients that are HIV positive stable and you\u2019ll need that in your experiment."

            "So it really was something to build on the Gates Foundation was quite enthusiastic about it. They\u2019re funding major part of that trial. So that\u2019s going well. That started in August. All of our efficacy studies have harmonized primary endpoints. And so the access of the information, the data collection and the analysis will be very common across these trials.",
            "And we look at these different opportunities is potentially different ways, all different ways to demonstrate the vaccine -- the vaccines\u2019 efficacy. So that the other trial that was triggered by, hope you\u2019re feeling breathless, like, hey, and these are a lot of trials to stand up in a short period of time. But we -- the New England Journal paper also or data also triggered the start of the work on a Phase III trial in the U.K.",
            "That\u2019s going to start shortly in terms of recruiting patients. It\u2019s a large trial. It\u2019s could be a licensure trial for MHRA, which is the U.K. regulators and/or EMA, European, and of course, the data matters for the U.S. So all those are very strong reasons for us to do it.",
            "The U.K. has a healthcare structure embedded in a trial network. So they\u2019re very famously good for doing trials and there\u2019s an uptick. So, again, it\u2019s another -- from an efficacy standpoint another very good self goal for us.",
            "And then, finally, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re shortly to start the Phase III in the U.S., 30,000 subjects, very much aligned with the other U.S. trials that are going, large U.S. trials in terms of endpoint structure, taking advantage of the great work by the -- done by the NIH COVPN network, which is, as this unprecedented collaboration.",
            "And the other thing I should mention is, they have a lot of knowledge about the attack rate. And so is -- this is going to help us, because the -- these are event driven trials and so the speed to the answer is going to be proportional to the attack rate and attack rate is certainly going to be informed by what we know from surveillance. And so in U.S\u2026."

So it\u2019s geographically different. But we have a really good view of that from the work speed and the NIH COVPN network perspective.

And I want to talk about those results in just a minute and talk about the endpoints and the answer, if you will, that you talk about or that you mentioned. But before I do, I wanted to ask you about this Phase II with the adult population, the older adult population, you mentioned greater than 60 years old, perhaps, even the elderly population. But also does it include patients with specific kind of concerns regarding generalized health status, such as diabetes or cardiovascular health. You did mention that South African study that included a stable HIV patients, so tell me a little bit more about that ongoing Phase II then?"

         "Remarks": [
            "So it\u2019s -- these are not -- these are healthy ambulatory patients, who can have a hypertension or diabetes, but very limited. And then as we move into the other populations, I think, you\u2019ll see more population in our safety database with things like hypertension and pre-existing disease.",
            "So right now just showing clearly that in that older adult population we have good immunogenicity and safety. In a way we felt that that was well established with flu. But COVID is a little bit of a different beast and so we agreed with the FDA to supply this information as with everyone else."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. I was going to ask you, I mean, is there any mechanistic rationale, you mentioned or you call out the NanoFlu data, but for patients who may be experiencing more immune senescence, i.e. elderly patients, but even maybe adult -- older adult patients, would you anticipate there to be any fall off in terms of the efficacy?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Charles Duncan"
      },
      "24": {
         "Remarks": [
            "That -- no. Actually, I think, there may be a modest fall off in the immunogenicity. But if you had to look at our immunogenicity, I would say, it really shoots well above the mark. So we did have a good experience with flu, NanoFlu with that population. We know that they\u2019re -- they have some immune senescence.",
            "And one of the features that we saw in our data, which I think is remarkable, our flu data is that, we took a population that largely had very low CD flow of T-cell help and the Matrix-M are adjuvant and the nanoparticle together seem to be very good at inducing T-cell help. We saw that in our Phase II and then we really robustly saw that again in our Phase III trial for flute.",
            "So I think it\u2019s going to be important. I think when you look at our really good neutralizing functional antibody, that\u2019s going to be undergirded by T-health, that\u2019s what drives affinity maturation and therefore the quality of the antibody and just the magnitude, the height of the antibody.",
            "So I expect that we\u2019re going to -- I have every reason to expect we\u2019re going to see the same thing, very robust T-cell help. We saw this in the -- in this young adult population in the trial, so I know what will happen and I think it\u2019s going to be important aspect for conferring protective antibodies in older adults.",
            "We -- we\u2019ve had some experience with other vaccines. Usually some of the immunogenicity falls off a bit. But when you look at our -- the level of, I think, is the -- it\u2019s so very good that I expect that to have really no fall off with the clinical benefit."

         "Remarks": [
            "Excellent. And so it sounds like we\u2019ll get an early even interim read on that in the next coming weeks or so, because you mentioned the Phase III could start in October. I guess regarding that Phase III, let\u2019s talk about endpoints. But before we do, you mentioned a size of trial being roughly 30,000 patients and I know that that is based on an estimate of the attack rate and that\u2019s what other companies have talked about. However, Pfizer has recently expanded their trial, I believe it\u2019s Pfizer, BioNTech, maybe the other one, but they\u2019re all above the kind of 40,000 level. And so, I guess, my question is, first of all, with these other ongoing studies, do you believe that you\u2019ll have sufficient information from other kind of non-traditional cohorts to be included in the primary Phase III, so that you don\u2019t have to expand or is the expansion of trial size a function of attack rate and then we need to talk about what it means to have an attack, which will bring us into the discussion about endpoints?"

We\u2019re worthy -- we\u2019re inheriting a really richly thought through operational and strategic plan here. So that\u2019s a big plus for us, I would say. So, for example, as I was mentioning earlier, there\u2019s a lot of knowledge about incidence of disease. That\u2019s matured in the last two months and so we\u2019re the benefactors of that maturity."

         "Remarks": [
            "So some of the things you see we have been roiling around about underserved populations, et cetera, we\u2019re well aware of that. I think we\u2019ve really got that in hand and that\u2019s a population that has a high attack rate those populations.",
            "So they both serve the purpose of generating good data in those populations to support usage and also for licensure to trial that they\u2019re kind of -- they have those Venn diagrams are really overlapping very nicely.",
            "So we -- these numbers are, the FDA gave guidance on success criteria as a lower bound of a constant of 30. So that\u2019s precision and a point estimate of 50%. So you can do the calculation and come up with some estimates around attack rate, and say, look, well, we need about 140 cases. So that\u2019s the issue. So how do you get to the right number of cases based on those presuppositions.",
            "Now, what we built into our trials, our interim analyses. So if our vaccine efficacy 50%, we need all 140 endpoints to get to the lower bound 30. We expect our vaccine efficacy will actually be quite good based on your experience. I think neutralizing antibody has been shown definitively to be a marker for what should be protected.",
            "So given that, I think, it\u2019s reasonable to expect our vaccine efficacy to be quite high. So we should -- we built into our plan the ability to take an interim look. And then, what I think is especially interesting, we have a overarching data safety monitoring board for these trials. It\u2019s common for the other -- all the other U.S. manufacturers that are testing their vaccine here.",
            "And it has two roles, obviously, one is to protect the safety. So they see everything in an unblinded fashion, so all the safety events. You probably know this, there\u2019s going to be assays, some of the assays are related, somebody steps off the curb, it gets hit by a car, that haven\u2019t really grow."

If they see good efficacy, they can make a recommendation to do that interim analysis, but earlier, based on some reasonable guidelines.",
            "So, I think, that\u2019s very favorable to us that we could potentially have an earlier blind -- unblinded event based on good efficacy. So, 140 is out there at the other end. The numbers could be quite a bit smaller, and of course, that\u2019s time, right, that\u2019s time to do the key event of unblind event."

We had the same thing for the Phase III trial in the U.S. We have an interim look. So we have the ability to go back. You know there we don\u2019t have a DSMB, the way it is organized in U.S. We do have a safety monitoring committee. So that same ability to unblind look at safety, et cetera. But we have that built into our U.K. trial as well.",
