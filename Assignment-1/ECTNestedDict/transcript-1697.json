      "Minoru Watanabe": [
         "Please refer to Page 30 of your material. The next two slides describe projects under development. Ones in orange are in-house projects, while ones with a star are changes made in Q2. I\u2019d like to summarize major items in later slides.",
         "Please go to Page 32, which shows key news flows in Q2. First, as was mentioned earlier, on Enspryng, an in-house anti-IL-6 receptor recycling antibody, or satralizumab, was approved for NMOSD, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, in June in Japan. It also obtained approval in Canada and Switzerland so far. We expect more approvals in other countries as well. ADC against CD79b, polatuzumab vedotin, filed an application for relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL.",
         "FoundationOne CDx cancer genome profile obtained one additional approval as a companion diagnostics and filed an additional application. As a new pipeline entry, Actemra for COVID-19 pneumonia and Hemlibra for acquired hemophilia A, or AHA, began Phase III study, respectively. I am going to explain the details in subsequent slides.",
         "Meanwhile, developments were discontinued for a combination of Tecentriq and Avastin on renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, a combination of Kadcyla and Perjeta as an adjuvant to treat HER2-positive early breast cancer as well as balovaptan for autism spectrum disorder because of unfavorable study results. We presented or published study results for some development and launch products at medical conferences and academic journals, which I\u2019m going to explain in detail in later slides.",
         "Page 33 describes our response to COVID-19, which I\u2019m going to skip the details. To give you an overview. First, we began a clinical study of Actemra, both in Japan and overseas, with an expected application by the year-end. Second, we joined hands with A STAR in Singapore to develop an antibody drug against COVID-19. Third, we actively promote technology transfer to allow a third-party to utilize our above making antibody engineering technologies. These illustrate our multifaceted response to COVID-19.",
         "Page 34 and onwards describe main topics. First, Enspryng was approved to treat anti-aquaporin-4 seropositive NMOSD in both adults and children. Let me add some details here. As the lower diagram shows, the product is the first to adopt our proprietary recycling antibody technology that enables an antibody to repeatedly bind to its antigens unlike ordinary antibodies. This contributes to a significantly longer half life, providing a convenient once-every-4-weeks subcutaneous injection. Positive results were also obtained for both monotherapy and combo therapy with an immunosuppressant. Long-term prevention of relapse and tolerability as well as efficacy for young patients were also confirmed. We are confident that this product is well supported by those rich evidence.",
         "This slide shows an update on nemolizumab, an anti-IL-31 receptor a antibody, which was out-licensed to Maruho in Japan and Galderma elsewhere. Maruho conducted a domestic Phase III study on atopic dermatitis patients and published the results in the New England Journal of Medicine. Primary endpoint was mean percent change in VAS score at 16 weeks. It was shown that the score was down 42.8% in the nemolizumab group compared to 21.4% in the placebo group, suggesting a statistically significant improvement of the score. Moreover, improvements were confirmed in all of the secondary endpoints ranging from change in EASI, DLQI measuring patient QOL and ISI score, measuring the quality of sleep.",
         "This page outlines acquired hemophilia A or AHA, for which Hemlibra began Phase III study. AHA is caused by autoantibodies, which emerge against coagulation Factor VIII for various reasons. This is a rare but severe condition with a high mortality rate. Hemlibra is effective regardless of the presence of the autoantibodies against the coagulation Factor VIII. Therefore, we envisage that this would be able to serve high unmet medical needs and thus decided to initiate the development in Japan.",
         "Please turn to Page 37, which is an update on overall survival data of Phase III ALEX study with Alecensa, which was presented at ASCO 2020. The 5-year survival rate in ITT in the alectinib group was 62.5%, while the hazard ratio was 0.67 versus crizotinib. Moreover, the crizotinib group was allowed to have a crossover with other drugs, including alectinib. The result of this long-term analysis demonstrated the efficacy of alectinib as the first-line therapy.",
         "As a next topic, Page 38 outlines our vision for the future CIT, cancer immunotherapy, centered around Tecentriq for the entire Roche group. Following the second wave focused on combinations with existing medications, we created a third wave of combining different CITs, whereby we obtain data for a combination with anti-TIGIT antibody, which I\u2019m going to present in the next slides.",
         "Page 39 shows the results of the combination of Tecentriq and tiragolumab, an anti-TIGIT antibody as the first-line therapy for NSCLC. In the analysis of ORR with the 10.9-month median follow-up period, the clinically meaningful efficacy was shown in the PD-L1 high population.",
         "Page 40 shows the results of PFS analysis, which demonstrated the clinically meaningful efficacy of the combination in the PD-L1 high population as well. To further analyze the efficacies, Japan is joining efforts to begin global Phase III studies in order to further the development of the combination of Tecentriq and tiragolumab. Page 41 illustrates projected submissions. I am going to skip the explanation for major items, as were already mentioned.",
         "Page 42 shows the current status on the development requests for unapproved drugs and indications. No major updates have been made since January 30. That concludes my presentation. Thank you very much."

      "Tatsuro Kosaka": [
         "I am Tatsuro Kosaka, Chairman and CEO of Chugai Pharmaceutical. Let me review the first half. First, on the financial results of the first half. Please turn to Slide 3. Despite the outbreak of COVID-19, we have seen a significant increase in revenues and profits in the first half of this year and are on the right track, making steady progress in IBI 21, our midterm business plan. As January-June period results, record high numbers in revenues, operating profit and net income with revenues up 14.9%, core operating profit up 38.8% and core EPS up 39.0% year-on-year, respectively.",
         "Reasons for this strong performance include steady exports of Actemra and Hemlibra to Roche and Hemlibra-related income. However, domestic sales suffered a negative growth of 2.6% year-on-year. One reason was because our mainstay products, Actemra and Hemlibra, have their NHI drug prices cut in April. The second reason was the impact of the spread of COVID-19 with Tecentriq and Hemlibra, our growth drivers most severely affected.",
         "Please take a look at Slide 4. As of July 17, our market capitalization stood at about JPY 8.8 trillion, ranking number 7 in the entire country and the number1 in the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, in order to reduce the investment unit price for the company\u2019s stock, increase the liquidity of the shares and to further expand the investor base, we carried out 3-for-1 stock split effective July 1. We will continue to strive to meet the expectation from shareholders and investors and to become a top innovator in the health care industry as a leading Japanese company.",
         "Next, I will discuss the impacts on the business and performance due to the spread of COVID-19. Slide 6 shows the summary of the impacts by COVID-19. Although there were no major negative impacts on the half year results, the progress of business activities was affected to a certain extent. Domestically, there was delay in the market penetrations of growth products, such as Tecentriq and Hemlibra due to restraint in sales activities and reduction in the number of hospitalizations and outpatients, making us slightly behind the plan set at the beginning of the year.",
         "On the other hand, in the overseas business, exports to Roche were favorable despite a temporary delay in switching from the existing therapies to Hemlibra. Exports of Actemra to Roche, including those for clinical trials, increased significantly as well. On the development front, we have experienced delays in the start and progress of some clinical trials, but they are expected to be resolved in the future.",
         "In terms of regulatory affairs and drug discovery, we have seen no significant impact by COVID-19. Stable supply of products is the most important, and under the current circumstances, we have been able to maintain a stable product supply system and are determined to make sure that will continue to be maintained.",
         "As for capital investment, construction works for Chugai Life Science Park Yokohama, or CLSPY, have been temporarily suspended, but all were resumed from June with a limited impact on the overall construction period. In terms of expenses, some were curbed due to the cancellation of overseas business trips and self-restriction on domestic sales activities.",
         "Thus, the impact of COVID-19 on the performance of the first half was limited, but we could be affected more extensively if the outbreak becomes more widespread and prolonged going forward. Furthermore, there are major social and economic impacts of COVID-19, giving us opportunities to revisit every aspect of our business. We will work to capture the changes in the behavior and values of our stakeholders and move ahead with the reforms, keeping the world with and after novel coronavirus in mind.",
         "Please take a look at Slide 7. We\u2019re engaged in development of antibody drugs against COVID-19 in and outside of Japan. Among them is Actemra, for which Roche is currently conducting studies overseas, such as COVACTA study to see the effectiveness of combination therapy with standard of care for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and REMDACTA study to look at the effectiveness of combination with remdesivir.",
         "In Japan, our company is carrying out an open-label Phase III study called J-COVACTA, while consulting with MHLW and PMDA. Based on the result of the clinical study, we are hoping to file for an approval by the end of this year in Japan. Moreover, we\u2019re also working with A STAR, Agency for Science, Technology and Research of Singapore to develop an antibody drug as fast as we can by applying our antibody engineering technology.",
         "Next, I will explain about the progress of strategic policies for 2020 in IBI 21. In the new midterm business plan, IBI 21, we have come up with five strategies under the theme of accelerating corporate and social development through innovation focused on innovative products.",
         "In Slide 10, we have shown the four strategic policies for 2020 as presented at the beginning of this year. Please turn to Slide 11. I will highlight the main achievements in the first half. First, we worked to maximize value of growth drivers. As I said, our growth products, Hemlibra and Tecentriq, were affected by COVID-19 and saw the market penetration lower than expected, but sales steadily increased compared to the year before.",
         "In Tecentriq, sales were mostly derived from non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. However, we have high hopes for an approval for hepatocellular carcinoma by the end of this year. Enspryng, or satralizumab as called in its generic name, was approved in Japan in June. We will aim to launch the product promptly after getting it added to the NHI drug price list. We also expect it to be approved in the U.S. and the EU this year so that it will become our next global product following Actemra, Alecensa and Hemlibra.",
         "With regard to the second policy, creating next-generation growth opportunities. As scheduled, we started a Phase I study for STA551, Switch Antibody. As for nemolizumab, the results of the domestic Phase III study carried out by Maruho were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and domestic filing is planned within this year. A Phase III study for atopic dermatitis is currently underway by Galderma overseas and preparations to initiate a Phase III study for prurigo nodularis are being made as well.",
         "Under the third policy, promoting digital transformation and personalized health care, in March, we filed for approval of FoundationOne Liquid, a liquid biopsy test for blood samples that provides a comprehensive genomic profiling.",
         "On the digitalization front, we came forward with Chugai Digital Vision 2030, where basic strategies are: digital transformation, strengthening of the entire value chain and creation of innovative new drugs using digital technologies. We will execute activities to provide new solutions to transform business and change society.",
         "As specific cases this year, we entered a license agreement with FRONTEO to apply to drug discovery a search AI system and a system to visualize disease mechanism information in the form of pathway map. We also started joint development with Biofourmis of digital technology to objectively evaluate pain associated with endometriosis.",
         "As for the fourth policy, implementing drastic structural reform and strengthening sustainable platforms. Though my duty as CEO remains unchanged, since April, a new management system was initiated, where as Chairman and representative Director, I take responsibility for important decision-makings that will require resolutions at the Board of Directors' meetings, while Mr. Okuda, newly appointed President and COO, takes responsibility for decisions made on execution of operations of the entire company. We also started so-called job-based personnel system in April.",
         "In regard to ESG-related activities, we expressed support for the statement by Japan Climate Initiative, JCI, and the recommendations by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD, in order to help realize decarbonization of society, strengthen governance on measures to fight climate change and conduct scenario analysis of risk and opportunities.",
         "Please move to Slide 12. As was discussed so far, as COVID-19 spread, business progress was affected to a certain extent, but we achieved higher revenue and profits in the first half of fiscal 2020. Although we anticipate to continue to see an uncertain business environment, we will strive to maintain a stable product supply system in preparation for possible second and third waves of COVID-19. Due to the impacts of COVID-19, therapeutic agents and vaccines will be essential to ensure coexistence or prevention of spread of COVID-19 and reopening of the economy. Therefore, as social contributions by the pharmaceutical industry have been drawing renewed attention and expectations for the health care industries are increasing, we will continue to focus on research and development of new therapeutic agents.",
         "Through further promotion and acceleration of digitization, we will work to not just improve the efficiency of the value chain, which is a given, but also to promote AI drug discovery. With the aim of creation of innovative new drugs, we will enhance the capabilities of AI x real-world data x digital biomarkers so that we can pursue truly personalized health care, which can only be realized by Chugai.",
         "We are in the midst of a global pandemic, something totally unexpected but are making steady progress in IBI 21, and we\u2019ll continue to work to achieve management plans aimed at medium-to long-term sustainable growth. That is all from me. Thank you. Next, Toshiaki Itagaki, CFO, will go over the consolidated financial overview of the first half of fiscal 2020."

      "Toshiaki Itagaki": [
         "Good evening. Ladies and gentlemen, I am Toshiaki Itagaki. Please turn to Slide 14. This slide shows the overview, but Mr. Kosaka already discussed this earlier, so let me jump to the next slide and go into more details. Slide 15 shows financial overview of January to June. Revenues totaled JPY 368.1 billion, up JPY 47.8 billion or 14.9% year-on-year. Revenues are divided into two, one of which, sales, went up by JPY 23.3 billion or 8.3% year-on-year; and the other, royalties and other operating income, or ROOI in short, grew by JPY 24.6 billion or 64.9% year-on-year.",
         "To give you the breakdown of each, domestic sales went down slightly by 2.6% due to NHI drug price revisions and the launch of generic drugs, while overseas sales grew significantly by JPY 28.6 billion or 39.5% due to the increased export of Actemra triggered by COVID-19 as well as export of Hemlibra at the ordinary supply price.",
         "Royalty and profit sharing income increased by JPY 23.3 billion due to an increase in royalty income for Hemlibra, and other operating income was pushed up JPY 1.4 billion by an increase in onetime income.",
         "Cost of sales ratio improved by 2.2 percentage points to 42.9% as the share of in-house products in the product mix increased, and the ordinary supply price was \u2013 started to be applied to the export of Hemlibra in fiscal 2020. As for operating expenses, marketing and distribution expense decreased by 1.8%, mainly due to restraints on sales activities, and general and administration expenses also dropped by 4.8% due to declines in various expenses.",
         "On the other hand, investments in R&D increased because of the progress of development projects and reached JPY 52.9 billion, topping a JPY 50 billion mark for the first time for a half year period. As a result, operating profit posted JPY 143.7 billion, up JPY 40.2 billion or 38.8%, with the operating margin reaching 39%. When you subtract financial account balance and income taxes from the operating profit, you will get the net income of JPY 104.5 billion, up JPY 29.4 billion or 39.1%. This represents our highest-ever revenues, operating profit and net income for any January-June period.",
         "Page 16 shows breakdown of sales of products, a year-on-year comparison. On the left, sales by disease area. Starting from the top, overseas sales exceeded JPY 100 billion for the first time, up 39.5%. On the right-hand side, sales by products. Top two growth products were both overseas: Actemra overseas, plus JPY 17.1 billion; and Hemlibra overseas, plus JPY 14.8 billion, respectively. As for Alecensa overseas, sales were down by JPY 3.1 billion or 15.6%. This was due to lower unit export price and the impact of the stronger yen. Export volume actually grew by about 20%.",
         "Going back to the chart on the left, domestic sales, as shown in the middle, totaled JPY 204.6 billion, down 2.6%. At the bottom block, oncology was down 2.1%. By product, Tecentriq and Perjeta, increased, while sales decreased for Avastin, down 12.8%; Herceptin, down 36.8%; Rituxan, down 42.2%; and Xeloda, down 57.4% as they were affected by the NHI drug price revisions and the impact of biosimilar and generic erosions.",
         "Next is bone and joint, down 2.9%. While specific products are not listed in the slide, Actemra sales declined year-on-year as the NHI drug price was reduced by 18.5% due to the market expansion repricing. Renal diseases also declined, down 20.3% with Mircera, down 22.7%. Last but not the least, others, up 7.6%, with Hemlibra domestic sales growing by JPY 7.1 billion. Tamiflu ordinary recorded a decline of 85% as the influenza prevalence was the lowest in 10 years.",
         "Page 17 shows the variance analysis of operating profit increase of JPY 40.2 billion. Second from the left, gross profit from sales increased by JPY 19.5 billion owing to increase in sales, plus JPY 23.3 billion, and improved cost to sales ratio of 2.2 percentage points coming from a change in product mix and export of Hemlibra at a regular price. ROOI increased by JPY 24.6 billion as a combination of an increase in income for Hemlibra and an increase in onetime income. That full amount was reflected in the increase in operating income. Of the increase of JPY 24.6 billion, JPY 15.9 billion was an increase in royalty on the initial shipment of Hemlibra, the so-called royalty two.",
         "As for expenses, M&D and G&A expenses decreased, while R&D expenses increased by JPY 5 billion. For information, the full year forecast at the beginning of the year projected R&D to total JPY 115 billion, up JPY 12.9 billion year-on-year. The actual for the first half was JPY 52.9 billion, up JPY 5 billion. This was largely in line with the budget.",
         "Page 18 shows the quarterly changes in the structure of profit since Q2 2019. This is a new slide. The top half shows structure of revenues and the lower half, structure of cost and profit. In both cases, we are describing how the second quarter results compare to the same period of the previous year and to the previous quarter, the first quarter of this year.",
         "I would not read them all, but in terms of the key points of structure of revenue described in the top half, the second quarter results were characterized by sluggish domestic sales and strong exports, both compared to the previous year and to the previous quarter. ROOI shows the tendency to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due partly to event-driven onetime income. As for the structure of cost and profit shown on the lower half, while there were some ups and downs, both cost of sales ratio and expense ratio decreased, contributing to improved operating profit rate.",
         "While breakdown of expenses is not shown here, as shown in the remarks to the right, R&D expenses increased. Going forward, we plan to contain the M&D expenses and shift the resource allocation more towards R&D.",
         "Page 19 shows structural sales by quarter. As in the previous page, highlights of a year-on-year comparison and a quarter-on-quarter comparison is described on the right. Overseas sales tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter depending on the timing of export. The second quarter benefited from an increase in export of Actemra in relation to COVID-19 and the commencement of export of Hemlibra at a regular export price. Quarterly sales exceeded JPY 50 billion, and the rate of overseas sales to total topped 30%. A significant increase in sales was recorded both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.",
         "As for domestic sales, this turned out to be a very difficult quarter in all disease areas, affected by the NHI drug price revisions last October and in April of this year as well as the launch and market penetration of generic drugs and others.",
         "In terms of progress vis-\u00e0-vis forecast at the beginning of the year, please turn to Page 20. Starting from the third line from the top, domestic sales. Progress rate of 49.7%, higher than last year\u2019s 48%. But considering that downward revisions of NHI drug prices in April would be felt 100% during the second half of the year. Combined with the impact of the market penetration of generic drugs, we actually would have liked to see the progress of over 50%. Partly due to the impact of COVID-19 infection, market penetration of new products and expanded indications was slightly slipping behind our forecast.",
         "Overseas, Actemra export was larger than anticipated, thus a high progress rate of 60%. ROOI, more or less in line with the plan. Cost of sales was also in line with the plan. As for expenses, due to the COVID-19 infection, postponement and cancellation of events concentrated in the second quarter. Accordingly, progress of M&D and G&A expenses was behind the plan. On the other hand, R&D expenses progressed at 46%, almost in line with the plan. In summary, domestic sales were slightly behind, but partly owing to the upside in the overseas sales, revenue and profit were generally making a steady progress. And given that some of the expected expenses were not used, progress of operating income and net income was generally in line with the plan.",
         "This page shows sales per product. Overall, the progress for domestic product sales was faster than last year. However, after NHI price revision in April, five products seem to have an even better progress because of advantages they enjoyed in Q1, namely Avastin, Perjeta, Xeloda, Actemra and Hemlibra. Each of these had a price cut of 15% to 27% plus after the NHI price revision in April because of the expiration of innovation premium and market expansion price cut.",
         "Page 26 in the appendix shows the outline of NHI price revision for each product for your perusal. Next Edirol had a high progress rate because of the first half spared the impact of a generic drug, which is scheduled to be launched in August. There were some other products that had a lower progress rate because of COVID-19 impact. Tecentriq was affected in its market penetration. Gazyva had a slower switch from rituximab. Bonviva had a slightly lower progress than planned because it was either ceased or switched to an oral drug because of its inability to increase the prescription frequency from once per month. Hemlibra had a slightly slower progress than forecast because of the delayed switch from existing therapies.",
         "The progress of overseas products depends on the timing of export. Thus, we cannot generally perform an year-on-year comparison for those products. However, Actemra exceeded our forecast with 66.7% progress. Other overseas products were in line with our forecast. To add, we hereby disclose that Enspryng sold JPY 400 million in actual and is expected to sell JPY 1.6 billion in forecast.",
         "This slide shows a familiar diagram of Hemlibra sales to Roche. Starting from this year, we began exporting at an ordinary supply price. The sales amounted to JPY 15.7 billion for the first half this year compared to JPY 1.6 billion during the same period last year. We were exporting the product at an initial supply price until last year, and the difference with the export price is paid to Chugai as royalty two every time Roche generates sales in their territories. The royalty income doubled from JPY 16.9 billion to JPY 32.8 billion in the first half this year.",
         "This slide also includes a cosmetic modification. In a previous diagram, we used to show until year 2021, which gave some of you a wrong impression that royalty two might be gone after year 2021. We, therefore, extended the far right column to include years beyond 2021 to accurately convey our message. Please take a look.",
         "That was an overview of P&L. I\u2019d like to present the last two slides on balance sheet and cash flow. As shown on Page 23, we maintain a healthy and solid balance sheet. The third line from the bottom indicates the total net assets amounting to JPY 905.9 billion, up JPY 51.9 billion from the end of last year. Lower right, the ratio of equity attributable to Chugai shareholders was as high as 84.5%.",
         "If you could go back to the table on the left, of the JPY 905.9 billion in the total net assets, approximately 70% is maintained as the net operating assets above the double line in the middle at JPY 636.3 billion, up JPY 89.3 billion year-on-year. This is attributable to an increase in net working capital and CapEx as described in the upper right corner. The remaining 30% is maintained as non-operating assets, mostly in net cash, amounting to JPY 290.7 billion.",
         "The next slide shows changes in net cash versus 2019. Net cash was down JPY 42.4 billion from the end of 2019. If you calculate operating cash inflow by combining the second and third items from the left, JPY 157.6 billion minus JPY 61.4 billion, it gives approximately JPY 96 billion, out of which, we invested JPY 47.2 billion to newly construct R&D and manufacturing facilities.",
         "As a result, the operating free cash flow was JPY 49 billion. We then paid income tax and year-end dividends of JPY 40.6 billion and JPY 50.4 billion, respectively. The remaining net cash at hand stood at JPY 290.7 billion as of June 2020. Last year saw a significant rise in profit, resulting in substantial cash outflow and fixed income tax payment as well as year-end dividends in February and March this year, plunging our net cash. However, it remains in line with our forecast. That concludes my presentation. Thank you very much. Next speaker is Dr. Watanabe, presenting the overview of development pipeline."

            "Wakao from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. My first question is your prospects for the second half in your efforts to achieve the full year target operating income of JPY 275 billion. The way I looked at the first half is that even though domestic business was slightly weak, that was offset by export of Actemra, enabling you to achieve the plan for the first half at the level of operating income.",
            "In the second half, though there is a slight concern about a second wave of COVID-19, I thought the target would be achievable as restrictions on sales activities are being loosened, leading to a recovery in the domestic business, while exports of Actemra staying on the steady increase. I wonder what your take on the second half is."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you very much, Mr. Wakao. Itagaki speaking. We\u2019re just at the midpoint of the fiscal year, and there are three reasons why we say we are on the right track so far. The first is exports of Actemra to Roche. Secondly, the fact that the NHI drug price revisions took place in April benefited us, as we applied pre-revision prices in the first quarter. Thirdly, some of the planned expenses remained unused. In that sense, progress toward the full year budget was a bit better. Now in the second half, what will happen to the spread of COVID-19 is a big uncertain factor, but we believe we can achieve our plan. Having said that, in any case, there are uncertain factors about exports of Actemra to Roche, depending on the results of COVACTA study. And therefore, we will have to remain cautious."

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "My second question is about what you just referred to, exports of Actemra. Listening to what you explained, I understand that if Roche\u2019s sales remain strong, a corresponding amount of exports can be posted in July-September period and beyond and that if COVACTA study proves successful, we can expect additional demand for exports. And am I correct in my line of thought? Or is it the case that your exports were made in the second quarter, not taking into account any impact from COVACTA study? And therefore, if COVACTA study does not succeed, your exports from the third quarter onward will slightly lose momentum. Could you give me more details on this point?"

            "Obviously, our exports of Actemra to Roche is driven by the performance of Roche\u2019s sales of Actemra in its territories. In the first quarter, Roche\u2019s sales in its territories, which excludes Chugai\u2019s sales in Japan, grew 29% year-on-year, while our exports dropped by 6%. And so there was a significant time lag. However, we exported a lot in the second quarter. And in the entire 6 months, Roche\u2019s sales grew by 35%, while our exports went up by 39%. And this is telling us that the gap has been mostly closed.",

If it is positive, we believe things will go in the positive direction, though we are not entirely sure whether the current momentum will continue.",

But if you look at royalty income only for Hemlibra, would you say it is also in line with the plan of the first half? With this, am I correct in understanding as follows: in the first quarter, Roche\u2019s sales were strong. But in the second, they became a bit weaker. But Roche\u2019s sales in first quarter were ahead of the plan. They canceled out the weak sales in the second, bringing the Roche\u2019s sales of the first half as a whole to be in line with the plan, which, in turn, resulted in the royalty income in line with the plan."

From the very beginning, regarding the resource allocation, M&D expenses are to be optimized so as to proactively allocate resources to R&D. That has been the framework of the budget, and this trend continues going forward. Now with COVID-19, M&D expenses turned out to be way lower than the budgeted amount during the first half of the year. So what are we going to do about the difference?",

And remote approach, including e-detailing, is what we are going to promote. And we will spend more in those areas. Furthermore, on a company-wide basis, promote digital transformation, including R&D. We will make investments in those areas. So on a full year basis, we want to use the budgeted amount in a very effective and efficient way. That is our intent.",

So while what can we learn from 10 patients or so could be challenging, when favorable results are obtained in the global study with 450 patients, then we can show that the efficacy would most probably be the same for Japanese patients based on the study in Japan using the same criteria, the same evaluation items.

One is when PoC, proof-of-concept, is achieved. And the other is when a paper is issued. We are planning to submit a paper on a journal since this involves the innovative technology of Chugai. We are planning to submit a paper to a journal, and that will be another opportunity. Based on the progress so far, we believe that the latter will come earlier."

But our vision is that with 2030 as a target year, aimed to be the top innovator in the health care industry, by which we mean, given that we have strength in the drug discovery capability, we will leverage that capability so that patients in the world will be hopeful that Chugai will provide effective solutions. Or as we proceed with various collaborations, we want the external partners to be excited that by partnering with Chugai, we can jointly come up with innovative solutions or products. So a company that people will have that kind of association, that\u2019s what we aspire to be.",
            "We say health care industry because it\u2019s no longer just pharmaceutical, but it\u2019s a bit larger than that. With new modalities emerging and digital therapy expanding and early diagnosis and early intervention, we are seeing wider range and scope. And with that, not just pharmaceutical companies but new players are coming into the health care field. And even in that landscape, we want to be regarded as the top innovator. That is the aspiration, and that\u2019s what I was trying to communicate. I hope that helps."

Going forward, however, depending on the retail price for COVID-19, some adjustments may be required to set the shipping price in the future.

Pertaining to the development of Actemra to be indicated for COVID-19, based on your earlier explanation, a bottleneck here for domestic application is the progress of the global clinical study. That means any delay in the domestic study is unlikely to delay an application process in Japan. Am I correct in saying that?

Chugai\u2019s antibody modification technology is helping its optimization. Of course, our strength lies with antibody optimization. As you know, our technology can also produce candidate antibodies in the order of tens of thousand, from which, at best, one can be chosen.

First, on the COVACTA study, to project the sales performance of Actemra, the results of the study are truly important. On July 2, the results of sarilumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, on COVID-19 were revealed. The study was discontinued because it failed to produce positive results. By reading their report, those without mechanical ventilation to maintain the baseline showed a negative trend. In my understanding, sarilumab works under a very similar MOA with Actemra.",
            "The study designs were similar because both target severe patients only and adopt the same 7-point ordinary scale ordinal scale. By examining the effects of remdesivir and other drugs in the past, I have an impression that COVID-19 is a heterogenous virus with still unclear pathology. I think all of these confer your study a high-risk study. To be more specific, how can you differentiate the clinical study of Actemra from that of sarilumab, which recently failed? In particular, does your study include those undergoing mechanical ventilation to protect the baseline? That is my first question."

To be more specific, end points differ. The severity of target patients slightly differ as well. We need to study how these will play out. You rightly pointed out that the virus is heterogenous. Thus, we must ascertain how effective Actemra is on what patients by carefully examining and analyzing the results when available. It will not be easy to obtain clear-cut results. In that sense, the study will enroll and randomize 450 cases, which is a significantly large number. We thus expect to generate at least partially clear answers to those questions."

We need to examine how the drug would work on all of those markers.
