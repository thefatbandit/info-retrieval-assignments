         "Thank you, Tom and welcome everyone.",
         "I'm pleased to be with you today. Now having been in this role over the past three months and haven't had any chance to talk to some of you during that time. As I stated last quarter, PayFac is making great progress and I can say that more emphatically today. The card business got off to a great start this year and had another growth quarter over the past three months.",
         "Revenues, volumes and transactions were all up again in the second quarter, which is more impressive when you consider the significant decreases reported across the industry. We have very little exposure to large are insulated largely from a large degree from retail, restaurant, hospitality and similar verticals that have been bearing the brunt of the economic slowdown. While our dental and veterinarian office were forced to shut down for a time, most are backup and in operation and we expect that business to remain stable if not grow.",
         "So all of the Coronavirus slowed the momentum that built up over the back half of 2019, we have regained our stride with volumes today essentially back at pre-COVID levels. At the same time, there's been no let up in our sales performance. For instance, we announced a number of deals in the legal software space where we're making a concerted effort to become a leader in that large, but highly fragmented market.",
         "We're having similar success in parking management software and other verticals where our technology is truly generating excitement in the ISP community. The pieces are in place for a significant ramp in our volume, and I see my job is unlocking that vast potential. So I've been looking very closely for any pinch points that might be limiting our success or from new opportunities, we're adding resources, or making some changes might accelerate our growth.",
         "Consequently, we've instituted a few changes, I believe we'll make a difference. At the top of that list is a new dedicated implementation team staffed with experienced card processing professionals. Too frequently, our teams are trying to wear too many hats, searching for new opportunities, signing new agreements, and resolving the client issue [indiscernible]. Implementation was consequently not the priority it should have been.",
         "The result was a conversion rate below expectations. Now we have a team who is so focused is to help the ISVs which we've contracted with onboard their merchants as quickly and efficiently as possible. Whether it's troubleshooting an integration issue or helping with the pitches to go out to their customers, our team is skilled and experienced at providing the support needed to get the merchants converted and processing on our platform.",
         "We also added more structure to the team and implemented more standardized processes throughout the organization. This will help improve our overall efficiency, productivity and keep the teams focused. Finally, we're enhancing our business development efforts. We recently hired a new business development professional who was well tendered in the card service space and brings with him existing relationships in the ISV channel.",
         "The opportunity is now and we aim to seize upon it by growing our business development team to quickly capture market share within the ISV segment. I understand you've been patient waiting for the business to inflect and wondering what trajectory it will take. I believe we can inflect at a very steep trajectory for a number of solid reasons. For instance, many of our clients are spending significant dollars and allocating meaningful resources on the integration phase.",
         "Expenses I'm sure they would not have undertaken if they were not intent on making this relationship a success. I know there are several sizable relationships that we've been working with for months, and are literally on the cusp of going live. These are clear indications that there are significant processing volumes to be realized and quickly. So it is our job to serve them well and set them up for success.",
         "And with the changes we've implemented, I believe we're now better prepared to help them succeed. Certainly there are obstacles to overcome. For instance, COVID has hampered development at some of our ISVs, but on balance the business is already sound, it is growing and our target markets are continuing to embrace our technology. The goal now is to improve conversion rates which can result in a steep increase in processing volumes.",
         "This is one of my priorities and you can be assured we're doing everything in our power to achieve this objective.",
         "That concludes our prepared remarks for today. So we would like now to open the call for questions."

      "Houston Frost": [
         "Thank you, Louis.",
         "Prepaid had a solid quarter with revenue up 8% sequentially from the first quarter of this year and 58% compared to the same period last year. It should be noted the card load activity experienced a significant uptick in June growing 123% as compared to May. And then we saw card loads increase again substantially in July by 120%, as compared to June, so a lot of growth in June, and then even more growth in July.",
         "The growth related to our new municipal and non-profit clients was concentrated in the last month of the quarter, and we expect to report substantially larger load and transaction volumes in the third quarter. All told, we have signed 55 new clients in 2020. These clients are actually working with hundreds of additional community organizations, and we have several more in the pipeline.",
         "Most of the client programs became active in June and July. And accordingly as I said before, we expect continued growth in the second half of 2020. It is important to note and Louis mentioned this as well that because of the structure of the programs, more than 50% of the revenue from this activity will be realized after 12 months from the time the card accounts are loaded. This is when we receive income from card over fees and funds exploration.",
         "As such, we expect the activity in 2020 to fuel revenue growth, not just through the end of the year, but in 2021 as well. While the pandemic was the catalyst for much of our recent growth, many of the organizations we've partnered with have the need for money disbursement solutions for a number of other programs, not related to the pandemic. In addition, many of these organizations have introduced us to other cities and/or non-profits.",
         "And so, while we do believe that load volumes related to these programs, may slow a bit in the third quarter, we do feel strongly that we should be able to maintain a substantial portion of the elevated load and transaction volumes in the quarters that follow. Most valuable thing we built this year are new relationships. And if we stay focused on those and we continue to execute well, the prepaid line of business will continue to grow and prosper.",
         "With that, I'd like to conclude my opening remarks and turn the call over to Tom Jewell, our Chief Financial Officer to discuss financial results in greater detail."

         "Thank you, Joe, and welcome, everyone.",
         "The second quarter was much as expected with the Coronavirus temporarily impacting our growth momentum, but with performance progressively improving as we move from April to June and even into July.",
         "In the process, the second quarter demonstrated that our strategy to offer broad portfolio of payment solutions to diversified end markets, which was more resilient than other business models throughout much of our industry. With companies suffering fairly significant revenue decreases because of their more concentrated portfolios and single payment channels.",
         "While our consolidated revenues were down about 3% in the worst economic quarter in recent memory, revenues and our two growth initiatives PayFac and Prepaid were actually up. These two fast growing business lines demonstrate that our innovative technology is in high demand as it offers solutions to make payments simple.",
         "We also worked hard to control costs, with our total overhead down nearly 300,000 or 10% from a year ago. With overall expenses decrease, we're still investing in the growth of our prepaid and card businesses, as we have added operational resources to each of these business units over the past three months.",
         "For the quarter, our net loss was unchanged from the second quarter of 2019 and for the six months, the bottom line is running ahead of a year ago. In the first quarter, we began providing segment reporting in our effort to improve transparency in our revenue disclosure. So let me offer some high level comments by segment.",
         "Despite reports of widespread second quarter payments industry weakness, our credit card transactions in the second quarter were up 26%. In fact, the number of transactions was the highest in the company's history, and the dollars process was the second highest in the company's history.",
         "The card results are particularly impressive as they achieve despite a decline of over $20 million in combined April and May processing volumes, primarily attributable to the mandated closing of our dental offices of veterinarian office clients.",
         "Card revenues were up again this quarter on a year-over-year basis and profitability continues to improve. In a minute, Greg will talk about the exciting developments in card including the creation of a new implementation team in addition of additional business development professionals, and other promising changes we believe will accelerate near term growth.",
         "Overall, our ACH transactions and processing volumes were down from a year ago. The volume was tied to the disbursement in collection of consumer loans, one of our largest industry concentrations, which has been extremely soft. Consumer lending is slowly recovering, and the business remains strong with all of the decrease in the volume strictly attributed to less users, as we continue not only to retain existing clients, but add new ones.",
         "And as we continue to grow our products with RCC and PINless debit products growing very strongly and unhampered by the COVID shutdown, part of our expanding portfolio of products that leverage are not just certification Tier 1 processing designation, which includes direct access to the Federal Reserve and a dedicated bank routing number. We're confident that consumer lending will bounce back and when it does, our ACH will be back at or above record setting levels achieved earlier.",
         "The real standout in the quarter and for the first half of this year has been our prepaid business. For the second quarter, card load volume was up 64%, transaction volumes were up 47%, and revenues were up 58%. This follows a 69% increase in revenues in the first quarter. [Indiscernible] but I do want to note that we believe the best is yet to come.",
         "Our prepaid program supporting government and charitable organizations and their effort to provide governance assistance and relief has been particularly successful, and has been adopted by five of the ten largest cities in the United States.",
         "Note that all of the anticipated revenue from these programs is not recognized in the current period. So these programs are expected to contribute to both our top and bottom lines over the next few quarters as far as revenue to occur in 12 to 24 months in the future.",
         "In our view, load and transaction volumes, and even revenue far understate prepaid success. In fact, card loads have actually tripled over the past few months, which we believe is far more indicative of prepaid's growth.",
         "Heading into the second half of this year, we believe much of the worst is behind us. Our card and prepaid businesses have already rebounded to pre-COVID or even better levels. It's just a matter of time until consumer lending fully recovers.",
         "To support our growth strategy and to provide the resources to fuel operations, we completed a $3 million private placement with a single institutional investor that has a long-term vision on their investments. The fund demonstrated their long-term commitment by purchasing unregistered shares from the company. As a result, our balance sheet is strong and we have the resources needed to implement our strategy and support operations as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives and work our way back to positive operating cash flow from operations.",
         "Let me conclude my remarks with a statement about Coronavirus which continues to affect our daily lives, our operations and the economy. Usio was quick to act to ensure that the health and safety of our employees as we have implemented policies to achieve social distancing, and other safety measures. However, the economic consequences of the pandemics remain. After an awful April, businesses improved sequentially throughout the quarter as well into July.",
         "While card and prepaid revenues, the card and prepaid have returned to \u2013 or exceeded their pre-COVID levels consumer lending is the only segment of our business that is recovering slowly. Thus, we expect it to be a drag on ACH in the third quarter. But every other segment of our business is expected to be up in the case of prepaid the growth could be dramatic.",
         "However, once the economy is back at full swing, we feel very well positioned to resume the strong growth momentum we achieved heading into the second quarter. Leveraging that into potentially even better returns for our shareholders over the long-term.",
         "With that, I'd like to conclude my opening remarks and turn the call over to Houston Frost, our Senior VP of Prepaid Services to talk a little more about that segment."

         "Good afternoon, and welcome to the Usio Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter ending June 30, 2020. [Operator Instructions] Participants of this call are advised that the audio of this conference call is being broadcast live over the Internet and is also being recorded for playback purposes. A replay will be available shortly after the end of the call through November 28, 2020.",
         "I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Hassett of Investor Relations. Please go ahead."

      "Tom Jewell": [
         "Welcome everyone and thanks for joining our call today and your interest in Usio. I'm going to provide a brief review of our financial results before turning the call over to Greg. Looking at the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, revenues for the quarter decreased 3% to $7 million versus $7.2 million in the comparable period. This decrease is significantly less than the revenue decreases being widely reported throughout the industry.",
         "Two of our three reporting segments representing both growth initiatives reported second quarter growth. Revenues were up 58% in the prepaid category and 4% in our credit card category, including 167% growth in our PayFac business. ACH revenues were down approximately 25% due to the weakness in the consumer lending industry as Louis mentioned.",
         "Gross profits decreased 18% to $1.3 million versus $1.6 million in the prior period, and gross margins were down 340 basis points to 18.5% from 21.9% in the prior period. Gross margins reflect a shift in product mix as a result of the growth of the credit card and prepaid categories and a decrease in our highly profitable ACH category.",
         "Other selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.9 million down 6% from $2 million in the prior period. Despite the decrease versus the prior period, we continue to invest wisely in our growth initiatives to enhance capabilities to fuel future growth. Our operating loss was $1.3 million unchanged from the prior period. Adjusted EBITDA loss was approximately $571,000 compared to a loss of $405,000, an incremental loss of $166,000.",
         "We reported a net loss of $1.3 million or $0.10 per share unchanged from the prior period net loss and loss per share. Going on to the six months results, year-to-date revenues were $14.7 million up 7% or $1 million from $13.7 million in the prior period. Gross profits were $3.2 million, up 11% from $2.9 million. Gross margins were 21.8% or up 70 basis points better than the 21.1% gross margins recorded in the prior period.",
         "Other SG&A expenses were $4 million up 21% from $3.6 million in the prior period. The six months adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $765,000 flat to a loss of $731,000 in the prior year. The net loss was $2.1 million or $0.16 per share compared to $2.3 million or $0.18 per share for the year ago period.",
         "As Louis\u2019 mentioned, we continue to have a solid balance sheet with a cash balance of $1.8 million at June 30, 2020. We received gross proceeds of $3 million from private placement in the quarter. Rolling forward to the end of July, our cash balances were approximately $4.6 million. The company's only debt is a PPP loan. The company's loan forgiveness documents have been submitted, requesting full forgiveness of the loan and are in the process of being filed with the Small Business Administration through our lender.",
         "We believe we have the liquidity and financial strength to support both continued investment in our growth initiatives and to fund operations. Although the momentum built up over the past year has been interrupted by the COVID-19 both credit card and prepaid experience sequentially better quarters after a tough April and May and are now back to pre-COVID activity levels. ACH is experiencing a slower recovery.",
         "Our emerging new products RCC and PINless debit are gaining traction. As we continue to work our way through these unprecedented times. We are fortunate we have a solid balance sheet that we believe will support our plans until operations are completely restored to normal.",
         "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Greg."

Okay and then Greg, can you maybe just talk about some of the things that you're going to do different in terms of trying to focus on the ISVs and then focus on merchant boarding. I mean, is this something that had not really been addressed, and it's a new endeavor for you or your plan of action is to attack it differently and how?"

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "That's a great question. As I said in my prepared remarks, there really wasn't a solid planning in place. There wasn't an implementation process that was formalized, documented, and adhere to. The result was that is, the ISVs in various forms of implementation. We fix that by creating this team and a lot of focus around that. We have a specific program management software tool that we use that is Gantt chart oriented that is - it requires a certain amount of information for the plan to be moved to the next phase.",
            "And that's in - it\u2019s resulting in better conversion rates. But we're also working with the ISVs on a marketing standpoint to develop what works best to get their back book of business, whether that's a card behind, webinars, newsletters, there is a variety of different ways we can go about that. But to sum up that question is just, I think there was a lack of structure and discipline around the implementation phase."

         "Remarks": [
            "All right, and then question for Houston. You said you got 55 new accounts year-to-date. How many of those accounts right now are actually generating revenues and at what percentage of - what you guys think they could generate, are they generating revenues?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Gary Prestopino"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "It's a good question. I don't necessarily have an exact percentage for you. I mean, what I'll say is that the contracts are being executed relatively quickly. And so, there is definitely a percentage, 25%, maybe 30% that haven't even ordered their first batch of cards or maybe we've gotten cards out, but they haven't really started loading them yet. So I mean, one number I could just judge on is two weeks ago.",
            "I asked for the number from my Head of Sales and the number was 48. I mean, that might have been even less than two weeks ago. So as of yesterday, we had 55 signed and executed, and I don't have an exact percentage, but - the notion is accurate that not all of those have started generating revenue. The other thing, I really do want to point out and I think this is indicated in the earnings.",
            "But our gross margins decreased obviously for the company, they decreased, but in prepaid, they decreased substantially in - Q2 as compared to Q1. That is because cards are going out and that's a lower margin source of revenue for us. And so, when you see all these cards going out, and then we're invoicing on the actual physical cards or in some cases virtual cards going out, that's the first part of the revenue that we received from a client.",
            "And then over the next call it three to 12 months we get a different chunk of revenue, which is interchange and cardholder transactional fees. And then post 12 months after that, that's when we get a third kind of source of revenue. So, this is why we're reporting on card loading is because it really is the leading indicator first. First we get cards out, then those cards get loaded. We generate revenue as money is spent on those cards.",
            "And then finally, 12 to 24 months later, we're generating additional revenue. So, we really saw the growth in June and then even more in July. So the revenue is delayed from that activity and so you're thinking correctly about kind of that delay I would say."

            "Wanted to continue on pretty different results from your different revenue segments and your diversification strategy really, shown through this quarter with revenue down only 2.7%, ACH down 25%. So if you're only in that business, you would have had a terrible order. Again so the strategy is really working. On ACH in the Q, you talk about a relationship to employment levels?",
            "And on this call, you're talking about more relationship to consumer loans. I assume there is some relationship there. It's hard to get a loan, if you're not employed. You were on about a $9 million a year revenue run rate on ACH, now you're down to about $7 million, and it's hard to grow the entire company if you've got a boat anchor like that in the near term. And I'm guessing that you know, the macro economy is not going to return?",
            "We're at 10% unemployment for at least a year if not longer. So how do you get that back to 9%, and how do you stop that business from being a boat anchor and let the strong growth in the other segments really drive the results?"

            "I don't really like boat anchors Barry, but I understand what you mean. So well, ACH has already hit its bottom in this quarter. So this is going to go up from there. And - again we didn't lose any customers in fact we've been adding customers. So consumer lending is a segment of that ACH business. And it is directly tied to the economy you're right. If you're unemployed, you're probably not going to get a loan",
            "And then the lenders are not requiring people to payback their loans like they were before the pandemic. So they're offering deferrals. We're seeing that they're starting more and more payments being made, but - and it's recovering. But it's not recovering like the dental office and a veterinarian office, that traffic in April, it was down to 10 million in May, it was down 11 million. And then in July, it popped back up to levels above COVID. And so we're just helping you understand - the world understand, we're not going to see that type of turnaround with ACH where it just pops back, but we're confident that it will come back.",
            "And so, you know that what you call [indiscernible] is still a very stable force within the company. And when you combine that stable force, it's not going - it\u2019s already hit its bottom. With the growth that's occurring in card and prepaid. Q3 is going to be a lot better than Q2. And we're already experiencing July was amazing."

            "Okay, and then prepaid pretty incredible numbers, you've given a lot of data points on card loading and pretty tremendous acceleration. Obviously continuing into the third quarter, you had one sentence in the script that I want to highlight, which was about spoilage. I'm trying to size that and understand that you talked about 12 to 24 months in terms of recognizing spoilage revenue and I guess that varies by customer agreement?",
            "I don't think you've given any - you've given growth rates on the loading, but you've never given the dollar amount of the load so we - got to get a sense of that. Could you give me any more information to help me size what - revenue from spoilage might look like in that, 12 to 24-month timeframe, when you start recognizing it, because I'm guessing that could be a material source of revenue?"

         "Remarks": [
            "It\u2019s is definitely going to be material and we can't tell you what the conversion rate is going to be, what the breakage is going to be on these cards. It\u2019s definitely going to be a nice percentage. Card loading as Houston said, is the best leading indicator of future revenue in that business segment. Money has to get on cards before we get paid in either in terms of purchases or in fees generated from ATMs or they leave $0.58 on a card and the card expires and we earn-in as spoilage revenue.",
            "Some of the card programs are putting out, the spoilage kicks in 12 months someone kicks much as three years later. So, what's really great about what's occurring now and the message that we're trying to make sure everybody understands is all this growth is currently prepaid. And again, you haven't seen it - all of it, yet. The best is yet to come. It\u2019s not only going to help this year, it's helping next year and the year after.",
            "And it's substantial. If you look at our balance sheet, you'll see in the prepaid balance column, this time last year, there was $500,000 on card programs in the card loading database, waiting to go on the cards. When we closed this quarter, it was 20 million so that's the type of delta that we're seeing right now. And that's a snapshot, right because it's a balance sheet. That was what it was on that day. So more than that, it's actually going on the cards."

            "And continue on that. I think you've said in the past you've given spoilage rates, which I think are inversely related to the amount that's loaded on a card. So a card with $500 has less spoilage than a card with $25 for example. Could you kind of, repeat what those numbers are? And then on some of these municipal accounts where I think you're seeing, some of the strong growth, could you describe what's the size of the average load per card is, again to help me better estimate what spoilage revenue might be?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, so I'll let Houston's answer about the current programs. But the industry averages are and kind of a rule of thumb is like a $20 rebate card, that maybe you get for purchasing some tires, is going to spoil, around 40% of the time. Almost one out of two cards are going to go unused as compared to like a $200 card that's going to spoil less than 5%. So you're right as there's more money on the card, less likely that the core card is going to spoil.",
            "But there's still going to be some type of spoilage or what we call breakage when they leave a little bit of money. But like Houston talked about are actual new programs."

      },
      "32": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, so I mean Louis is exactly right on kind of those numbers. You have a really wide range, depending on dollar amount on the card could be 40% on a $20 card that's a good industry average, less than 5%, on a $5 card. In addition to that several of the municipalities are going get back, a portion of spoilage. I mean, that's one of - that's part of the benefits of using a prepaid product.",
            "But there's also several clients that, the cards run at a little bit of a different model where there's and inactivity fee there. But there's not direct spoilage and then there's a sheet that can happen, in three years or later. I mean, one way to try and correlate it and it is, you know if our loads were up 690% kind of year-over-year, which is what we reported in a our recent press release. Ultimately that should lead to revenue growth down the road, call it, over the next 24 months, somewhat similar numbers.",
            "Now, because of revenue spread out, you're going to see that revenue growth necessarily, kind of a comparable from one month to another, but if you start looking at revenue over 12 months, that may not be the worst estimate. If you go back and you look at 2019 revenue numbers and you think about what, sort of second half of 2020. And in the first few quarters of 2021 could be, it may stick, really be fairly close to that kind of growth number in terms of revenue over a 12-month or 18-month timeframe.",
            "So, we think that's a good indicator, obviously, the mixing revenue is a little bit different. And there was a question, I want to go back and answer in terms of what are the values of the cards? A lot of these cards are higher dollar value. They're $600, even $1,200. We also have several programs that are actually doing smaller dollar cards, and those are kind of for different purposes.",
            "So, I think it really is going to depend a little bit on how the mix sort of works out and we're really trying to crunch some numbers to get a better idea on that. But the general idea is, you should be able to look at the growth rate and lows. And that should correlate fairly well to what the growth rate and revenue is going to be, kind of over the next six to 18 months if you will."

So, if an ISP comes to us, we sign and integrate them as a master merchant, board them as a sub-merchant, and they have use a number of 500 subscribers, getting that 500 to convert real time for at the same time has not been the case.

But when it comes to resource allocation, and or time on the IT shots, sometimes it's not a priority for the organization.",

But COVID has exacerbated because those resources that may have been allocated - may not be available at this point.
