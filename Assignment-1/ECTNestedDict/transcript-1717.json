         "Thank you, Christine. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to Smartsheet's second quarter of fiscal year 2021 earnings call. We will be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close today. With me today are Smartsheet's CEO, Mark Mader; and our CFO, Jennifer Ceran. Our Chief Product Officer, Gene Farrell will be also be available during the Q&A.",
         "Today's call is being webcast and will also be available for replay on our Investor Relations website at investors.smartsheet.com. There is a slide presentation that accompanies Jennifer's prepared remarks, which can be viewed in the Events section of our Investor Relations website.",
         "During this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events, financial trends and our expectations around the impact of COVID-19 on our business. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and other factors, including but not limited to those described in our SEC filings available on our Investor Relations website and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.",
         "Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our actual results may differ materially and adversely. All forward-looking statements made during this call are based on information available to us as of today and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events except as required by law.",
         "In addition to the U.S. GAAP financials, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is available in the presentation that accompanies this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website.",
         "With that, let me turn the call over to Mark."

      "Jennifer Ceran": [
         "Thanks, Mark, and welcome everyone. Overall, we delivered financial results above the guidance we issued last quarter, which reflected improving buying trends from customers. Revenue came in at $91.2 million, up 41% year-over-year, and billings were $97.3 million, up 22% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating loss and free cash outflow also came in better than expected at $7.4 million and $4.4 million respectively.",
         "We remained well capitalized with $546 million of cash on the balance sheet and no debt at the end of the quarter. Following our recent acquisition announcement, we plan to use approximately $124 million of our cash for the purchase of Brandfolder, which we expect to close this month.",
         "Next, I'll provide more color on our second quarter financial results. Unless otherwise stated, all references to our expenses and operating results are on a non-GAAP basis and are reconciled to our GAAP results in the earnings release and presentation that was posted before the call.",
         "As we mentioned, second quarter revenue came in at $91.2 million, up 41% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $83.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of 43%. And services revenue was $7.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of 20%.",
         "Turning to billings. Second quarter billings came in at $97.3 million, which exceeded our guidance as we saw a steady improvement in purchases from customers throughout the quarter. As a result, we ended our formal COVID accommodation program at the end of June. As a reminder, this program offered customers who are materially impacted by COVID, extended payment or quarterly or semi annual billings terms. The estimated impact on billings from these special terms in the second quarter was approximately $2 million.",
         "And for the quarter, approximately 89% of our subscription billings were annual with 8% monthly, Quarterly, semi annual and multi year billings represented 3% of the total, and this is consistent with what we saw in the prior quarter.",
         "Moving on to reported metrics, we now have 10,049 customers paying us $5,000 or more per year, 1,131 paying more than $50,000 or more per year, and 433 now paying us $500,000 or more per year. These customer segments grew 31%, 78% and 92% versus a year ago respectively, and now represent 78%, 41% and 28% of total ARR.",
         "Our domain average annualized contract value or ACV grew 40% year-over-year to $4,156. And we ended the quarter with a dollar-based net retention rate of 128%, in line with the guidance we provided on our Q1 call. Full churn rate was stable and rounded up to 8%. We expect our dollar-based net retention rate to remain under pressure, until we lap the headwinds we've experienced this year. As such, we expect our dollar-based net retention rate to trend down to the mid 120s in Q3.",
         "Turning to gross margin, our total gross margin was 82%, one percentage point higher than the prior quarter, driven predominantly by subscription revenue representing a higher proportion of our revenue mix this quarter. Our subscription gross margin was stable at 87%. During the quarter, we substantially completed our migration to the public cloud, which will help us to scale and plan for in-country data residency.",
         "Moving to operating expenses. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was 51%, approximately 7 percentage points better than the prior quarter and 4 percentage points better than the year ago quarter. The improvement was driven predominantly by lower marketing and travel expenses. Note, we expect to see an increase in marketing investments in the back half of the year for ENGAGE, our annual customer conference, and other marketing programs.",
         "Research and development as a percentage of revenue was 24%, in line with the prior quarter and approximately 5 percentage points better than the year ago quarter. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was 14%, in line with historical ranges.",
         "Operating loss in the quarter was $7.4 million, and free cash flow was negative $4.4 million. Cash burn was lower than expected due to stronger collections in the quarter combined with cost management. Our personnel expenses represented 73% of our total expenses.",
         "Let me move on to guidance. As Mark mentioned, we announced the acquisition of Brandfolder on August 24 for approximately $155 million in cash and stock. We expect Brandfolder to close later this month and to contribute approximately $2 million to revenue and $6 million to billings this fiscal year. Additionally, we expect the incremental impact to second half operating loss to be negative $10 million.",
         "Brandfolder has been operating at cash flow breakeven and we expect to spend an incremental $2 million of free cash flow in the second half of fiscal year \u201821 to support their growth and integration into Smartsheet. For purposes of our guidance below, we are including the expected results of Brandfolder as if the transaction closes as expected in mid-September.",
         "For the third fiscal quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $94 million to $95 million, billings to be in the range of $104 million to $106 million, operating loss to be in the range of $28 million to $26 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to between $0.23 and $0.22 based on weighted average shares outstanding of $125 million. Our free cash outflow is expected to be in the range of $10 million and $8 million.",
         "For the full fiscal year, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $367 million to $373 million, operating loss to be in the range of $66 million to $60 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be between $0.54 and $0.49 for the year based on approximately $120 million weighted average shares outstanding. We expect free cash flow outflow to be at least $30 million for the full fiscal year.",
         "And with that, I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator?"
      ],
      "Mark Mader": [
         "Thanks, Aaron. And welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings call. Q2 results exceeded the guidance we provided on our Q1 earnings call. Revenue was $91.2 million, up 41% year-over-year and billings were $97.3 million, up 22% year-over-year. These results are a reflection of the stabilization we're seeing in the market and the green shoot signals we're seeing from customers.",
         "We're confident in the value of our offerings, the investments we\u2019re making in our future and our opportunity to help enterprises adapt to a reality that demands rapid transformation.",
         "We added 500,000 new users in Q2, the largest sequential increase we've seen in the last eight quarters that brings our total number of both paid users and collaborators to over 7 million. This reflects the fact that our value proposition is resonating with customers.",
         "Expansion within our base included 235 companies increasing their annual recurring revenue or ARR by more than $25,000, up from 173 in Q1; 79 increasing their ARR by more than $50,000, up from 51 in Q1; and 19 increasing their ARR by more than $100,000, up from 15 in Q1. These expansions despite the macroeconomic headwinds reflect a wide range of customers leaning in on their use of Smartsheet to empower their people and teams to address critical challenges, including those presented by COVID.",
         "It reinforces the findings of a recent Harvard Business Review study that found that 80% of business respondents agreed that agile and innovative employees enabled by the right technology have played a big part in ensuring business continuity and success during the pandemic\u2019s disruption.",
         "Global Medical Response, GMR, an organization with 38,000 clinicians and support personnel in more than 4000 communities has increased its use of Smartsheet, specifically our dashboard capabilities to communicate COVID-related treatment data to government agencies, track consumption of PPE, and provide real time information to the national communications hub in Dallas. Doing so enables GMR\u2019s leaders to make faster, more informed decisions that ultimately better serve critically ill patients.",
         "One of the world's most disruptive companies known for its on demand transportation and food delivery businesses, leverages Smartsheet forms, control center, and dashboard capabilities to drive their global marketing campaigns, including intake requests, launch and execution efforts, and multi-stakeholder reporting.",
         "The global CRM campaign team reports dramatic benefits since implementing Smartsheet, including increased return on ad spend, shorter campaign cycle times, the reduction in tools required to execute thousands of campaigns, and increased campaign volume per project manager.",
         "In addition to expansion within existing customers, we saw some noteworthy new deals in Q2. For example, the largest network of pediatric medical practices in the US invested in Smartsheet to drive a standardized process by which to manage a rapidly expanding portfolio of acquisitions.",
         "Our M&A accelerator served as the foundation of the six-figured deal in Q2 and provides the customer with consistency and visibility across their M&A projects and processes.",
         "COVID and the challenges associated with it are simply another reminder that the only constant in the world is change. Businesses, regardless of size are seeking new ways to address the pressures, changing expectations in a digitally transforming world.",
         "A significant part of the challenge is that many businesses continue to labor under the belief that simply digitizing or using cloud-based versions of their traditional collaboration, workflow, and content management apps will solve the problem. We believe that is only a partial solve.",
         "A lack of integration between these apps means that critical information about the work being undertaken does not flow easily and quickly throughout the organization, inevitably resulting in missed opportunities and inefficiencies. These well-intended, but cumbersome solutions leave enterprises ill prepared for a reality that demands rapid transformation.",
         "To effectively compete, businesses must work more dynamically to simplify, streamline, and integrate how work is initiated, managed, and delivered by the people and by their teams. The future of work is about creating impact from the edge, empowering individual users and teams to innovate for the company as part of a dynamic workforce. Achieving this means empowering people as agents of change by both enabling and integrating three key areas.",
         "One, the ability for them to dynamically act in the moment, not just collaborating with colleagues, vendors, and customers, but having that collaboration lead to action in real time.",
         "Two, to create and shape flows that are right for the challenges and the teams involved; and three to impact the business by bringing more than a project to completion, but making the most of change, actually improving and innovating processes in a way that creates true competitive advantage.",
         "Successful businesses will achieve maximum impact by their ability to work dynamically in how they collaborate and build effective workflows. Among other things, those workflows are the means by which digital content is distributed through marketing activities, sales motions, and nearly all other day-to-day business operations.",
         "With our acquisition of Brandfolder announced on August 24 and its leading digital asset and content management capabilities, we strengthened our platform for dynamic work with a solution that both deepens cross-team collaboration and enables content workflows and distribution.",
         "In addition to supporting the logistics of digital content workflows, Brandfolder\u2019s capabilities provide insights and analysis on the discoverability and usage of assets throughout the entire content lifecycle for both internal and external stakeholders.",
         "Along with the resource management capabilities we offer via 10,000 feet, Brandfolder deepens Smartsheet\u2019s ability to deliver a set of elite, end-to-end capabilities for marketers to become the application for delivering excellence in marketing operations.",
         "By offering an expanding range of marketing specific capabilities and solutions that integrate with our core platform, we enable marketing teams to dynamically execute, distribute, and report on the effectiveness of their work. We introduced other meaningful enhancements to our product this quarter, among them a new admin center, which provides an enterprise class experience for our SysAdmin community and streamlines how our largest customers manage, govern, and act on information regarding their accounts.",
         "Control Center is part of our Smartsheet Gov offering. Control Center now provides consistency and visibility at scale by automating project creation, aggregating portfolio reporting, and managing change while adhering to the federal government security and compliance requirements.",
         "And Bridge, a no code business process automation engine that triggers actions and can enable cross platform workflow orchestration. Soft launched in early July, Bridge has generated significant interest among our largest customers and will make a meaningful impact on how they connect their data across platforms.",
         "We look forward to unveiling additional product offerings and enhancements at our Fourth Annual ENGAGE Global Customer Conference on October 1. Hosted as a virtual event, we have received over 25,000 registrations with almost a month to go. We are very encouraged by this early response, and we hope you'll join us again this year.",
         "Finally, and before I close my comments, I'd like to touch briefly on our success attracting world class leadership talent at all levels of the team. Since the beginning of the year, we've added several senior leaders, with operating experience from companies such as ServiceNow, Amazon, and Microsoft to help us scale the business. I'm energized by the new ideas these leaders are bringing to the table, and I look forward to the results they'll help deliver.",
         "With that, let me now turn the call over to Jenny to provide additional details on our financial results. Jenny?"

My first question, maybe Mark for you, seeing these larger customers, 100 k or 500 k, that's vastly different than 5,000 k, I'm not that bright, but I can see the big difference there. I'm curious though, what are the cohorts of those larger customers look like? Do they tend to be larger businesses or are they just more of a, like a mid-market business that\u2019s very digital and nimble and they just use a lot of the capabilities to power that business? Are you starting to see any kind of trends in terms of the type of business that is these more sizable ASPs? That's the first question."

However, as you look to provide additional value to customers through capabilities now with Brandfolder as well, there are companies that I would class as midsize who could absolutely be six figure customers of Smartsheet. But to date, the mapping is largely size of customer typically trends with higher ARR."

With respect to Australia, we just got started this year, we're just finishing ramp of about 20 quota carrying reps and so it's still relatively small, but we see a big opportunity there."

I guess maybe the first one for Mark, can you go through kind of, you know, what you saw specifically in the field around the improvements that you talked about on the call in terms of the deal cycles, the pipelines, and kind of where -- as we are coming out of August, any update on kind of how that's trending?",
            "And then for Jenny, maybe, are we past the - you know, when do we, in your mind start to trough on that dollar-based net expansion metric, and ultimately start to kind of come back up?"

And while conversion rates against that pipeline are not yet at pre-COVID levels, we did see stair-step improvement throughout, so that was really good to see.",
            "We did have our largest pipeline build month just set again in August. So, customers are engaging in conversation. They're interested in how we can add value, and you know, we're hopefully looking to extend this pattern into the second half."

            "And then with respect to the retention rate, we are still kind of in the midst of the initial - some of the initial downgrades and expansion pressures we saw starting in April as a result of COVID. So, we're going to need to get through the 12-month period before we start seeing dollar net retention rate improve. We do see that it will, it could improve, but we could see dollar net retention rate kind of coming into the end of the year at somewhere in the low 120s to mid 120s."

            "On the Fed side, we did have our best quarter to date, which was great for the team to see. You know, in the grand scheme of things, it's still a small contributor, but it was really good to see the team take a step in the right direction."

            "Great. And then Jenny on the billings, I want to dig into that. I mean, you had a nice outperformance here. Maybe you could talk about the components of that, and also with respect to your billings guidance, if I take Brandfolder out of it, somewhere around 100 million, I guess billings for your core Smartsheet growth, excluding Brandfolder, which means low 20s growth, so you're not really assuming an acceleration again in billings, in year-over-year billings, right. It doesn't sound like you're seeing or you're not confident enough that billings will accelerate from this quarter that you just reported?"

So, if you think about their contribution to Q3 billings, it's actually quite small. So, there is an acceleration in the organic business."

SMB, still, you know, not quite back to where they need to be. We're still - they're still living some of the pressures of COVID, but we saw really nice growth in our larger enterprises, for sure."

And Jenny, maybe I just wanted to follow-up on that last point a little bit about strength in the enterprise, certainly good to see the 70 -- 79 expansions over 50 k. But I'm just curious when you're seeing these large expansions come through, are these new deals that are coming into the pipeline from customers looking to kind of urgently deploy Smartsheet? Or are these deals that were in the pipeline at the beginning of the year that are just now starting to close as customers get a little bit more confident on the macro outlook? Just maybe trying to understand the dynamics on the larger expansion deals that you closed this quarter?"

So the discoverability of these opportunities are still in a fairly short fuse. I would say I wouldn't class them necessarily as urgent. People are being mindful about our business. I think there's extra scrutiny that they're applying and they're trying to have unlocks. So we're trying to be very responsive to those situations.",
            "I think one of the things that's encouraging to see is, you know, we talk about 50 k opportunities, 100 k opportunities. This was also a big quarter for us in the sense that we now have 10 customers who pay us over a $1 million in ARR. And it's a testament to the team's ability to really elevate the value at substantial levels. And, you know, that's part of our ongoing strategies, we built this business."

And we really chose that name because we believe it's such a broad base need across so many different industries and consistent with the signal that we hear from customers.",

And we believe that it brings a first class experience to our platform, and the addition of content and the way we can deeply integrate content creation workflows, content distribution, workflows, the whole mark-up and approval process and interplay between where the content is managed, stored and shared along with the workflow engine, we think will be differentiating.",

We think that empowering a team to be able to configure end to end with our platform is going to be a differentiator for us."

I guess how should we think about that difference, some of it is obviously with ENGAGE, but for the \u2013 maybe for the balance how much of that is investment, maybe I don\u2019t know, additional sales or marketing efforts given the improvement that you're seeing in the macro?"

The Bridge offering does really provide additional value to core IT and the citizen developer as well. So I think with RPA, it's a really great platform that targets very, usually very large workflows that are less than nimble or requiring less dynamic work or change. It's more I shouldn't say set it and forget it, but it's much more heavy upfront investment on a very known very deliberate process.",

As you kind of go forward and whenever there's a post pandemic environment, how you think about kind of the permanence of some of these you know, COVID related cost savings, you know, are some of that can be permanent is it going to snack kind of back to normal, you know, T&E budget and spending is there going to be some middle ground there, any color there, direction would be helpful?

So I think there's going to be some benefits you see there.",

Or did you actually see a relatively more improvement in the paid user ads this quarter?"

            "Yeah, it's, it's really tough to say, Mark, because when your business that runs multiple campaigns makes a number of improvements, it's tough to attribute what caused it. So was it COVID? Was it the fact that our team substantially completed AWS and the app performance increased dramatically? Like there are a number of factors that could influence it. So I think it is - I think it's easy to sort of revisionist history and say, this is what caused it. I think there are certain things that we did do that created a better experience which may have served as a tailwind for us. But I would not say that - I don't think we know enough yet to be able to say declaratively that COVID was the reason.",

As a follow up, Jenny, I understand it's very early to know with any kind of certainty, but just given what you can see today, would you think that fiscal \u201822 is shaping up to be a year of revenue reacceleration? Or do you think you'd still be kind of working through the lag effect of slower billings here in Q1 and Q2 and Q3, and therefore, maybe deceleration is a little more appropriate thought?"

I wanted to go back to that retention rate because I'm a little surprised that you expected to decelerate from here. I'm not surprised that it came down in July at all. But if I think about the two drivers churn and upsell, you've talked about the pipeline looks really promising and big deal. So I would assume that the upsell stays relatively constant.",

What do you expect to get worse over the next couple quarters between the two key variables of churn and upsell that would drive net retention lower?"

            "Yeah - sorry, our churns have been stable, but losing full logos where we've seen on a degradation is on our expansion business. So net expansion, that would be upsells and downgrades, and it's still a very good number. But we've had more downgrades this year, as a result of, for example, companies like in the travel industry who aren't generating any revenue at renewal, they're downgrading.",
            "Now, I think there's a high likelihood they're going to come back when their business gets back. But it takes basically four quarters for that to flow through our dollar net retention rate because we look back 12 months ago, and so it stays in our calculation for four full quarters.",
            "I don't really know what Q4 is going to be yet. But I do feel that there's more downward pressure right now, because of this phenomenon, and how it's calculated, at the same time and we get to Q1 of next year, I see there's potentially a tailwind on that."

            "And then b, I'm sure you know, that Asana filed and they seem to be growing quite a bit faster than you are in particularly even if you just look at the April quarter their results versus your results. And while that may not be the benchmark for the current quarter, just wanted to know if you wanted to offer any thoughts on because I'm sure we're going to get the question on why Asana is growing so much smaller? I mean, so much faster is a bit smaller than you want to. But any thoughts there would be appreciated? Thank you."

We have not seen a material change in who we see we deeply inspect this. We look at our sales force comments, we talk to our sales team, we talk to our sales leaders, and the number of contested opportunities is still de minimis in the grand scheme of things.",
            "And I think partly that's a function of people flying at different elevations, right. So as we go into talk someone about an enterprise workflow with control center dynamic view, our capabilities, and you compare that against another provider who maybe is more task-oriented, they may be talking two [ph] different things, and we may never see that other person. So, so that's sort of, I think, when the diversity in what people are deploying there has been such a dramatic shift in the last decade, going from relatively few technology providers to a multitude of providers within a company.",
            " Over time, do I think companies will choose their winners and choose the people who they really want to go big with? I do think so. But we're still in this real proliferation, when people are understanding what the possibilities are. So on the growth side, when we look at - I've spoken to the texture of revenue before, so are you are you getting $1 of ARR from a Fortune 500 company with tremendous growth opportunity, you're getting $1 revenue from a smaller business that maybe has slower growth prospects. We're really focused on continuing to pursue and cater all customers but to be very mindful of how we serve those very capable firms that have long, long lives. And the penetration in our Fortune 5 global 2, it's very high AND improving and I think that's one of the things that we still remain very fixated on when we think about how we're performing relative to others."
