      "Jan Karas": [
         "Thank you very much, operator, and good afternoon, and good morning to everybody. Welcome to OPAP\u2019s second quarter 2020 Investor Conference Call.",
         "Although trying to grow in business, amid these turbulent times has been a real challenge. We believe that the Q2 figures demonstrate that OPAP is well placed to face challenges. That's why we will start with our CFO, Pavel Mucha, who will comment on the quarter's financial results. I will then provide you with an update of our business progress and future developments. We will then answer any questions you might have. Pavel, over to you.",
         "Thank you, Pavel. Let's go for an operational review of our business for the quarter, so starting with our retail channel on Slide 17. Right in the COVID outbreak, we have put all of our efforts into supporting our agents during the lockdown and the subsequent gradually opening period.",
         "In more detail, we help them minimize liquidity issues during the closure period, we prepare a set of guidelines to help them benefit from the various governance measures, while we also provided with the data support whenever needed. At the same time, we're continuing on the path of our estate development by building and upgrading 153 stores in Q2, aiming for completing more than 300 by the end of the year.",
         "Additionally, we have proceeded across the entire network with a satellite infrastructure upgrade, enabling mortgage and all high definition content transmission. Powerspin, our new game is one of the first successful examples using this new technology. On top more than 1,000 stores as of today have been equipped with smart digital infrastructure that allows for centralized screens content management, digital communication, and creations of various gaming zones within one store.",
         "Finally, video walls representing the best audio/visual experience will represent in around 140 of our stores. All these elements are further enhancing our customer proposition, pursuing the local entertainment destination ambition. Set aside the changes and enhancements visible to the customer, a lot is continuing to happen also in the back end of our operations.",
         "In July end in cooperation with Salesforce, we have introduced our new B2B CRM, form making another important step in the digitalization of our back office. In essence, Salesforce is becoming the main collaboration tool of OPAP sales and network support teams incorporating all the network processes in a single system.",
         "At the same time, it enables real-time store view for both headquarters and from partners. We are also continuing our OPAP fleet initiative that aims at rewarding the best performing agents through various incentives.",
         "As for the VLTs on Slide 18, although both revenue and active customers obviously declined when taking into account the VLTs were not operational for more than two sets of the quarter. We continued with a set of successful initiatives, fully supporting our reopening in June. We have launched four new games, raising our game portfolio to a total of 100, while holding several initiatives such as loyalty programs and local thematic events.",
         "We also aim to optimize both our jackpots offering as well as our cabinet mix, having already reshuffled around 600 VLTs show us to better meet players' demands. Actually as a result of these actions, and as seen Slide 19, GGR per VLT per day of these machines that has been operational for a year came in at \u20ac44 in Q2, demonstrating a clear sequential improvement versus all the previous quarters.",
         "Admittedly, this is also a result of the urge of the players to resume their playing activity post the lockdown, but it is still indicative of the VLTs business dynamics now contributing for more than 20% of the group GGR.",
         "Sports betting-wise on Slide 20 and 21, we continue to enhance our sports book following best practices across the industry. Licensing is now almost 50% of best place with SSBT accounting for more than 34% of the wagers. In addition, virtuals have gain ground on back of a successful product re-launch and customers' interests shift due to the lack of sports events in early Q2.",
         "That said, the restart of major leagues in June and the conclusion of the European Champions League in August led to an increase year-over-year betting revenues between June and August, but more importantly made clear that sports leagues and events can and most probably will now continue to happen, obviously adapting to the new norm with no or limited teams fans present at the venues.",
         "Overall, given the situation, we have satisfied with the games performance, but now that the delayed conclusion of most league seasons is also meaning that 2020 and 2021 leagues will start later thus causing a shift in late August-September revenues.",
         "The last day of Q2 was marked by the introduction of Powerspin across the whole of OPAP stores estate. As seen on Slide 22, this new game is further enriching our wide portfolio of OPAP games and perfectly complementing our players' experience. The game's awareness has been supported by launch campaign, providing with encouraging early performance science.",
         "On the online front and Slide 23, revenues has been sustained at the high levels with both Stoiximan and Joker demonstrating materially improved year-over-year performance. GGR moves from just \u20ac2.4 million in Q2 2019 to \u20ac10 million in Q2 2020 at the same time also generating increased quarter on quarter sequential numbers.",
         "Both registered an active customers also increased despite the fact that retail reopen again in May. Specifically, our active base reached new historical highs of 140,000 players in Q2, primarily driven from Joker acquisitions and effective marketing campaigns.",
         "Online betting performance that has been affected by the lack of sports events was partially compensated by the launch of online virtuals. We also recently added some new features such as Joker subscriptions, which enables the player to participate in future growth and pay as he grows.",
         "On the operational front, we are implementing additional actions so as to further enhance this important line of business, which has been gaining market share on the back of COVID-related conditions. In specific, we implement the digital on-boarding thus reducing material-related costs. We introduced robotic process automation in our daily operations, positively impacting performance and customer experience and are constantly improving our VIP customers handling.",
         "When it comes to Stoiximan, the Company recorded material top line growth in the first half of the year, with Greek and Cyprus business growing, international operations gaining ground in the mix. Product wise, the Company has been successful into replenishing sports betting losses with casino, and we have every reason to believe that 2020 will be another successful year.",
         "Just before concluding our opening statement, our COVID-related approach with regards to our people has been one of abundance caution and at the same time enactment of best practices regarding proxy protection and contribution to the society.",
         "Our CSR program is continuing on every front, with the speed of response and collective responsibility being impressive. On top, the reopening of our OPAP stores and play stores as well as indirect channels has been successful through our partners' hard work and collaboration, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank them both for their professionalism and commitment.",
         "Together with the invaluable support of our employees, we managed to successfully resume our business in the best possible way, and I am confident that we will be able to stay on the same path.",
         "With that, I'm now concluding my opening statement. Thank you for your patience and attention, and I'm opening the floor for any questions you might have."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. I\u2019m Gaily, your Chorus Call operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the OPAP Conference Call to present and discuss the OPAP S.A.\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]",
         "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jan Karas, Acting CEO of OPAP S.A. Mr. Karas, please proceed."
      ],
      "Pavel Mucha": [
         "Thank you, Jan, and good afternoon to everybody. Like it was the face with the first quarter, the second quarter of 2020 was again split into two completely different periods for both OPAP and most businesses in Greece. After previous closure, OPAP stores opened again on 11th of May and gaming halls opened on 8th of June. As a result, our year-on-year figures demonstrated a material drop; however, the recovery path post-reopening was according to our expectations.",
         "Before going through the details, let me as always refer to macro projections. It is obvious that all macro KPIs have plunged during the lockdown with GDP declining by 15.2% in Q2, and final consumption down by as much as 10.1% in the same period. The outlook remains weak especially since tourism which accounts for a material part of the GDP is hardly hit.",
         "On the positive side, the government's relief measures are still providing some sort of support to several sectors and individuals, while the EU fiscal stimulus should also help towards the end of this year. Overall, GDP estimates for the year still come with a wide range with consensus figures pointing to a sharp drop of minus 0.2%",
         "Going now to OPAP's performance on Slide 8, total Q2 GGR declined by 53.2%, but clearly this metrics is heavily burdened by the lockdown period because between June 8th and June 30th all of our segments have gradually recovered with some of those mainly online and VLTs standing above flat sales levels.",
         "In more detail, most of it dropped by a nominal 45% in Q2 with post-lockdown GGR recovering, but still remaining negative between 8th of June and 30th of June. KINO has been gained that was burdened the most as the game structured and successes minute draws usually require more active time within the shop.",
         "When it comes to JOKER, the addition of a third draw continues to contribute to the games appeal, providing with mild increase on average of the weekly sales. Betting-wise revenues declined by 65%; however, the risk part of major leagues led to a much improved revenue from June onwards, and Jan will refer to that in more detail later on.",
         "VLTs recovered quite strongly also due to the fact that the return to normalize post-lockdown was more established at the time of gaming loss reopened in June versus when OPAP stores opened in May. Overall, activity has been satisfactory, leading to a positive double-digit delta between 8th of June and 30th of June versus the same period last year.",
         "When comparing overall trends on Slide 9, you will find our performance versus the average mobility trends in retail and recreation. While we obviously lost almost all of our revenue during the lockdown period, we managed to gradually come very close to the mobility average in the partial reopening period and return positive year-on-year between 8th of June to 30th of June, clearly outperforming mobility trends.",
         "Through different perspective and as seen on Slide 10, pre-lockdown performance stood at plus 2% in the first two months of the year, while the period that includes the lockdown and the partially opening was down by 67%. The full reopening period pertaining linked to the full contribution of OPAP stores and VLTs i.e. from 8th of June till 31st of August was up by 3.1% thus outperforming even the pre-lockdown period, but the fact that August alone was down by 2.1% together with the COVID second wave makes us cautious for the future.",
         "As seen on Slide 11, the material diversification of the regional contribution of revenue demonstrates that even despite our shops reopening certain islands that have gone on tougher local COVID-related restriction measures or experienced lower local fruitful and spending due to subdued tourism related income are indeed underperforming versus the average. As a result, although Mainland Greece has still been generating marginally positive performance, the wide peers performance differs among different regions make up really worry about the upcoming autumn period.",
         "Moving on to profitability and turning to Slide 12. Recurring EBITDA for the quarter reached \u20ac23 million which is down by 74.7% for the year. However, looking at this through a different perspective, it took roughly one month of full operations for OPAP to generate positive operating profitability for the quarter something that we believe represents a substantial achievement and demonstrates operating resilience of our business model.",
         "On our part, we have been able to fulfill our commitments with regards to OpEx savings as our recurring OpEx base was done in the first half of the year. That's delivering on our promises when we look down cane. Going forward, both payroll and marketing costs will normalize in line with the future development of the business.",
         "Below the EBITDA line, we note non-cash impairments of \u20ac11.5 million mostly related to horse races where the Company numbers have been further burdened by the COVID-related implications and as such, our auditors recommended that we should proceed with such a move.",
         "Finally, moving to Slide 14, although impairments and amortization charges led to our net profit line to be negative for the quarter, we still managed to record operational cash flow of \u20ac70 million for the quarter. As a result, our cash balance remained exceptionally strong at \u20ac328 million without net debt to EBITDA ratio shaping at 1.6 times.",
         "Our solid financial position enables us to once more deliver and as that consensus expectations dividend of \u20ac0.30 per share on top of the \u20ac1 dividend, which was delivered earlier in the year and, this led to total \u20ac1.30 distribution within 2020, which is probably the highest yield when looking at both our international peers and also at Greek large cap companies.",
         "Just before sending over to Jan, I would like to end my part with a short reference to Stoiximan, which has now been renamed to Kaizen Gaming, and it's only the success of the Stoiximan and Betano brands. Its profits for the quarter increased year-on-year and in Q2 the profit contribution was \u20ac1.8 million.",
         "So, very strong Q1 together with the shift towards online during the COVID period in Q2 has helped the Company to grow in the first half of 2020. This is yet another reason why we feel happy that we managed to conclude the second part of the acquisition, and we are now holding an effective 69% stake of the Greek and Cypriot business.",
         "We do not stop here and we have agreed, upon authority's approval to increase further our stakes to almost 85% that together with the acquisition of controls upon auditors consent enables to consolidate the Company.",
         "With that, I'm passing things back to Jan."

            "Yes. Hi, there. Hope you all are safe and healthy. A few questions from my side please. Firstly, first one is to current trading, in your presentation, you touched upon a few data point, but maybe if you could elaborate a bit on the latest dynamics. I would be mainly interested in what you've been seeing since the time tightening of social distancing measures for example the mandatory wearing of mask by customers. I think it was sometime around mid-August I believe. Have you noticed any effects which you would be kin to quantify?",
            "Secondly, as you had problems, you put some efforts on curtailing costs in the second quarter, and as you said, this was visible in operating expenses. Could you tell us the extent which you feel there is more room to lower costs in certain categories,[indiscernible] and if yes, which is my deep belief? That was second question.",
            "And lastly, I actually have a question on the big elephant in the room, namely the gaming duty situation. Has there been any discussion with the relevant authorities? And if not, when should we expect development taking into account that the extension period is softened in less than two months? Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "So, starting with the first question about the impact of the measures implemented in August. We have shown you on one of the slides, the trends we have seen in June, July, August, and as you have know noticed that there is an impact in August. In August, I think at the same time rightly interpret and represents how much it is difficult to predict any future, a lot of partially surprisingly developments have been happening on very short notice during August. We have been reacting and it's very difficult to predict what ahead of us and predict any trends under these circumstances.",
            "What I think is important to highlight though is, at the same time, in the last couple of months and I'll illustrate that there is and continues to be a customer interest in our games despite the COVID measures. So we believe that, the same way customers will be using to getting used to the COVID measures across the all recurring industry the same way this will become the new normal for them also for our own space."

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. The second question about the cost going forward, yes, indeed, in Q2 and during the lockdown, we managed to reduce our costs, very significantly. And as I mentioned in my introductory speech, we are now aligning the costs in line with the business development.",
            "So, basically many of the costs are back to the normality because naturally the reopening of our network of both OPAP stores and gaming halls, there are ongoing operating costs, which are required to run our normal day-to-day operations, but we remained extremely cautious about the future development and basically we are ready to come up with extra savings should the situation dramatically change.",
            "So, yes, we are always looking or for ongoing savings, but we need to really invest into our business for the future growth, but invest cautiously. And as soon as the situation -- if the situation was worsen again, we're ready again to come up immediately with some cost savings again, and those are normal running operating costs of the retail network, IP, and of course also the marketing costs."

            "Third question will be answered by me, Kamil Ziegler, Executive Chairman. Hello, Stamatios, related to the new course in game duties, as we have informed you last time that the order on Greek authorities are already informed about existence of this contract, which is valid since the year 2011 and which is consisting of OPAP repayment of the GGR contribution for the period OPAP 2022 or OPAP 2030 in amount \u20ac1.83 billion. And since that moment that we are not -- there is no further updates about any negotiations, and what is quite clear that OPAP is fully ready to implement this contractual agreement during the coming period."

They were actually surprisingly strong in Q2 or I would say, they were back to normal levels looking at your other operating income line. Could you maybe elaborate a bit on what you've been doing there? And what your plans are in the coming months?"

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, in a way, there were because obviously our non-gaming activities still happen mostly in OPAP stores, although part of them, very small part of them happens in the independent retail where still the stocks are open, but OPAP stores are closed so obviously our non-gaming activities were also impacted."

Would you say that this because of lower incomes related to tourism from the residents islands? Or do you believe that there is a direct impact from less tourism also? And secondly, can you update us please on the CEO succession process? And who was done with that? Thank you very much."

So, it's not only here now, it's also about the people being very much more cautious about what's coming later in the year. So, you're pretty much corrected."

So by the end of the year that\u2019s how clear step plan, we would like to acquire additional 16% sole control and being able to fully consolidate Stoiximan; however, we have some regulatory pending there, so it's not entirely in our hands."

And also with this minus two, we could get maybe I understand, islands are impacting it, but is there any more color you can give such as the performance of the different segments of the business, foot traffic and any other color that you can provide? And I guess, is autumn after the summer season goes away, are we going to potentially look at easier comps for the islands? That's one bit. And then on the online side, given the very solid results in Q2, what kind of market share you would say, you have now with your own brand and also Stoiximan? And what's the outlook for that market share once we get the new licenses in place? Thank you."

The tourism was significantly down, but also there is a large number of workforces is coming from the Mainland Greece because there are lots of seasonal jobs in hotels, restaurants, cafes, and many of them have been shut down during the whole summer. So also people from mainland didn't have normal seasonal income.",

Stoiximan positioned that\u2019s what we can see. Stoiximan is market leader. Now, it's very hard to estimate to provide some more correct definition about market share of Stoiximan because what seems to be a little bit redundant some of other operators and especially where operators are playing some games with the customer bases. And sometimes, if you can see the official results or somehow published results of the most GGR, it's seems that it's not reflecting fully the reality. But definitely, what we can say about Stoiximan, is that this is undisputable market leader in online in Greece."

And frankly, some of the projects could not be executed due to the lockdown.",

And what's the difference in demographics in terms of the most slightly younger people more willing to come out versus older people? Thanks very much."

In terms of consumer behavior, it's something that we see evolving in time, but as you would expect, we obviously see customers being more concerned about the safety and security. So, they kind of think wise, if they want to walk into the store and spend time in the store. We see a large part of the customers preparing to say on the outside, which thanks to the good weather in Greece is at these moments possible.",
            "We see customers being generally cautious about the safety and security. We generally see a very positive feedback from customers about how OPAP has approached the security and safety and all the measures we have taken. And at the same time, customers are concerned tough about the other customers being responsible and behaving responsible.",
            "And there is something especially for those who are living in Greece, you certainly observe the same trend, every week, this is changing and improving in a good way, the compliance with the measures and people being responsible in their behaviors of wearing masks and behaving responsibly. So, that is evolving, but we obviously do see an impact on customer behaviors and that's something that we are also reflecting in our plans.",
            "Going forward, where we will be trying always to provide customers with a safe environment, and with solutions that will be addressing, this relatively new insights that I'm afraid are here to stay for some time and some of them even for long. So, we need to adjust to this new norm."

And even though, we'll obviously pray and hope for the best for the people in Greece. We are obviously prepared also for some of the best scenarios, the worse case being again some significant lockdowns on the specific geographic area, so hopefully not Greek wide.",
            "So, we'll see how that evolves. Spent per customer is one of the categories where many different evolutions may happen, depending on how the whole economic will be doing, and what people will see in terms of the microeconomic situations and measure supply, difficult to forecast."
