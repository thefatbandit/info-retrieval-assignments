         "Thanks you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we executed a lease amendment to extend a 59,000 square foot office tenant in Raleigh, North Carolina through 2025, we extended a 22,000 square foot industrial tenant in Raleigh through 2021, we extended a 5,000 square foot office tenant in Minneapolis through 2023, executed a lease to expand a tenant by 17,000 square feet in Columbus, Ohio with a lease expiration date of December 2025, extended a 26,000 square foot office in Green Tree Pennsylvania through 2031, and collected 98% of scheduled rental income for the months of April, May and June. ",
         "Subsequent to quarter end, we executed a lease amendment to extend a 42,000 square foot office tenant in Richmond through 2026, sold our 347,000 square foot industrial property in Maple Heights, Ohio for $11.4 million resulting in a net capital gain of $1.2 million and collected 99% of scheduled rental income in July. ",
         "As noted on our first quarter call, our investment strategy is emphasizing an increase in our portfolio of industrial allocation, which we believe will improve our property operating efficiencies, reduce capital expenditure levels, and potentially result in improved valuation over time. ",
         "From January 2019, through June of 2020, our investment volume was $201 million, all of which were industrial properties providing further evidence of this commitment. Our industrial allocation has increased from 33% in January 2019 to 43% today with an objective of achieving a 60% allocation within the next 18 to 24 months. ",
         "During the second quarter, our investment opportunities were limited due to the effects of COVID-19. We didn\u2019t acquire any properties during the quarter. However sales listings have in fact increased in numbers recently and at this time, we have a 153,000 square foot industrial property in the I-70 Corridor of Indianapolis that\u2019s in the due diligence process. ",
         "The total cost is approximately $10.6 million with a 10 year remaining lease term and a GAAP cap rate of 8%. The expected closing date is September 1st. Our asset management team continued to deliver on improving our same-store operations. During the second quarter, the team executed four lease extensions, three office properties and one industrial property totaling approximately 113,000 square feet. ",
         "These extensions required no tenant improvements. The team also expanded our anchored tenant by 17,000 square feet in a Columbus Ohio office property and they now occupy the entire building reconfirming the objective of our anchored multi-tenant program. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, our 42,000 square foot office tenant in Richmond Virginia extended their lease through 2026 with no tenant improvement requirements. ",
         "In combination, all of these transactions increased the straight-line rent associated with these properties by approximately 14% over the extended lease terms. In reflecting on the first six months of the year, the team completed eight leasing transactions, seven of which were office properties totaling 362,000 square feet with a weighted average lease term of 6.6 years. ",
         "The weighted average straight-line rent increased by 5% and the overall tenant improvement allowance was approximately $6 per square foot, which in our opinion is a very favorable number with the larger percentage office versus industrial transactions that were completed. ",
         "The onset of the COVID-19 virus has required increased emphasis on portfolio management. The company has successfully implemented a work from home arrangement for our employees. However, our active tenant engagement program continues and is delivering positive results. ",
         "With an emphasis on tenant credit, we have always engaged our tenants quarterly to discuss their recent financial performance and this strategy has established strong ties with each of them. During this pandemic, we have appropriately increased our connections with our tenants. ",
         "Some interesting and favorable characteristics of our tenant profile were included in our business update press releases, 84% of tenant revenue is from tenants who on average contribute 1% or less of company revenue. In the hospitality, oil and gas and airline industries only comprise 2.5% of annual revenue. ",
         "The challenges arising as a result of the virus prompted us to immediately connect with all of our tenants at the onset which we have completed and we\u2019ll continue to do. There has been and we expect there will be requests from tenants for rent deferral and we will address them as we are notified by the respective tenant. ",
         "Our strategy is to offer rent deferral, not rent abatement, to limit the deferral to a one to three month period if at all possible, to have tenants continue to pay a portion of their rent during the deferral period and to require repayment of the deferred rent over a six to twelve month period. There is no doubt that each agreement will have unique business terms. ",
         "However, the key objectives are to maintain our increased core FFO per share and to return cash flow to the proper previous level as soon as possible. The company granted rent deferrals to three tenants in April representing approximately 2% of total monthly rental income throughout the second quarter. ",
         "These tenants continued to pay partial rent. The deferrals ranged from 1.5 months to 3 months and the payback period ranges from 6 months to 9 months currently scheduled to end in March 2021. ",
         "We expect to continue to have conversations with other tenants requesting short-term concessions and we will report the results of those conversations as they take place. And a number of our tenants are taking advantage of the federal programs available to them and we are hopeful of positive outcomes on their applications. ",
         "Anticipating that many on the call are interested in lease expirations through 2020 and beyond, I wanted to summarize the teams\u2019 thoughts and our current activities. We have one lease expiring between now and year-end that has not been negotiated, that lease is with GM and as I indicated in our first quarter call, they will vacate our Austin, Texas property at the end of August. ",
         "Our active marketing of the property with assistance from the local Chamber of Commerce has resulted in eleven current prospects for the building ranging from 65,000 square feet to 320,000 square feet, which of course is the entire building. ",
         "It continues to be interesting to note and report that our GAAP rent at the property of $14.50 per square foot triple net compares favorably in the sub-market with current space offerings in the low to mid-$20 per square foot on a triple net basis. ",
         "Unfortunately, COVID-19 has nearly eliminated property tours in Austin unless they are virtual. We have in fact, created a virtual tour for our property and are using it through our connection with the chamber and with our brokers\u2019 prospects. ",
         "With considerable interest from the West Coast and Chicago, as well as that large Austin prospect, and Tesla\u2019s recent decision to build a gigafactory there, we expect a positive outcome, but must remain patient and persistent with the ongoing virus impacts. ",
         "Long-term, we are positive about our same-store performance as lease expirations for 2021 and 2022 average approximately 5% based on projected rental income. Therefore, overall cash flow should be stable with limited risk enabling the team to focus on growth. ",
         "Market conditions are worthy of comment, particularly with the adverse effects from the onset of the COVID-19 virus. Economic forecasters are estimating that both second and third quarter GDP maybe negative, and of course their estimates do vary. ",
         "This slowdown in economic activity will certainly impact our industry and has had a dampening effect on investment sales volume as April and May and I believe June volumes were down compared to 2019. And port authorities reported drops in container volume ranging from 10% to 30%, compared to the same periods last year. ",
         "However, the continued interest in industrial properties, particularly those related to e-commerce has resulted in no increase in cap rates for this product type in several markets. There is however, some expansion of cap rates for smaller properties that are more manufacturing in nature and particularly for sale leaseback transactions in select markets and the sizes here are anywhere from 50,000 to 200,000 square feet. ",
         "And this is a product type that matches our interest in our underwriting strength, particularly for middle market non-rated companies seeking capital to reinvest in their business. We will continue to monitor the evolving conditions and adjust our strategy accordingly. And as it relates to growth opportunities, investment sales listing have moderated driven primarily by the effect of the virus. ",
         "Our current pipeline of acquisition candidates is approximately $255 million in volume representing 16 properties, all of which are industrial. Of the 16 properties, one property is in due diligence, two are in the letter of intent stage and the balance are under initial review. ",
         "Because of the stay-at-home directives in many states, several of the properties in the pipeline are what I would call, a home position. Our team is staying actively engaged however in these markets as we believe acquisition opportunities will arise that we can and we will pursue. ",
         "So in summary, our second quarter activities reflected strong leasing and rental collection success, continued active engagement to identify industrial acquisition opportunities and collectively positions us well to pursue growth opportunities. ",
         "Now let\u2019s turn over to my partner Mike for a report on the financial results, including our capital markets activities. "

      "David Gladstone": [
         "Well, thank you, Sarah. That\u2019s a nice introduction and thank you all for calling in. It\u2019s an interesting time to talk about real estate, but we still enjoy these times we have with you on the phone and wish we have more time to talk with you and certainly enjoy the questions and at the end. ",
         "Now we\u2019ll hear from Michael LiCalsi, our General Counsel and Secretary. He will give us legal and regulatory matters concerning the call and the report that we\u2019ve given in yesterday. Michael?",
         "Okay. Thank you, Mike. It was a good one and Bob Cutlip did a good job, so did Michael. I think the team has performed very well and we are hurt a little bit by the virus and the government\u2019s reaction. The real problem today is, we have no idea how either part of the U.S. government or the local governments will react to the virus. So there is just a big unknown out there.",
         "We\u2019ve heard a lot today about the numbers of new transactions and leases and all that\u2019s impressive. We\u2019ve collected rents that were due during the first and second quarters that we are in good shape there. ",
         "We\u2019ve executed lease extensions strong there. We got rid of one building we owned in Maple Heights, Ohio. We may sell a few more during the next quarter, but our goal is to keep ourselves above all of the problems that are going on here. ",
         "The team is strong. We have good professional team and pursuing quality properties and a list of acquisitions. But most of these we are looking at the strong credit tenants. They are great tenants and excellent investments that you can get somebody with some financial strength and not in a part of the economy that\u2019s going to collapse. ",
         "The middle market businesses like the many tenants were in is a place that almost all of us hear it was truly has been at it for his whole career of financing and working with middle market tenants. We are not up in the status fear of the big tenants. We\u2019ve got a few of those, but most of them are middle market companies that we underwrite as if we were making a loan to them from a bank. These are times that have never been seen before. We are in the middle of a pretty strong recession at this point in time. But we are doing a fantastic job, I think. ",
         "And I am going to stop here and let people that are smarter than I am ask some questions and we will do the best we can to answer them. Operator, if you will come on please and let\u2019s get some questions from those smart people out there. "

Today's report may include forward-looking statements under the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934 including those regarding our future performance. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that are based on our current plans which we believe to be reasonable.",
         "Many factors may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including all risk factors listed in our Forms 10-Q, 10-K, and other documents that we file with the SEC. You can find these on our website which is gladstonecommercial.com or on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.",
         "The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except as required by law.",
         "And today, we will discuss FFO, which is Funds From Operations. FFO is a non-GAAP accounting term defined as net income, excluding the gains or losses from the sale of real estate and any impairment losses on property, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets.",
         "We'll also discuss FFO as adjusted for comparability and core FFO, which are generally FFO adjusted for certain other non-recurring revenue and expenses. We believe these metrics are a better indication of our operating results and allow better comparability of our period-over-period performance.",

      "Mike Sodo ": [
         "Thanks, Bob and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start by reviewing our operating results for the second quarter of 2020, all per share numbers I reference are based on fully diluted weighted average common shares. FFO and core FFO available to common stockholders were $0.40 and $0.41 per share for the quarter respectively. Specifically, core FFO was $0.40.5 per share rounding up to $0.41. ",
         "FFO and core FFO available to common stockholders were both $0.80 per share for the first six months of the year. This performance demonstrates the accretive, yet prudent growth that the company has completed in recent years, as well as the performance of the in-place portfolio. In addition to these accretive deals, our same-store cash rent continues to grow at 2% on an annualized basis. ",
         "Our second quarter results reflected stable, total operating revenues of $33.5 million as compared to total operating expenses of $24.1 million for the period excluding one property impairment charge. As Bob laid out, our team is actively engaged with every tenant of ours as we intend to maximize shareholder value through and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. ",
         "We are pleased with the team\u2019s and portfolio\u2019s performance through July and believe we\u2019ve performed exceptionally, but these are unchartered times which we will continue to navigate together. We continue to enhance our strong balance sheet as we grow our assets and focus on decreasing our leverage. ",
         "We\u2019ve reduced our debt-to-gross assets by nearly 15% to 46.5% over the past five years through refinancing maturing debt and financing new acquisitions at lower leverage levels. We believe that we are 1% to 2% away from our target leverage level long-term, which means that nearly all raised equity will go toward accretive acquisitions. ",
         "We continue to primarily use long-term mortgage debt to make acquisitions as we grow through disciplined investments while also look to expand our unsecured property pool with additional high-quality assets. Over time, we expect that this will increase our financing alternatives. ",
         "Looking at our debt profile, as of today, our 2020 and 2021 loan maturities are very manageable with only $3 million and $21 million coming due respectively. We have continued to proactively manage and improve our liquidity and maturity profile over time. We continue to minimize our exposure to rising interest rates with over 90% of our existing debt being fixed rate or hedged to fix through interest rate swaps and caps. ",
         "While entering the second quarter with sufficient liquidity we\u2019ve been modestly active in issuing our common stock and preferred Series E stock utilizing our ATM programs. During the second quarter, net of issuance costs we opportunistically raised $500,000 through common stock sales and $1.9 million through preferred stock sales. ",
         "We continue to manage liquidity and the balance sheet to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for upcoming capital requirements. As of today, we have $3 million in cash and $36 million of availability under our line of credit. ",
         "With the current availability, the strong performance of the portfolio and access to our ATM programs, we believe that we have significant incremental flexibility to fund our current operations near long-term properties that we are underwriting in known upcoming improvements at our properties. ",
         "We encourage you to also review our quarterly financial supplement posted on our website, which provides more detailed financial and portfolio information for the quarter. We feel good about continuing to execute our business plan as we continue to manage our existing portfolio, increase our high-quality asset base and continue to improve our metrics. We\u2019re focused on maintaining our high occupancy with strong credit and real estate.",
         "Institutional ownership of our stock has increased over time to 60% as of June 30, nearly a 20% increase over the past four years. Bob and I continue to be very active in meeting with current and potential investors, portfolio managers, coverage analysts, investment banks and alike. We look forward to establishing new relationships as the company moves forward to its next chapter.",
         "Regarding the common stock dividend, we did increase it in the first quarter and while the increase was small, we have also announced that we are leaving the dividend as is again in the third quarter. We have not cut nor suspended the dividend since our IPO in 2003. ",
         "Our stock closed on Monday at $18.54. The distribution yield on our stock is about 8.1%. Many REITs are trading at much lower dividend yields and higher multiples.",
         "Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to David."

It\u2019s not in a high, let\u2019s say transaction velocity location and the configuration is a bit irregular, Gaurav. ",
            "And so, we felt the best thing for us to do since we did not want to expand our portfolio in this part of Ohio was to exit that property and use those proceeds to really reinvest in industrial, but in the markets that we have been targeting recently. ",
            "And fortunately, we came out of this with a capital gain and if I am looking at it going forward, we are looking at a few properties that are, what I call, single storey, non-core office properties that over time we have wanted to believe to move out of anyhow and we are getting the opportunity to do so. ",
            "I do not see any other industrial properties short-term that would be on the disposition list, but we will selectively continue to look at these non-core single property markets, particularly single storey office that we can exit and redeploy the proceeds. ",
            "Mike and I really believe when we\u2019ve said it a number of times they are trying to exit properties, but try to stay under, let\u2019s say $15 million to $20 million a year in our exiting of our product and then redeploy that capital as opportunistically as we can as our teams identify new industrial properties primarily.

So, if in fact the rents are in the $18 to let\u2019s say $20 to $22 range, I anticipate that our TI will be somewhere between, close to around $25. ",

But then the rents are going to be in the mid to upper $20 per square foot. That\u2019s what we are looking at right now. That\u2019s the guidance we\u2019ve received from our brokers and kind of from the chamber and development authority as to what people are seeking. ",

            "I mean, how extensive is that work that you are going to need to do in parts of the building. Is it a situation we are not fully ready to occupy until sometime mid first quarter of 2021 or you are going to be able to be \u2013 able to start occupancy by year-end of this year if you get a tenant in there?

GM did a great job of creating really designing and constructing creative office space in that building having walked it, I mean that building has raised floor, has ten foot ceilings, it has, it\u2019s really column free. When you look at it and having, actually having walked it after it was completed right after 2000s with Dell. ",
            "Michael Dell\u2019s team allowed us to walk through that building as we were developing similar properties in the research triangle. You have two 40,000 square foot floor plates. You enter the building and immediately you have access to elevators, but each of the wings that are $40,000 square feet have their own private elevator. They have their own service elevator. ",

And the refresh for everyone in terms of where our equity desires have been over the last 24 months since July 1st of 2018, we\u2019ve done something in the neighborhood of $150 million of common issuances via overnight, but predominantly through ATM, as well. ",
            "On the preferred side, net of redemptions, we\u2019ve only done $20 million. But Rob, to your point, and obviously demonstrated during the second quarter with us only doing $500,000 on the common side and doing $1.9 million on the prep side, and the common by the way was done at $19.71 and the prep was done at an average share price of $22.52 as compared to its par value of $25. ",
            "But in this exceptional time period with the pandemic, I mean, we are sensitive to the div yield and issuing the preferred at a weighted at a $22.52 implies doing that at a $7.35 dividend yield as compared to our current common dividend yield of $8.1, and it would be as if we issued common at $20.40. So, the long ones here is, we continue to heavily overweight toward common. ",
            "But we need to get more stability, because we don\u2019t love the share price where it is. So, we will contemplate tapping minorly into the prep, but from an aggregate prep load as compared to enterprise value, we are probably in the 11% to 12% range, And Rob, as you know, and we\u2019ve consistently messaged and demonstrated there isn\u2019t a massive appetite to overweight on prep even if perpetual in nature. ",
            "So, I think with our existing liquidity, not being able to predict share prices. But having access to those ATM programs, as well as some modest dispositions, speaking freely, I am going to get caught shot.

So, trying to figure out who has got the upper hand is always going to be difficult. I look at this as a different way. ",

You are not making any money or you can buy a stock like ours and I just think for people who are trying to avoid the big problems out there in the COVID marketplace today. ",

As everybody knows, we are very focused on making the dividend payment and that\u2019s our \u2013 almost our sole reason for living every day. And so, I don\u2019t think that the Board or I or any of the team members want to convert this into something else. ",
            "I think we are right on where we are today and we are just going to keep going, but going slower and more deliberate, and yes, we will sell some buildings. But it\u2019s not to meet the dividend, it\u2019s because it\u2019s out there in a space that we don\u2019t want. One of the big problems of selling something is we\u2019ve got a lot of good buildings that were not favorable toward in terms of long-term. ",
            "But you hate to sell them because they are paying as agreed and so, it\u2019s really hard to say to somebody, I want to get out of this one because they are paying and then you got to go find something, a place to put the money. So, there is a balance that we are looking for here and my goal is for this company, just to continue to hold on tight. ",
            "My own belief is that there will be something that will turn the corner on this COVID-19. I am personally a believer in hydroxychloroquine has one of the ways to stop this thing. But I know that\u2019s against most everybody that\u2019s out there on the government medical profession. But I\u2019ve just seen it in action. I have two doctors, one loves it and gives the long story and the other one doesn\u2019t like it. ",
            "And so, I don\u2019t know whether this is a political matter or whether this is just something that is ingrained in people\u2019s mind is that, hydroxychloroquine doesn\u2019t work. And then the other side says, but we\u2019ve got thousands and thousands of people on hydroxychloroquine for other than this and there is no setback. ",
            "So, somewhere along here, the \u2013 I don\u2019t know, clouds will open and the sunshine will come through and I know the American medical profession is really strong on finding solutions to these kind of problems though. ",
            "I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s answering into your questions, but that\u2019s where we are today. And the goal is not to change what we are doing but to do more of the things that we are doing at just a slower more methodical pace. "

We now are down to the final strokes for another 10,000 square feet there and that is a suburban office property and we competed, believe or not with a CBD property. ",
