         "Thank you, Jacek. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining CSI Compressco\u2019s second quarter 2020 conference call. I\u2019ll give a recap of our second quarter performance and an update on the market environment and then turn it over to Elijio to provide information on the balance sheet, cash flow and liquidity.",
         "First, I\u2019d like to start out by recognizing the exceptional dedication and performance from our management team and all employees for a job well done in one of the most challenging quarters our industry has ever seen due to COVID-19. To maintain adjusted EBITDA nearly flat with the first quarter in an environment dealing with the health and safety of our workforce, our two largest customers and multiple others shutting in production, and overall customer activity declines at a record face is very good execution in the face of extraordinary circumstances. Our executive team is meeting constantly to assess, reassess and proactively respond to the changes we\u2019re seeing with the market and the COVID-19 pandemic in each of our geographic areas where we operate.",
         "We\u2019re pleased that a few employees that have been directly impacted by the virus have recovered or are recovering well, and then we have not had any situations where we could not service or deliver on our customer\u2019s requirements. The Board and I are very proud of what our management team and employees are accomplishing in this environment.",
         "Moving on to our results. As I mentioned, one of the highlights for the quarter is delivering EBITDA of $27 million, which is nearly flat with the $27.8 million we generated in the first quarter, but with a macro backdrop of historical activity reductions in the U.S. land markets. Unlike prior downturns, where the impact to the compression business lagged drilling and completion services, we saw an immediate impact from our customers\u2019 request for price concessions, returning units and shifting units from operating to standby. In turn, we took immediate actions across all fronts and acted quickly and decisively on what we can control. We reduced costs through staff reductions, furloughs and adjustments to salaries and benefits while also reducing third-party costs and negotiating concessions from our suppliers. In doing so, we\u2019ve managed to significantly reduce our overall fixed cost structure, something we will benefit from not only now, but as the market recovers. We made the decision to close our fabrication operations and took out significant overhead at the corporate level.",
         "As we went through the quarter from the start to the end of June, we saw increased levels of stabilization in our cost reductions taking effect. For the full quarter, despite declines in activity from lower utilization and from price concessions, Compression services gross margin actually improved sequentially by 300 basis points. Aftermarket services business gross margins also improved by 500 basis points. And our normalized cash SG&A expenses were reduced by 10%.",
         "As anticipated and discussed on our Q1 earnings call, our compression services revenue and gross profit decreased sequentially but compressing services margins improved from 51.9% in the first quarter to 54.9% in the second quarter, a significant accomplishment given the declining revenue base. These are the highest compression services margins in CSI Compressco\u2019s history. Compression services fuel costs were reduced by 20% while revenue decreased 14%. Some of the cost savings also came from the lack of startup costs associated with redeploying compression units. Aftermarket services revenue declined from the first quarter by 12%, but gross profit increased by 33%. The drop in revenue was due to weakened customer demand as they deferred maintenance spending and non-replenishment of part inventories. Gross profit increased due to a combination of cost reductions and change in product mix.",
         "Equipment sales revenue increased by 2.5 times from the first quarter, which drove a consolidated sequential revenue increase of 7%. We completed a significant amount of new equipment deliveries mainly into Latin America. We previously announced our plans to shut down our fabrication operations, given the lack of backlog, and also indicated our intentions to sell the building and real estate.",
         "In early July, we completed the sale of the Midland Texas fabrication facility for gross proceeds of $17 million. These fund were received in early July. Our backlog of $8 million will be delivered in the third quarter, after which we will exit the new equipment sales business.",
         "As we move into the third quarter, the macro environment remains uncertain due to continued concerns of COVID-19 and the impact and uncertainty around oil and gas supply and demand dynamics. During these continued difficult times, our strategy is to stay aligned with our core customers, keep as many of our dedicated and talented employees as we can, employ creative standby solutions to minimize equipment releases, increase unit concentration to reduce costs and continue to migrate to customers with strong balance sheets.",
         "During the quarter, our fleet on standby reached a peak of 20%, but as oil prices stabilized and began to improve during the latter part of the quarter, many operators started to bring production back on line and we finished the quarter at 15% of our horsepower one standby. As we start the month of August, that will come down by meaningful amount as one of our top customers began bringing wells back into production. We believe our utilization low point will now be better than the previous downturn. This is a more optimistic view than we had in our first quarter earnings call, given the more stable view of the market than where we were this time last quarter, but clearly much market uncertainty remains. We\u2019re seeing that our compression services pricing concessions have stabilized in the mid to high single digits. We expect our after services market business is going to be under some pressure for the rest of the year, as it\u2019s dependent on equipment maintenance and replenishing parts for our customers, items that customers often delay during downturns.",
         "So overall, I want to, again, commend our management team and employees on the strong second quarter and navigating through these tough times. We still expect a difficult market environment in the second half of the year, but the fundamentals of our business will be intact for many years to come. In the immediate and foreseeable future, we\u2019re focused on the things we can control, such as costs, safety and the service quality as we navigate the partner through this downturn, successfully and responsibly. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Elijio."
      ],
      "Elijio Serrano": [
         "Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everybody.",
         "I\u2019d like to spend a couple of minutes on the non-recurring charges we incurred, cash flow, on the balance sheet and on our capital structure before we open up the call to questions. In the second quarter, we incurred $15.8 million of non-recurring charges of which $9 million are related to the write-off of vital compression ets and related field inventory, which are non-cash charges. $4.8 million are related to transactions, accounting and legal fees associated with the recently completed bond exchange and $2.1 million are related to other costs, mainly severance and costs associated with rightsizing the organization. During the second quarter, we generated $4.8 million of cash from operating activities. In the first half of the year, we have generated $18 million of cash from operating activities.",
         "Free cash flow for the first half of the year is $10.6 million. We ended the second quarter with $6.8 million of cash, up from $2.4 million at the beginning of this year and the outstanding balance on the ABL revolver was only $1.5 million [ph] at the end of the second quarter.",
         "We were able to reduce maintenance capital expenditures by almost 40% in the second quarter versus the first quarter, in response to the slowdown in business activity levels. Distributable cash flow was $8.4 million in the second quarter. In the first half of the year, distributable cash flow is $17.1 million, which annualizes to $34 million or approximately $0.71 per unit. This compares to a unit price at the close of business on Friday of $0.95. This is not a bad DCF yield. For the full year, we expect growth capital expenditures to be between $4 million and $8 million; we expect maintenance capital expenditures to be between $20 million and $22 million; and we expect to invest in automation, and remote monitoring systems and technology that we believe create competitive advantages and will result in fuel cost savings. In the upcoming investor meetings and the earnings calls, we will highlight and spend more time on these investments and how they are generating returns for us. This year, we expect to spend $3 million to $5 million in this area.",
         "On June 11th, we announced a successful exchange of unsecured bonds for secured bonds. $215 million of our unsecured bonds with an August 2022 maturity were exchanged for secured first lien, and second lien bonds with respective maturity dates of 2025 and 2026. As part of the process, we eliminated $9 million of debt. We were able to successfully extend maturities or eliminate $215 million of the August 2022 unsecured bonds. Our maturities are now $81 million with a coupon at 7.25% due August 2022 and all of the other bonds are due in 2025 and 2026.",
         "As part of this transaction, we\u2019re able to markedly use cash interest expense with a pick option on the $155 million of the second lien debt. After this exchange and given the market conditions, our mandatory cash outflows on an annualized basis are approximately $75 million, including $48 million of interest expense, approximately $20 million of maintenance capital expenditures and approximately $5 million of cash taxes and lease payments. This compares to our second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $27 million. We are comfortable that we are nicely prepared to manage through this downturn and the reduction is spending by the industry.",
         "Our strategy to address the $81 million of August maturities is to accumulate $10 million to $25 million of cash between now and August of next year to repay a portion of the $81 million in cash and to refinance the balance. We believe that given our financial performance and the actions we are taking to manage costs and to create liquidity, we will find partners for this refinancing.",
         "Talking about liquidity, in the second quarter, we initiated a series of actions to monetize assets that we felt were not giving us the appropriate returns and the predictability of earnings that we are looking for. In July, we sold and collected for $17 million in gross proceeds the sale of our Midland fabrication real estate and buildings, transaction costs were only around $300,000.",
         "In early July, we received $2.6 million in proceeds for the sale of non-core midsized assets that were idled and unlikely to go back to service. In addition, last week we received a purchase order to sell $6.7 million of large idled horsepower units to one of our significant customers. We expect to provide aftermarket services to this customer on the assets that they will be buying from us. We expect this sale to be completed and the proceeds to be received by the end of the third quarter. The sum total of these items is $26 million of cash proceeds that will be used to fund our maintenance growth and technology CapEx and therefore free up cash flow from operations to improve our liquidity.",
         "We will continue to evaluate all the assets in our fleet. And those assets that might not generate the returns and the persistency of earnings that we\u2019re looking for will be targets for monetization to create additional liquidity, especially those assets are unlikely to be put back in service in the near future.",
         "CSI Compressco has a $35 million asset base revolver with a term borrowing base of approximately $21 million before outstanding letters of credit. $1.5 million was drawn on the revolver at the end of the second quarter. The revolver matures June 2023, and is secured with field inventory and receivables. We do not expect to have any amounts drawn on the ABL in the near future.",
         "CSI Compressco\u2019s net leverage was 5.1 times at the end of the second quarter, down from a high of 7 times at the end of Q2 2018. And as a reminder and very important, none of the outstanding bonds contained any maintenance covenants. Overall, we had a solid second quarter, completed a bond exchange to push out a significant amount of our maturities and are in the process of creating incremental liquidity to shore up the balance sheet. We like where we are, given the market environment.",
         "Nick, with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions."

So, I guess, you mentioned the pricing concessions have really shallowed or stopped coming down. So, I guess, can you help us think through how much of that was already reflected in the 2Q P&L and then how much is still to come in the 3Q?"

         "Remarks": [
            "So, Praveen, and I think the key item is that we started working with our customers at the back end of the first quarter, and then began putting those concessions in place in April, and they gradually took hold through the quarter. So, we have not seen the full three-month impact of those concessions. So, while all they bottomed out, we think that the third quarter we\u2019ll see the full impact of three months of those concessions, because the second quarter reflected those gradually coming into the system."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And I guess from the standpoint of the cost side of that, obviously cost came down tremendously. Can you help us understand how much of that was because of units on standby and how we should expect the cost per horsepower to trends into 3Q?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Praveen Narra"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So, cost came down through a combination of efforts. I think, our management team did an exceptional job. And as soon as they saw customers start to pull back equipment, concessions for price increases started to come in, they started shutting down everything. We implemented temporary salary reductions. We aggressively managed over time. We suspended, for example, any 401(k) contributions on the employer side, not knowing how difficult this was going to be. So, a lot of it was led by management initiatives that are completely within our control. Now, in some cases where equipment got returned, we don\u2019t need those resources to go out and perform maintenance on the equipment that\u2019s either on standby or has been returned to us. So, eliminates costs, that eliminates over time that eliminates salary, but also more importantly that eliminates lube and oil, and components costs. So, all that -- I think the sum total of all that benefited us during the quarter. Same way, some of those initiatives gained traction immediately in the early parts of April, because we were very aggressive in taking care of it. Others scaled down as equipment started getting returned. So, I think that we\u2019ll see the current run rate of expenses stay consistent into the second quarter -- into the third quarter, I mean."

So, take that into account as you model."

You mentioned that it\u2019s going to be better than in the 2016 downturn. Can you help us understand, whether it\u2019ll be fully reflected?

And again, that\u2019s based on what our current -- our customers are currently telling us. But, as we have seen in the last three months, their information direction is changing very-rapidly, but current information tells us, it\u2019ll bottom out in the August-September time period."

Obviously, it remains part of the denominator. If a customer puts equipment on standby and we continue to bill them some amount, it\u2019s part of both, the numerator and the denominator."

So, I know you said, you\u2019re going to use the $26 million towards maintenance CapEx, but at the end of the day, cash is just fungible. Is it, the question -- I guess, one way to put it, as you look at growth CapEx over the next 12 months, I know you add certain projects sort of in the pipeline already this year. As you think about growth CapEx, projects versus possibly repaying -- buy back bonds in the open market. We\u2019d love to get your thought process, how you\u2019re thinking but that equation?"

Any growth CapEx will be only for our critical customers, will be directed at existing networks where we\u2019ve got clusters of equipment, and obviously, if we don\u2019t have those specific assets that they are looking for. Otherwise, I think that we looked for existing fleet to keep redirecting assets to contemplate them through our core customers, unlikely that we will use growth CapEx to pursue opportunities. It will be growth CapEx only for our existing customer base and those that are core customers. And obviously, with the strong balance sheet, and we like the customer base and the concentration that we have, we like the balance sheet of our customers, we feel we\u2019re in good shape there."

But just wondering, in terms of looking at how much of that cost reduction is permanent, and how much sort of increase again when business starts picking up?"

            "So, Sharon, when equipment is being deployed, we incur startup cost. And clearly, there was almost no startup costs being incurred in the second quarter. And I think that you\u2019ll see that very comparable to what our publicly traded peers also report. We do have temporary salary reductions in place. We have 401(k) that we\u2019re not matching on the company side, but the management team has also made structural changes. ",
            "We think that when the market rebounds and we\u2019ve got confidence that there\u2019s a path forward that is predictable, some of that cost will come back into the system because we want to keep and maintain our strong employee base. But, some of the changes are structural in nature that should not recur. Now, the other thing that I do want to reference and we\u2019ll talk about it more in the upcoming investor conferences and earnings calls, is that we\u2019ve been investing quite a bit of time and effort and now capital on automation, remote monitoring, and we think those are going to make a big difference. They\u2019ll give us predictability so that we can do maintenance on a predictive basis rather than on a routine basis. And some of those are just now gaining traction that will benefit us and help us long-term in the future. So, some of them are temporary to address a downturn, but some of them are also structural changes. And we\u2019re also in the early phases of getting the benefit of some of the technology that we\u2019re investing."

We mentioned that we sold $2.6 million in early July, and we collected that cash that was primarily for mid-sized equipment that we don\u2019t see that equipment going back to work anywhere in the immediate future. So, I would call those very high returns. Then, on the other equipment, it\u2019s primarily with a key significant customer. They wanted to own the assets that we have available. We\u2019ll put them in the same network that we work with owned fleet, and we\u2019ll provide aftermarket services. So, that was more to accommodate our key customer requests, and actively looking to sell some of the large equipment. We believe that the large equipment, both the 1,380 horsepower and the 2,500 horsepower is a core part of our fleet on a go forward basis. And our preference is to retain that equipment. But, when a key customer sales, we\u2019ll take some of that equipment, put it in network, continue provide services, we will accommodate those customers."

And also recognize that at any point in time, we sell between $1 million and $2 million of equipment, primarily older equipment comes off of a network. Brokers are always asking us if we\u2019re open to selling older equipment. So, on an annual basis, we\u2019ll sell anywhere from $4 million to $8 million of older equipment. I think, that\u2019s probably appropriate to continue to expect that anywhere between 1 and 2 a quarter of older equipment is to continue to be sold.

We started negotiating and working with customers in April and they started coming on line gradually April, then May and then June. We -- and as Brady mentioned, we believe that we received the vast majority of those concessions for price requests. So, we saw them phase in during the second quarter, but we\u2019re going to see the full three-month impact in the third quarter. We do not yet see a clear line of sight to be able to begin to recoup some of those.

            "So, Selman, the standby rates can vary. In some cases, it will be as much as 70% of the original monthly fee; in other cases, it can be below 50%. It\u2019s dependent on whether it gets put on contract when it\u2019s on -- put on standby, if it\u2019s on contract or if it\u2019s on month-to-month. When we put it on standby, obviously, we\u2019re not out there adding lube and oil; we\u2019re not out there replacing valves; we\u2019re not out there doing anything with the panel boxes, and we don\u2019t have personnel driving out to those locations. We basically cease incurring any cost for them. The gross margin that we receive when it\u2019s operating, in some cases matches the gross margin that we have when it\u2019s on standby. So, it really depends on the mix that comes back. If it\u2019s some of the units that are currently on contract with an agreed upon standby rate, the benefit might not be significant. If it\u2019s a month-to-month contract that we put it on standby at rates, say, below 50% as an example, it might be incremental to gross margin and put it back to work."

So, they\u2019re seeing the same thing we are. Some of them are shutting in part of their own fleet that they own. Some of them are pulling units off of production, because the volume of gas is not supported. And when they do both, they don\u2019t require any ongoing either recurring maintenance or upgrades and overhauls that they do. So, we assume that the equipment our customers own goes through the same process that equipment that we own that we service ourselves. If it\u2019s on standby, unlikely for anything to be done on a monthly basis. If it\u2019s pulled off of production of production, they park it until they need it back on line. Then, they\u2019ll call us for startup support. And then, if they need to do an overhaul or a rebuild of the engine and it hits that time cycle, they\u2019ll call us out to do that."
