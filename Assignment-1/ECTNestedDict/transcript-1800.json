         "Thanks Sunny and hello everyone! Third quarter saw an increased effect of the economic downturn due to COVID-19 on our business. From a financial perspective it has changed our business in three key areas. ",
         "First of all, our revenues and gross margin profile changed significantly. Second, it increased pressure on liquidity, so we modified our capital structure to ensure that we have the liquidity needed to weather the downturn for an extended amount of time. Third, the changing business forecast prompted an examination of our assets to ensure they were properly valued. ",
         "For the third quarter revenues were $171 million compared $197 million in the prior year quarter. Medical revenues for the quarter decreased $14 million to $138 million and industrial revenues decreased $12 million to $34 million. For the third quarter our gross margin was 15% compared to 31% in the prior year quarter. ",
         "During the quarter we incurred one-time costs of $16 million for the write-off of inventory associated with discontinued products and $1 million of restructuring charges. Excluding these unusual items and other non-GAAP adjustments, our adjusted or non-GAAP gross margin was 26% compared to 34% in the prior year quarter. ",
         "Still included in the non-GAAP gross margin were some unusual expenses that are not treated as non-GAAP adjustments, namely about $6 million or 4 points of margin from additional inventory reserves, higher freight and tariff costs and property revaluation. The remaining margin decline from the prior year quarter was primarily due to unfavorable product mix and lower overhead absorption with reduced shipments. ",
         "We did see reductions in operating expenses in the third quarter due to actions taken over the past several months. R&D expenses were $19 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $2 million from the prior year quarter. R&D expense remained at about 11% of revenues for the quarter due to the lower revenue base. ",
         "Third quarter SG&A expenses were $31 million, same as the prior year quarter. Both periods included approximately $2 million of expenses related to acquisition integration, restructuring and other non-operational costs. During the quarter we also recorded a $3 million charge for the impairment of some intangibles associated with the acquisition of direct conversion. ",
         "Depreciation and amortization totaled $10 million for the third quarter compared to $9 million in the prior year. The third quarter included $1 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Santa Clara facility. We had an operating loss for the third quarter of $27 million compared to operating income of $5 million in the year ago quarter. ",
         "Our non-GAAP operating loss for the third quarter was $1 million compared to operating income of $19 million in the year ago quarter. ",
         "Interest expense in the third quarter was $7 million, including $1 million of non-cash interest charges associated with the convertible debt issuance, compared to $5 million of interest expense in the year ago quarter. ",
         "Other expenses were $6 million for the third quarter and included $3 million for the impairment of investment in a start-up detector technology, as well as $1 million of expense associated with the valuation of deferred consideration for the acquisition or direct conversion. ",
         "The remaining amount of other expense was due to losses from foreign exchange and unconsolidated joint ventures. We recorded a tax benefit for the third quarter of $12 million compared to tax expense of $1 million in the prior year quarter. We had a net loss of $28 million or $0.73 per diluted share in the third quarter compared to a net loss of $1 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.",
         "The non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $8 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net earnings of $9 million or $0.24 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Diluted shares outstanding were 39 million shares compared to 38.3 million shares in the prior year quarter.",
         "Turning to the balance sheet, accounts receivable decreased by $17 million during the quarter. Collections remained stable with day sales outstanding at 58 days, same as in the prior year quarter. The inventory remained flat in the third quarter at $283 million. Cash flow from operations was $1 million for the third quarter and is $25 million for the fiscal year to-date compared to $49 million for the prior year to-date. ",
         "We ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $87 million, which is an increase of $63 million in the quarter. Correspondingly, total gross debt outstanding increased by $86 million during the quarter to $469 million. The profile of our debt has changed. We now have total bank debt of $269 million, almost entirely on the term loan, plus an undrawn revolving credit facility with $100 million available. ",
         "In addition, in the third quarter we issued $200 million of convertible notes that are due in five years. The net proceeds were used to reduce the bank debt and increase our cash balance. The notes have a 4% interest rate that was paid biannually and are callable after three years. The conversion feature was set at a 25% premium, but we purchased a call spread to effectively raise that to 50%. ",
         "We have strengthened our liquidity position with a higher cash balance and availability under the revolver and will continue to drive programs to improve our cash flow such as cost reduction plans, lower working capital and reduced capital equipment purchases. ",
         "As I head into retirement, I want to say thanks for all the support I've gotten from everyone on the Varex team. Over the past 15 years, I've been very lucky to build bonds with so many wonderful people in this company and I really appreciate their friendship, as well as their commitment to the Varex vision. ",
         "Let me focus on a couple. First of all, I've had an incredible finance team that has worked tirelessly to close each quarter and help me dive into the details of the numbers. Second, thanks to Sunny and the senior leadership for being great partners for the past four years, and then last but certainly not the least, a special thanks to the legal team and to Howard for everything that they have done for me and for Varex. ",
         "I'm excited about the prospects for Varex and I have a lot of confidence in Sunny and Sam\u2019s ability to lead the company through its next phase of growth. ",
         "With that, let me turn the discussion over to Sam for some comments on the outlook. "

      "Howard Goldman": [
         "Good afternoon and welcome to Varex Imaging Corporation\u2019s earnings conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. With me today are Sunny Sanyal, our President and CEO; Sam Maheshwari our new CFO, and Clarence Verhoef, our Retiring CFO.",
         "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter are for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, unless otherwise stated comparisons are to the same quarter of the prior year. ",
         "On today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings press release, which is posted on our website.",
         "Please be advised that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions or projections about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Risks relating to our business are described in our quarterly earnings release and our filings with the SEC. ",
         "Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those anticipated is contained in our SEC filings, including Item 1A-Risk Factors of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion speaks as of today's date, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in this discussion.",
         "And now, I'll turn the call over to Sunny."
      ],
      "Operator": [
         "Greetings! And welcome to the 3Q FY \u201920 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.",
         "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Howard Goldman, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin."
      ],
      "Sam Maheshwari ": [
         "Thanks Clarence. I'm excited to join Varex to help lead the company through its next phase of growth and profitability. As the first order of the job, I'll be working on improving the capital structure, as well as the operating and cost structure of the company. ",
         "In the near term as Clearance noted, liquidity has become a key focus area for us. Based on our current forecast we may not be able to meet some of the financial covenants under our existing credit agreement over the next 12 months. Hence, we are actively working on replacing the current credit facility with new sources of debt financing. More information on this will be included in our notice of late filing of third quarter 10-Q. ",
         "On the operating side, we continue to take steps to lower costs. First, the transfer of the detector production from the Santa Clara facility to Salt Lake City and other sites will be completed by the end of this fiscal year. The net annual benefit from this consolidation is projected to be approximately $15 million. We expect this benefit to start showing on the P&L starting in fiscal 2021 and be fully reflected in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. ",
         "Secondly, a few weeks ago we announced the reduction in force of 94 people. This reduction is expected to result in annual savings of approximately $13 million and will be fully reflected on the P&L from the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and we continue to partner with our suppliers on cost reduction opportunities. All these actions lead to a lower cost structure that will position Varex to have better profitability when the economy recovers from COVID-19. ",
         "Due to the uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, last quarter we withdrew guidance of revenue and EPS for the full fiscal year 2020. While we reevaluate guidance that can be provided on an ongoing basis, for Q4 of fiscal 2020, we expect revenues to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million. ",
         "With that, I would like to hand the call back to Sunny for some closing remarks. "
      ],
      "Sunny Sanyal": [
         "Thank you, Howard. Good afternoon everyone and welcome. Before we begin, it's my pleasure to introduce you to our new CFO, Sam Maheshwari. Same brings to us more than 20 years of experience in finance with private and public high-tech companies and this experience will be instrumental in leading Varex into our next stage of growth. Sam will have some remarks today before we get into the Q&A. ",
         "Also here with us is Clarence Verhoef, who\u2019s been our CFO up to this point. On behalf of everyone at Varex, I want to thank him for his service during the past 15 years and particularly for his leadership during the spin-off of Varex and in getting us established as an independent public company. We wish Clarence all the best in his retirement. ",
         "The COVID-19 pandemic began to impact our business in the second quarter of this year and it began as a shift in mix, largely between our medical and industrial segments along with a bubble of demand in certain areas of medical such as CT Tube and detectors for mobile X-ray. ",
         "As the pandemic progressed, in the third quarter we experienced a further slowdown in sales in our industrial segment, particularly in cargo and airport security. At the same time, we continue to see an increase in sales of CT and radiographic products. These gains were offset by a significant decline in sales of our products used in elective medical procedures such as cardiology, oncology, dental and mammography. ",
         "The net impact in the third quarter was a revenue declined of 13% from a year ago to $171 million. On a segment basis, medical revenues decreased 9% and industrial decreased 25% from the prior year quarter. ",
         "During the third quarter, we continue to see strength in CT and our volume of CT Tubes grew, particularly in sales for new systems, each of which represents a potential for recurring revenues in the future. This growth in CTs came both, from our global OEM customers, as well as from demand in China. ",
         "Despite the turbulence in our medical and industrial markets, we have continued to win new business, driven by our ongoing innovation, the strength of our decade\u2019s long customer relationships and our efficient globally local manufacturing operations. ",
         "Our customers have continued to win in the markets that they sever, and rely on our innovative technologies to provide mission critical components for their systems. In fact one our veterinary customers recently celebrated the sale of their 4,000 system using our detectors. Our customers in China who have been making steady progress with the sales of CT Systems are now experiencing market share gains in their local markets and we look forward to supplying them with a variety of components as their businesses grow. ",
         "In response to the COVID related decline in revenues and gross margins, we examined our product portfolio very closely and we decided to discontinue a number of low margin products in the quarter. The combination of inventory charges for the discontinued products, unfavorable product mix and additional one-time adjustments led to an unusually low gross margin rate for the quarter. ",
         "Over the past five months, we've also been taking actions to reduce expenses. The results of those actions are reflected in our operating expenses for the third quarter, which declined by more than 10% sequentially from the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 and also from the prior year quarter. ",
         "Some of these cost actions such as furloughs, pay reductions and suspension of 401-K were temporary in nature and largely aimed at managing our cash flow. ",
         "In addition to these temporary measures, we also took some headcount reduction actions, which when combined with other actions will result in an overall work force reduction of about 10% this calendar year. The combined impact of these actions is expected to result in cost savings of more than $25 million in fiscal year \u201821. ",
         "Some of these actions have been completed, while the others will be carried out between now and the early part of fiscal year 2021. These cost actions, rationalization of our product portfolio and productivity gains from closing the Santa Clara facility will better position Varex for when the X-ray imaging markets recover from the downturn caused by COVID-19. ",
         "I want to recognize the contributions of employees that were impacted by our work force reduction. These are valued employees and we wish them all the best. We have carefully assessed, reprioritized and redistributed their work, so that we can continue to execute our plans and meet our customer obligations. ",
         "On that note, let me hand over the call to Clarence to talk about our financial performance in the third quarter in greater detail. "
      ],
      "Sunny Sanyal ": [
         "Thank you, Sam. While there are a number of uncertainties facing us, I am confident that once the effect of COVID-19 pandemic passes, the markets that we serve and the demands for our products will bounce back. We are an innovation leader with market leading products and exceptional relationships with our customers, our end markets are resilient, and there is a lifelong given need for healthcare and security products. ",
         "During this economic downturn we have remained focused on our long term strategy and stayed on track with our new product introduction programs. In addition, our facilities are operationally prepared to meet the demand that we expect to see when elective procedure volumes at healthcare facilities around the world and corresponding sales of imaging capital equipment returned to normal. ",
         "Despite the headwinds due to COVID-19, we are confident that not only the fundamentals of our business remain strong, but that our strategies for growth and market leadership are still spot on. As we have discussed previously, the three pillars of our long term growth strategy are; first, to drive growth and market expansion via new product introductions and technology innovation to enable new applications. ",
         "Second, to drive growth in emerging markets by implementing a local for local strategy; and third, to drive growth via expansion into new and greenfield verticals of industrial imaging. We\u2019ve made very good progress on all three fronts this year and the momentum continued in the third quarter. Let me tell you a little bit more about progress made in each of these areas. ",
         "Our customer and market success is enabled by innovation. It is what we are known for and the number one reason why our customers seek us out. Last fiscal year we launched nearly four dozen new or updated x-ray imaging products across our solution lines. ",
         "Continuing with that momentum this year, we've begun shipping early versions of our Z Platform detectors to our medical and dental customers. This platform approaches CMOS like performance cost effectively. Over time we expect our Z Platform to be a disruptive technology which can potentially displace more of silicon as a platform in dynamic detectors.",
         "We are very happy with the enthusiastic early response by OEMs in surgery, cardiovascular and dental markets. Along with the Z Platform is an array of our next generation lightweight, robot radiographic detectors with market leading wireless performance that are ideal for both fixed and mobile applications. We are shipping these detectors in volume now, and in the future we intend to make these detectors available on rugged, non-glass substrate. ",
         "Our innovation in CT technology has continued in both the high end segments of CT, as well as in the high volume 16, 32 and 64 slide segment intended for emerging markets and value segments of mature markets. Since our recent launch, a full array of polymeters [ph] for radiographic and fluoroscopic applications, we have shipped over 5,000 units and are beginning to expand our customer base. We have also continued to make progress with some anchor customers on incorporating our nanotube multimeter sources and photon counting detectors into potential new applications for the future. ",
         "The second leg of our strategy is to establish ourselves as a globally local company with our local for local approach to operations and customer relationships. We are now actively shipping detectors made in Wuxi and we have been shipping tubes assembled in Wuxi for a while now. ",
         "As I mentioned before, our local for local strategy is targeting both, growing relationships with our local OEMs like we have in China, as well as with our global OEM customers who want local content, local commercial and operational support from a partner like us. ",
         "As you\u2019re maybe aware, we've also implemented our local-for-local program in the U.S. and Europe to serve our global OEM customers that have manufacturing facilities in these regions. We are unique in this capability and it is a significant differentiator. ",
         "The third pillar of our strategy is to drive growth into industrial verticals. In Q3 we saw a slowdown in sales for airport and cargo security and in oil and gas, but our market development and product development efforts in these verticals continue to move forward. ",
         "The value proposition for imaging applications is very strong in many industrial verticals and our perspective on this segment as a long term growth opportunity for us has not changed. We are at an important juncture in our evolution, as we transition from Varex 1.0 to Varex 2.0. The first version is where among other things we stood up a new public company following our spin off, completed the integration and consolidation of a major acquisition and expanded our global footprint. ",
         "Varex 2.0 will be about driving growth and improving our financial performance and capital structure. Over the coming quarters, we will provide more information on our vision for Varex 2.0. ",
         "With that, we will now open up the call for your questions. "

            "Absolutely! Yeah, it\u2019s my pleasure. Just a couple on the revenue trends and I realize you guys are a little bit longer cycle, but it does seem like OEMs, at least you are spending some money in some cases. So I'm just trying to separate this. You know some of the mix drop obviously in some of your higher margin markets you know are more related to lots of surgeries and those things do seem to be coming back you know somewhat and again I realize you guys are not directly correlate with day-to-day activity. ",
            "But just trying to figure, any color on are OEMs are starting to spend more now. You mentioned there\u2019s not much visibility and you sort of gave some revenue guidance to that. So I'm just trying to get a little more color on that if you can. "

            "Yeah, Larry, this is Sunny. To give you color on [inaudible] front and by geography. First reminder there, the components [Audio Gap] that go into these imaging equipment that the OEMs making and these are capital equipments. So what triggers the purchase of capital equipment is the availability of capital budget in the health care organizations. ",
            "So in terms of modalities, first of all as we said, CT has continued to stay active and strong through the whole process. We\u2019ve seen this now throughout the year, in fact during the height of the pandemic, in the third quarter, in the second quarter we saw a bubble demanded in CT and then CT has still continued on. So that was our projection if you recall, that CT is a versatile modality and there's a significant demand for CT globally and including the emerging markets, so that has continued on. ",
            "Radiographic saw a bubble in demand. It's \u2013 you know it will settle down to some normal levels, but that was a bubble. ",
            "Where the significant drop off for us has been in oncology, cardiology, dental and mammography. These are what we\u2019ve been calling as elective procedure modalities. There it\u2019s encouraging to see that the volumes \u2013 the procedural volumes are slowly ticking up in hospitals, that's great, and our customers are also making those comments that they are starting to see surgery volumes and cap volumes in dental and they are seeing that up-tick. ",
            "The question is for them is, when does capital equipment purchasing return to what used to be, let\u2019s say in 2019 type of a normal. There the story is by geography. What we're hearing from our customers and it\u2019s probably consistent with what you \u2013 hopefully it's consistent with what your hearing as well, is certain markets like China came back fairly rapidly and China is headed back towards some flavor of normalcy. ",
            "Rest of Asia is a little behind that. Europe is starting on its uptick and people are confident that the markets in Europe are \u2013 now they are starting to see tender activity, quote activity, but there hasn't still yet been major buying activity, and the U.S. is the farthest \u2013 actually U.S. is behind that followed by Latin America, which is the farthest behind. ",
            "For us, for our customers, most of our customers, the U.S. represents the largest market for high-end products, and the rest of the country's emerging markets, while they're coming back, for us it's still you know some amount of the value segment products. So a lot depends on the recovery. The speed of recovery is the part that's unknown. I hope I gave you enough color. So for us - we\u2019ll proceed by geography and by modality. "

         "Remarks": [
            "And any visibility? You mentioned sort of you know obviously the knock on effect. OEMs, will only spend if the hospitals have demand, even with you know hopefully continued improvement in procedures, obviously hospitals will probably remain under pressure until COVID is not really an issue anymore, which unlikely will happen in the next six to 12 months. So is there a possibility where hospitals are financially under a lot of pressure. So budgets remain well below normal for an extended period of time even in a post-COVID world."

However, given that our customers conduct business globally, we think that won\u2019t be a global story. I think global \u2013 there will be a lot of variability in how that plays out globally. ",
            "So the budgets are also not entirely hospital based budgets, right. So mammography there's a lot of outpatient budget, physician offices and dental, most of the dental equipment goes into physician offices. ",
            "So, if we will see a ratcheting up of modality based capital equipment purchasing versus light switch being thrown on. So we are staying very, very close to this and as you know, we\u2019re ahead of the value chain, on the supply chain front. So I'm optimistic that we will see some of these trends perhaps a little bit earlier than you may \u2013 that the actual shipments of equipment. "

The detrimental margin I think sequentially was like 70% or something. So even higher than I thought it would be, because I know Q2 was already somewhat impacted by mix. It sounds like this quarter was probably worst. Just trying to \u2013 if you had the bucket, those two categories, was it more of a mix in that 70% contraction or was overhead or both close to even?"

            "Yeah Larry, if you don\u2019t mind, maybe I'll just go through a little bit of a walk from last year's gross margin of 34% to the 26% non-GAAP gross margin."

      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "[Cross Talk] Okay. So there was \u2013 even though we did some significant adjustments that we treated as non-GAAP there was also some items that were adjustments of one time in nature, but they did not get treated as non-GAAP, and that would have been some additional inventory reserves based on changing volume profile, some revaluation of some assets and that be an expense on the P&L that is not treated as a non-GAAP. ",
            "And then we also had an increase in freight and tariff costs. Somewhat \u2013 you know I mean mostly I'd say the freight is a lot of intercompany movement of freight, because \u2013 and inbound freight, so those costs have gone up recently. The combination of those one time kinds of advance is roughly three points, the gross margin. ",
            "The lower productivity, just and less overhead absorption, and I would put Santa Clara a little bit in the mix of that as well, complicating it is probably about two points and then the remaining balance of the eight point swing is three points of change due to mix, that's going to be the last part of it. So I guess it's more important is that three points is tied to mix, but the other five points is, let\u2019s call it some fairly unusual things either tied to volume or tied to one-time advance. "

Is this more on the detector side or I think you know it seems like that you know some of that lower end stuff was impacting your gross margin of less years and were these products actually losing money?

So that OEMs are \u2013 while they are not saying that they have bottomed out, they also don't think that the bottom is very far away.

Now as we look forward we see at worst flatish, but it\u2019s not quite there yet, but the momentum certainly feels the market that it is on the positive trend. ",

We are definitely seeing pockets of activity here and there which are strong, but at the same time some geographies and modalities are somewhat soft. So in order to come up with the guidance number for you, we kind of looked at it and kind bookended both the both the numbers that way. ",

So whether it falls in this side of the fence of the quarter or the next quarter, so that also changes the numbers a little bit.

So what we're talking about here is again the combination of debt and revolver. The revolver remains undrawn, but nonetheless the same set of covenants apply.",

So what happens in this type of a situation is that accounting standards require to disclose this, the business as a going concern irrespective of our ability to refinance or modify those covenants. But our plan is to go ahead and replace these lines of debt with new sources of debt, essentially replaces these debt with new sources of debt. "

The product lifecycle actions will continue on, the cost reduction actions where permanent, we will see the effect of - some effect of that in Q4, it will ratchet up and then going into Q1 that will continue to increase.

So there are a number of articles where the recovery will happen at a different pace from airport and oil and gas. So that's why we have our \u2013 we are anticipating that parts of industrial will recover sooner and some parts that might take longer to recover, we then in the upcoming quarters will get better visibility to how that is progressing.

The greater than $25 million cost reductions you're talking about now, is that building off of the comments from last quarter?

So that's $28 million and there are a few other things that we have in the offer here. So we are thinking you know, we may be able to do a total of cost reductions upwards of $30 million and all of them are in play, not completes, but definitely begun. We feel good about those plans. ",
            "I did rough math on that and about three quarters of that flows through the cost of sale line and a quarter of that, 25% of that will flow through OpEx. So I think it might be prudent here to kind of give you an idea of where we are kind of targeting the OpEx to land at. So by the time all these things are done, I am thinking say $44 million, $45 million a quarter type of non-GAAP OpEx run rate we would be able to achieve and I think we would be able to get there by Q2 of 2021. So their actions in Q4, Q1, etc., that will reduce costs a little bit, but the full effect will begin to print from Q2 of 2021. So that's where we are trying to land this in six months\u2019 time-frame, on the OpEx side. ",
            "And then of course on the gross margin side, these cost reductions should give us you know roughly about 3 percentage points. We are going to start getting some of these benefits little-by-little in the upcoming quarters, but by Q2 they should begin to print in the gross margin also. "
