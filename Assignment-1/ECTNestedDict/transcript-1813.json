         "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our conference call to discuss TG Therapeutics\u2019 second quarter 2020 financial results and business update. I\u2019m Jenna Bosco, TG\u2019s Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications, and I welcome you to our conference call today.",
         "Following our Safe Harbor statement, Sean Power, TG\u2019s Chief Financial Officer will provide a brief overview of our financial results and then turn the call over to Michael Weiss, the company\u2019s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer who will provide an overview of the ongoing development of our lead compounds, ublituximab and umbralisib, as well as an update on our overall company standing.",

      "Michael Weiss": [
         "Great, thanks Sean and thanks Jenna, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. It\u2019s been a truly amazing first half of 2020 for TG, and we\u2019re expecting exciting things for the second half where we will announce results from our ULTIMATE MS studies and present detailed results from our UNITY-NHL and UNITY-CLL studies. As we move into 2021, we could receive our first approval propelling us forward from a development stage company to a fully integrated commercial organization. ",
         "Let me start the call by highlighting some of this year\u2019s major accomplishments. We completed our first rolling submission of a new drug application for single agent umbralisib in the treatment of patients with previously treated marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. This was an incredible achievement for our company and I commend our team\u2019s effort in preparing this submission under such challenging circumstances. We also announced that the UNITY-CLL Phase 3 trial evaluating U2 combination in both treatment na\u00efve and previously treated CLL patients met the primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival with a P-value of less than 0.0001. ",
         "As Sean mentioned, we bolstered our balance sheet with over $240 million in new capital from our largest public offering to date as well as the use of our ATM facility. ",
         "We strengthened our scientific and medical leadership team with the addition of Dr. Owen O\u2019Connor as our Chief Scientific Officer. He joins us from Columbia University Medical Center where he most recently served as Professor of Medicine and Experimental Therapeutics and the Director of the Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, as well as co-Program Director of the Lymphoid Development and Malignancy Program at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University Medical Center.",
         "We also added Dr. Sagar Lonial to our Board of Directors. Dr. Lonial is currently serving as Professor and Chair of the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology and the Emory University School of Medicine, as well as the Chief Medical Officer at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University.",
         "We have also been hard at work building our commercial and medical affairs organizations. This team is very impressive with deep experience launching products in the hematology oncology space, and they have already made great progress advancing our launch plans. We have also had multiple data presentations and publications already this year, including the final results from the GENUINE Phase 3 trial we presented at ASCO by Dr. Jeff Sharman, Medical Director Hematology Research at U.S. Oncology, which demonstrated that the addition of ublituximab to ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival, overall response rate, complete response rate, and increased the rates of undetectable minimal residual disease as compared to ibrutinib alone. ",
         "At EHA, Dr. Chan Cheah, the Clinical Lead for Lymphoma at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and Director of the WA Lymphoma Center of Research Excellence presented preliminary safety and efficacy data of our investigational highly selective BTK inhibitor, TG-1701 as a monotherapy and in combination with U2. We are excited about this compound especially in combination with U2 and look forward to further data later this year and the initiation of additional combination trials with 1701 next year.",
         "Finally Dr. Javier Pinilla and the team at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute recently published preclinical data describing the unique immunomodulatory effects of umbralisib in Blood Advances, a journal of the American Society of Hematology. As I mentioned, it\u2019s been an exciting first half for TG. ",
         "Now let me turn to our pivotal programs and provide a high-level overview and status update for each. Let\u2019s start with the UNITY-NHL program.",
         "As a quick reminder, the UNITY-NHL trial is a multi-faceted program evaluating umbralisib monotherapy as well as combinations, including the U2 combination in a variety of disease cohorts. The umbralisib monotherapy cohorts evaluating patients with previously treated marginal zone lymphoma or follicular lymphoma have met their primary endpoints of overall response rate. Based on those results, we completed our rolling NDA submission to the FDA in June. This is a major milestone for us and a huge step forward to bringing umbralisib to patients in need. As a reminder, umbralisib received breakthrough therapy designation for patients with marginal zone lymphoma.",
         "Next I\u2019d like to discuss the UNITY-CLL trial. As a reminder, the UNITY-CLL clinical trial is a global Phase 3 randomized study of U2 versus the combination of the chemotherapy chlorambucil plus the CD20 obinutuzumab in patients with treatment-na\u00efve and relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This trial is being conducted under special protocol assessment in the FDA. In early May, we announced the UNITY-CLL trial met the primary endpoint at a pre-specified interim analysis demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in PFS with a P-value of less than 0.0001, as assessed by independent review committee. You may recall that the trial enrolled approximately 60% previously untreated, or they can be referred to as treatment na\u00efve patients, and 40% who were relapsed or refractory from prior therapy, and we are pleased to note that the PFS benefit was observed across both patient populations. If approved, we believe the U2 combination has the potential to be an important treatment option for patients with CLL. We are extremely pleased with the outcome of the study and look forward to presenting data from this trial by year end with a BLA NDA submission to follow. ",
         "Last but certainly not least, let me review our ULTIMATE program in multiple sclerosis. As a quick reminder, our ULTIMATE 1 and 2 Phase 3 trials in relapsing forms of MS are two independent global randomized multi-center trials comparing ublituximab to oral teriflunomide. The primary endpoint for each study is annualized relapse rate following 96 weeks of treatment and is designed to support submission for full approval of ublituximab in relapsing forms of MS. These trials are fully enrolled and being conducted under special protocol assessment with the FDA. Currently there is only one CD20 approved for MS, which is currently tracking to have 2020 global sales in excess of $4 billion. We believe CD20 usage will continue to grow as more physicians utilize the class earlier in the treatment paradigm. If approved, we believe ublituximab should be an attractive treatment option in the CD20 market, offering patients with MS the convenience of a one-hour infusion every six months at a competitive price. Despite some minor delays from COVID, we are pleased to report that we are still targeting releasing top line data from both studies in the fourth quarter. ",
         "We are extremely pleased with all the progress we have made thus far in 2020 despite all the challenges in this new COVID environment, and I have to say how impressed I am with the team\u2019s ability to power through and continue to achieve the ambitious milestones we\u2019ve set for ourselves this year, and we\u2019re looking forward to a very exciting next six to 12 months where we are targeting pivotal data from our ULTIMATE MS Phase 3 clinical program which, if positive, will lead to a BLA submission for ublituximab, data presentations from both UNITY-NHL and UNITY-CLL, and NDA BLA submission for the U2 combination in CLL and, if all goes well, launching our first product, umbralisib in the treatment of marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. ",
         "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the conference operator to begin the Q&A session, following which I will return to make some concluding remarks. "

If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star, zero on your telephone keypad. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ",
         "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jenna Bosco, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications. Please go ahead."

      "Sean Power": [
         "Thank you Jenna, and thanks everyone for joining us. As you may be aware, our financial results were released this morning and can be viewed on the Investors and Media section of our website.",
         "I\u2019ll begin with our cash position. We were happy to have bolstered our balance sheet during the quarter, raising more than $240 million through the combination of our public offering and the use of our ATM facility following the positive top line UNITY-CLL Phase 3 results. Accordingly, at June 30 we had cash, cash equivalents and investment securities of $275.6 million, which we believe leaves us well funded to support our operations through 2021.",
         "Our net loss for the second quarter of 2020 excluding non-cash items was approximately $45.5 million. The GAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was $52.9 million or $0.47 per share compared to a net loss of $36.2 million or $0.42 per share during the comparable quarter in 2019. Our net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2020 excluding non-cash items was approximately $85.6 million. The GAAP net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $104 million or $0.95 per share compared to a net loss of $71.4 million or $0.85 per share for the six months ended June 30, 2019.",
         "For the remainder of 2020, we expect our R&D costs to decline as our pivotal programs continue to wind down, which will be partially offset by a modest increase in G&A costs as we continue to prepare ourselves for our first commercial launch.",
         "With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike Weiss, our Executive Chairman and CEO."

            "Hi, thanks. It\u2019s [indiscernible] on for Alethia. Congratulations on all the progress this quarter. As we get closer to ASH, can you give us a sense of the sort of update we might get from the ULTRA-V study with venetoclax in terms of just the numbers of patients in follow-up, and then also wanted to see if there\u2019s any update on some of the earlier combination studies that I know you guys spoke about in the past and getting excited about it specifically.I think there\u2019s one for patients who are on BTK or venetoclax and haven\u2019t gotten to a clear response and then adding U2, and just how that\u2019s shaping up. "
         ],
         "Speaker": "Unidentified Analyst"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, so in terms of ULTRA-V, I actually don\u2019t have the exact numbers, but I would hope by ASH we\u2019d have somewhere in the order of at least 15, 20, maybe even a few more patients who have completed 12 months of treatment. I think there will be somewhere in the order of 50-ish patients, 40, 50 patients--sorry, let me just take that back. It\u2019s not ULTRA-V. ULTRA-V, the Phase 2 will not be presented until complete or until, I guess, later. This is the combination of venetoclax plus U2, is coming from our Phase 1 trial, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m referring to, so let me start over.",
            "So, we will have Phase 1 data presented later this year on the Phase 1 combination of U2 plus venetoclax, and again that\u2019s what we presented previously at ASH, and the update should hopefully include, like I said, let\u2019s call it 15 to 25 patients who have completed 12 months of treatment. In total, there should be information on around 40 to 50 patients, so that will include safety and some preliminary efficacy prior to the 12-month mark, so that\u2019s where we stand with presentations of U2 plus venetoclax. ",
            "The other study you mentioned is a smaller study. It\u2019s only in one or two centers. It\u2019s the study where we have U2 added on top of BTK or venetoclax in patients who have been on a BTK or venetoclax single agent for greater than six months and have not achieved an MRD negative or CR, and we don\u2019t have any update expected on that trial."

Could you provide a little bit more detail on your commercial team, their relevant experience, as well as the cadence and timing of building out a full [indiscernible] how many reps you\u2019ll need? Then given your portfolio of assets, you\u2019ve been focused on creating best-in-class regimens for CLL and CL and follicular lymphomas. Are there other liquid or solid tumors which you have in sight, and if so can you talk a little bit about your development strategy there? Thanks. "

         "Speaker": "Josh Schimmer"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, thanks Josh. So, in terms of the commercial team, we brought on Adam Waldman who headed up the U.S. hematology franchise for Celgene in his last position, but he went up the ranks in lots of different positions and commercialization at Celgene. He\u2019s put together a pretty remarkable team. We now have heads of all functional areas for the commercialization team, including commercial operations, we have a head of market access, we have a head of medical affairs, and hopefully soon we\u2019ll be able to announce a head of sales, so the whole team is coming together. I\u2019d say the leadership has been either primarily from Celgene or from Bristol and the teams below them are really coming together nicely. ",
            "So, I don\u2019t know how much more detail you want than that, but at some point we\u2019ll get Adam on the road in the next several months--well, not on the road but virtually on the road at some point, and he can give obviously more details and chat in depth. But if you want more detail, just let me know.",
            "Then in terms of other areas, obviously our core focus has been the indolent lymphomas and leukemia, so that\u2019s obviously chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the largest and then we have follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma. Outside of that, we do have exploratory opportunities or studies going on in diffuse large B cell and in mantle cell lymphoma, which are, I\u2019d say, again earlier and more exploratory, but it is possible--I mean, we certainly have a notion that we will push into those areas eventually, whether it\u2019s with U2 or with other pieces of our portfolio. We\u2019re excited about our anti-CD47/CD19 bi-specific antibody that could be certainly used in diffuse large B cell, as well as the indolent disease that we\u2019re currently covering. We think there\u2019s an opportunity for PDL1 to work in combination with some of the agents in the portfolio in more aggressive lymphomas as well, so again diffuse large B cell and possible mantle cell there, and we know that BTK inhibitors work in mantle cell so that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be exploring as we move forward. ",
            "Again, we\u2019re sticking pretty close to our core of our indolent diseases, but in terms of B cells on the docket, certainly we\u2019ll be looking at diffuse large B cell and mantle cell as some future potential. It\u2019s obviously too early to say too much."

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Maybe a couple of specific follow-ups, if I can. In terms of the number of sales reps you expect to be launching with and whether you\u2019ll hire them prior to approval or subsequent, and then on additional indications, some other PI3 kinase inhibitors have shown effect in some large indications like myelofibrosis or myeloma. Are either of those on your radar screen as well?"

      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, so I\u2019ll take the second question first before I forget it, and then I\u2019ll go back to the sales force sizing. In terms of multiple myeloma, we haven\u2019t done too much yet, but obviously the team, Adam and some of the other folks that have come over from Celgene, are very familiar with the myeloma market, and we do have Dr. Lonial on the board, who is a recognized expert in multiple myeloma, so I think we will start to think about if there is an opportunity for us in myeloma and we\u2019ve got some pieces in place to at least do a pretty good exploration of that. ",
            "In terms of myelofibrosis, we\u2019ve already presented some pretty interesting and compelling data of umbralisib in combination with ruxolitinib in myelofibrosis, so that\u2019s an area that we are taking a more serious interest in. We\u2019re starting to explore that somewhat seriously.",
            "The other part of that I would note is that we do have a BET inhibitor that is ready to enter the clinic as soon as we can get there, which could be very soon, so we do think there\u2019s an opportunity. There\u2019s been some data that\u2019s presented where BET inhibitor has worked nicely in combination with ruxolitinib. I would argue that our umbralisib data in combination with ruxolitinib is just as good as the BET data that\u2019s been presented, but the possibility of putting all three together, our PI3K, our BET in combination with ruxolitinib is something that we\u2019re excited about, we\u2019re thinking about and could be started in the relatively near term.",
            "In terms of sales force sizing, I think the general idea is that I think we\u2019d want to probably grow to a sales force at CLL launch, and this is approximate because we haven\u2019t completed the sizing studies, but just give or take 75-ish on the sales team, and then so as we launch with marginal zone and follicular, our plan is at the time of the launch itself, we would expect to have probably half of that 75 in place for our follicular-marginal launch and then grow the sales force to that full size by the time of the CLL launch. It\u2019s kind of a staged approach. In terms of--we won\u2019t wait to hire the first, call it 30 or 35, we will not wait until after the approval. Those people will be on board in advance of the PDUFA date. ",
            "Like I said, those numbers are not--don\u2019t lock me in, but those are in the range of. It could be plus or minus five or so, or 10 or so in each of those numbers, and like I said, Adam will probably give some more color over the coming months as the sales force sizing exercise is complete."

         "Remarks": [
            "Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple, maybe if you could review what you think your biggest challenge to launching umbralisib I going to be. Is it going to be convincing them that the tolerability is better than others in the class, or is it going to be on efficacy? Just how you\u2019re going to be approaching that, and then also I\u2019m sure you\u2019re having conversations with payors right now, if you\u2019re seeing any issues or pushback to coverage there. Then lastly, just if you can discuss your European strategy. Thank you."

      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, I\u2019m going to go reverse chron on the questions. So European strategy, we\u2019re still trying to figure that out so I don\u2019t have any updates there. We are studying whether it makes sense for us to partner or to go it alone in Europe, and I think TBD is the best I can offer today. Give me another quarter and we\u2019ll give you a little more information perhaps.",
            "In terms of the number two question, which was payors, we don\u2019t expect to have any payor issues. We have been engaging with payors. To my knowledge - I\u2019m not on the front lines of that exercise, but to my knowledge we\u2019re not seeing any pushback to coverage. Typically the cancer drugs don\u2019t see too much pushback in payor coverage, but again we don\u2019t expect to see issues and engagement has begun. ",
            "Then I\u2019d say the number one question, which is obviously--well, they\u2019re all important questions, the number one question is what\u2019s going to be our greatest challenge in commercializing umbralisib in marginal zone and follicular. Look - personally I don\u2019t see too many barriers. We\u2019ve done a lot of ad boards with community oncologists to try to get a feel for the marketplace. There\u2019s some folks who have some negative--remaining negative impression of PI3K deltas. I\u2019d say once you show them the data and explain to them the fundamental differences between this molecule and the first generation PI3K inhibitors, that their concerns melt relatively quickly. Then there\u2019s some folks who are just completely open to novel treatment options, so I think our greatest challenge is just getting out there and educating folks. ",
            "I feel like in my head, we\u2019re like the five sins of biotech - we need to make sure--you know, an educated consumer is our best consumer. The better people understand the value proposition that umbralisib brings to them and their patients, the better off we\u2019re going to be, and we\u2019ve just got to get folks to try umbralisib. Once they do, relatively immediately the vast, vast majority will notice that this is a very different compound and a different profile with their patients. ",
            "It\u2019s not a perfect drug - let me just be clear, there are going to be some folks who don\u2019t have a good experience on the drug, but the vast majority will and that\u2019s in contrast to the first generation, where it was kind of the reverse, right - most people had a bad experience. Our goal is to get folks to try. We feel like we\u2019ve got a really good leading--because of our clinical trial sites, we had so many community oncologists who have used the compound already and have been participating in our studies, that obviously that\u2019s a place we\u2019re going to start. We\u2019re going to work with those folks to make sure that they\u2019re engaged and are interested in treating their patients with the drug, which so far has come back very positively. Then each one of those clinical trial sites represents typically a lot more than the clinical investigators who participate in the trial, so it\u2019s leveraging the relationships in those clinical trial sites to get their co-investigators or partners to also try umbralisib in their practice.",
            "We\u2019re feeling good about it. I\u2019m feeling great. From what I\u2019ve seen and what I\u2019ve heard, I feel we\u2019re going to do quite well. Again, marginal zone and follicular are not the biggest indications, so obviously we have realistic expectations of what early sales can be in those indications, but I think in terms of getting a really great start into a CLL launch by getting more people to try the drug and use it and get comfortable with it is just going to make us that much more successful one we get to CLL, so education-education-education. Once people understand this compound and try it, we\u2019re going to be in a better position."

         "Remarks": [
            "I\u2019m sorry. Sorry Matt, somehow my phone got on mute. Yes, so what I was saying is for the BTK in terms of regulatory strategy, CLL is an area of great interest, and then obviously marginal zone lymphoma is one. In both those indications, we\u2019ve treated a number of patients with U2 plus ibrutinib, we\u2019ve treated a number of patients with U2 plus 1701. I think between CLL and marginal zone, of basically U2 plus BTK, I don\u2019t--I think it\u2019s 100% response rate across both those indications thus far. Now of course, larger trials will bring that down - it won\u2019t be 100%, we can be confident of that, but it\u2019s going to be very high response rates when we use U2 plus BTK, so that\u2019s something that we are excited about for both those indications where BTKs are indicated and U2 ought to be indicated, let\u2019s say that. ",
            "Then there is follicular lymphoma, where BTK doesn\u2019t have as much activity but could be interesting on top of U2. There\u2019s mantle cell lymphoma where BTK alone is interesting and potentially U2 plus BTK could be interesting, so we think there is registration opportunities across those indications. ",
            "In terms of CD47/CD19, it\u2019s way too early, but we would certainly start targeting into diffuse large B cell and follicular with that agent. The earlier data with a competitive compound did look quite interesting in both follicular and diffuse large B cell once it was combine with a CD20, so that\u2019s something we\u2019ll try to get a look at as early as we can. Hopefully at some point next year, we\u2019ll be expanding that program."

I will have a quick follow-up after that. Thank you. "

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, Roger. Yes, so you brought up two modalities that are starting to take hold in follicular, so you\u2019ve got EZH2 which is what I would describe as a pretty mild treatment option, it\u2019s an oral therapy with a pretty good safety profile, and then on the other side you have very high efficacy, high toxicity CAR Ts and bispecifics. I think generally speaking for umbralisib, it\u2019s a, we believe, a very nice level of activity with a very nice safety profile that fits well into treatment of earlier lines of follicular lymphoma, so typically you want to treat these patients with the drugs that are easiest to handle early on and see if you can get the maximum amount of benefit out of those agents, and later on you\u2019ll look at potentially using more aggressive therapies like the CAR Ts or the bispecifics. ",
            "I think there is room for all of these therapies across the line, but typically it\u2019s your milder, less toxic therapies early and your more aggressive treatments later on for these patients. They\u2019re not currently curable, so in that light you want to make sure you try something that\u2019s easy for them to handle, giving them the best quality of life for the longest period of time, so I think we\u2019re going to fit in very nicely in the first few lines of therapy. I think once you get into what some describe as sort of salvage settings, you\u2019ll start to see people using CAR Ts and bispecifics.",
            "In terms of EZH2, I think as a standalone agent it certainly has activity, but I think they\u2019ll find their home at some point in combination, and obviously we think umbralisib is a very nice standalone agent. U2 over time, we think U2 will be more efficacious than umbralisib alone and U2 plus, whether it\u2019s BTK or some other combination, or U2 plus CD47 or U2 plus PDL1, or something even external to the portfolio could be interesting. But again, our goal is to layer as many, what I\u2019d describe as lower toxicity agents together to come up with a highly efficacious regimen that still maintains a low overall toxicity profile. That\u2019s always been our plan. We\u2019ve tried to avoid nuclear bombs and we\u2019ve chosen to use multiple therapies at once to try to triangulate the tumor."

Any changes that might be going into efficacy analysis, and then also your thoughts on some of the recent competitive readouts on the oral side, thinking of Principia\u2019s BTK and maybe Immunex\u2019s product as well."

      },
      "37": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, so in terms of the study conclusion and COVID, as we mentioned, I think on our last conference call, we were definitely impressed by the fact that 90, 95% of the patients did come in relatively on time for their visits. There were some stragglers, and that carried forward into whatever they had left in terms of 84, 96-week visits. I think for the first trial, we ended up getting the last visit in about two or three weeks after the expected time frame, so pretty darn good all things considered, so we\u2019ve got the second one coming up and we expect potentially the same, or maybe a little bit better given that most of Europe is doing pretty well right now. ",
            "Again, we\u2019re talking about potential delays in final visits of the two, three weeks. Having said that, none of it really will affect or should affect the timing of the closeout of the trial. They\u2019re still cleaning data, so the fact that one or two patients come in a little bit late, it\u2019s not like everything else is clean at that point so the stragglers don\u2019t really impact the overall timeline. ",
            "What could have an effect on the overall timeline is, again, just access to sites to clean data, to get to a locked database, and that\u2019s something we don\u2019t have a good--you know? Actually most of the sites are open for cleaning, so that\u2019s good. There\u2019s a few sites that are not and they\u2019ve been doing some stuff virtually, so it\u2019s all, in my opinion, heading towards a pretty typical conclusion to the trial without too much of an impact or not much at all from COVID.",
            "In terms of the BTK inhibitors in multiple sclerosis, the current KOL interactions we\u2019ve had tell us that these are not competitors to CD20s. They\u2019re not viewed as nearly efficacious levels. These are interesting compounds, I\u2019m sure, for their developers and they will compete in the world of oral therapy, so I think the world of oral therapies includes multiple underlying mechanistic agents, but they all compete for the oral marketplace and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard about the BTKs. ",
            "The first data that came out on the Merck compound was not overly impressive from the KOL perspective that we spoke to, so it spoke to a number of KOLs that data came out, I forgot which conference, but we had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with a bunch of folks and the general consensus was it\u2019s okay, nothing too spectacular in terms of its competition in the oral space, and certainly not in the same class with the power of a CD20.",
            "In terms of the version of the oral BTK that crosses the blood-brain barrier, again it\u2019s one of those scientific stories that gets a bunch of KOLs excited, which then gets maybe some big pharma excited. The practical application of crossing the blood-brain barrier is probably limited to primary progressive disease, may have some applications in secondary progressive disease, but as you can see in relapsing forms of MS, the complete blockade of B cells by CD20 is super active and the concept of a molecule, BTK or otherwise, crossing the blood-brain barrier is--like I said, it\u2019s scientifically interesting but the clinical likelihood that that\u2019s going to make a material difference in the overall outcome for patients with a compound that is--you know, with a BTK effect at least in the first go-round was marginally active in relapsing forms to think it\u2019s going to have some miraculous effect in progressive forms. ",
            "Again, it\u2019s a hypothesis, clearly someone is spending a lot of money to vet that hypothesis in large clinical trials, and we\u2019ll get the answer, but in the end it\u2019s not really a competitor to what we\u2019re doing. Our competition is in the CD20 class. We know what that class looks like. You\u2019ve got two agents, one IV and one oral. We know the current development plans on both and future development plans. We think we\u2019re going to have a very nice role to play in the CD20 marketplace, which alone is expected to be close to $10 billion, so I think it\u2019s a big market and a great opportunity for TG and for ublituximab."

Toward the end of the year or early next year, we\u2019re also targeting regulatory submissions for U2 for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and around the same time we could potentially have our first FDA approval for umbralisib in previously treated marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.
