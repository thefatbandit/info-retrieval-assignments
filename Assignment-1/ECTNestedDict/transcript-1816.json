         "Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $314 million flat with the prior year, and up 2% from the prior quarter. Year-to-date, revenue was $920 million, up 8% from the prior year.",
         "Our Applications segment revenues were $141 million, down 15% versus the same period last year. This decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower license revenue. As you may recall, we had a very large license component in Q3 last year due to renewals, which under ASC 606 accounting standards require upfront revenue recognition even though we build a customer as an annual subscription.",
         "Software applications billings for the quarter were $61 million flat versus last year, and up 27% from our second quarter, where we had significant COVID-related disruptions and sales efforts at the end of March.",
         "In our Decision Management Software segment, Q3 revenues were $41 million, up 22% over the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to SaaS subscription revenues in our decision management platform. DMS bookings were $29 million in Q3, down 22% from the previous year, but up 25% from the last quarter.",
         "Finally, our Scores segment revenues were $132 million, up 14% from the same period last year. B2B was up 12% over the same period, and B2C revenues were up 21% from Q3 2019. In our third fiscal quarter, 79% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 14% and the remaining 7% was from Asia-Pacific.",
         "Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources represented 79% of total revenues in the quarter. Consulting and implementation revenue were 14% of total revenues and license revenues were 7%. Revenues derived from our cloud delivered software as a service or SaaS were $77 million for the quarter, an increase of 11% over the prior year that included $61 million of transactional software revenue and $16 million in professional services.",
         "Bookings for the quarter totaled $106 million, down 3% from last year, but up 26% from last quarter. These bookings generated $16 million of current period revenues, a 15% yield. SaaS bookings were $40 million for the quarter, down 12% from the previous year, but up 31% from last quarter.",
         "Our operating expenses totaled $231 million this quarter, down $1 million from the prior quarter. This is due primarily to decreases in travel, marketing and other discretionary expenses. We expect Q4 expenses to be moderately higher.",
         "Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown in our Reg G schedule was 34% for the quarter. GAAP net income this quarter was $64 million flat with the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $77 million for the quarter, which was up 1% from the same quarter last year.",
         "Our effective tax rate this quarter was about 16%, which included $5 million of excess tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation activities. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 9% to 11% for the fiscal year. As a reminder, our recurring tax rate before these excess tax benefits is approximately 25% to 26% globally.",
         "Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million compared to $61 million in the same period last year, an increase of 63%. Free cash flow this quarter benefited from a large reduction in the working capital year-over-year, primarily related to unusually high accounts receivables at the end of Q3 2019. Free cash flow for the trailing 4 quarters was $297 million.",
         "Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, we had $126 million in cash, which is up $19 million from last quarter due to cash generated from ops, partially offset by share repurchases. Our total debt face value is $938 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%. At the end of the quarter, we had drawn $103 million on our $400 million revolving line of credit. We further drew on that facility to pay for the $85 million maturity of senior notes in July.",
         "Our leverage ratio as calculated for revolving line of credit was 2.16, and our covenant as you may recall is 3.25 on the revolver. We bought back 157,000 shares in the third quarter for $54 million at an average price of $343 per share. And today, we announced the new board authorization for $250 million of share repurchase.",
         "Finally, as Will said, because of the current uncertain economic environment, we are not providing formal financial guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2020.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Will for some final comments."

      "Operator": [
         "Greetings and welcome to the FICO Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we\u2019ll conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 29, 2020.",
         "And now, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please, go ahead."
      ],
      "Steven Weber": [
         "Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings Call. I\u2019m Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations. And I\u2019m joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin.",
         "Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business.",
         "Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements may involve many uncertainties including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company\u2019s business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.",
         "This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company\u2019s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website at fico.com or on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through July 29, 2021.",
         "And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Will Lansing.",
         "Thanks, Will. We will now take your questions. Operator, please open the line."
      ],
      "William Lansing": [
         "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I hope you and your families are healthy and staying safe as we go through this pandemic. We continue to work primarily from home. Most of our offices are remaining closed. I\u2019m pleased to say this model has worked very well for us.",
         "Our productivity metrics remain very strong. And we\u2019re able to innovate, meet development deadlines, serve our customers and implement our solutions. We posted some slides with our results on the Investor Relations section of our website. I\u2019ll be referencing some of those slides during our presentation today. I\u2019ll go over the results of our third fiscal quarter and discuss what we\u2019re seeing in the markets that we serve.",
         "I am pleased to report that we had another very strong quarter, which demonstrates the remarkable resiliency of our business. As shown on Slide 2, we reported revenues of $314 million, flat with the same period last year, which was our highest revenue quarter ever.",
         "We delivered $64 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $2.15 per share. We delivered $77 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $2.58. We also delivered $99 million of free cash flow in the quarter, the highest single quarter in company history. As you can see, on Slide 3, we continue to have ample liquidity. We actually reduced our total debt by about $20 million from the end of our second quarter.",
         "We generated $106 million in new bookings and have a very strong pipeline of deals as we move into the fourth quarter. Our software revenue was down 8% this quarter due to the difficult comparison to last year, when we have large application renewal revenue.",
         "This quarter, the application segment was down 15%, primarily due to lower upfront license revenues. Decision Management Software was up 22%, primarily due to increases in recurring transactional revenues.",
         "In the Scores business, we had another record quarter, despite the volatility in the credit markets. Total revenues were up 14% versus the prior year and totaled $132 million. B2C revenues were up 21% this quarter with strong growth in both myFICO and indirect partner channels.",
         "On the B2B side, revenues were up 12% over the same period as last year. This is especially encouraging as this is an area that can be highly volatile in uncertain economic times. We saw strength in the mortgage markets throughout the quarter with volumes up due to low interest rates.",
         "In auto, volumes are down significantly at the start of the quarter and improved over the balance of the quarter. For cards and other unsecured lending, marketing and originations volumes were down throughout the quarter, as financial institutions slowed new card acquisition efforts. Obviously, there\u2019s still a great deal of volatility in these markets with record unemployment and furloughs.",
         "We also continue to innovate in Scores. Last month, we introduced the FICO Resilience Index, an analytic tool that complements the FIFO score and helps lenders, borrowers and investors to identify the financial resiliency of consumers across FIFO Score bands to make more informed and precise decisions in assessing risk during rapidly changing economic cycles.",
         "In general, in a down economy, access to credit goes down as lenders try to mitigate the credit risk. The FICO Resilience Index can be helpful in navigating through changing economic cycles. The desired outcome is a system that is even more precise in assessing and pricing risk and less prone to broad credit restrictions and risk pricing, which can tighten the flow of credit during an economic downturn.",
         "As we navigate through the current economic climate, I\u2019m extremely pleased with the performance of our business. Last quarter, we retracted our full-year guidance due to widespread economic uncertainty. We now have additional data points, but markets have yet to stabilize. So while we won\u2019t give formal guidance, we are offering additional visibility into how various metrics are trending as we finish our fiscal year.",
         "If you look at Slide 4, an updated version of what we showed last quarter, you\u2019ll see how we performed in Q3 and where we stand year to date versus our original guidance. We\u2019re trending well in Scores with both B2B and B2C ahead of our original guidance.",
         "On the Software side, we\u2019re slightly behind in transactional and maintenance volumes as reduced economic activity has slowed volumes. We also have risk in license sales and services revenue. Our fourth quarter tends to be the highest sales quarter for us. And we have a strong pipeline of deals.",
         "We see clients accelerating their digital transformation plans where we play a central role. But again, with the uncertain economic environment, it\u2019s difficult to commit to specific revenue numbers. On the expense side, we\u2019re spending well below what was embedded in our guidance. As a result, we will likely have some savings versus what we expected at the beginning of the year.",
         "While there are still many moving pieces, we now believe it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll be able to hit our previously guided pre-tax income and net income numbers,",
         "In many ways this is the most difficult health and economic environment we\u2019ve ever faced. At the same time, we have a very resilient business model, and we\u2019re actively managing the business to work through the near-term difficulties with an eye toward our long-term strategy.",
         "I\u2019ll share some summary thoughts later. But now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.",
         "As we work to finish our fiscal year and build plans for fiscal 2021, I\u2019m confident that FICO is well positioned for the future. We\u2019re built to withstand economic downturns and are taking steps to manage through current uncertainties without sacrificing our commitment to our strategic initiatives.",
         "As I\u2019ve said before, we are stewards of remarkable assets. And we have a great team dedicated to helping our customers solve their most difficult problems. And the value of the analytic solutions we provide both in software and in Scores is more important now than ever. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve to manage the Q&A."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you. Good evening, guys. My first question is just on the B2B Scores business. I think the 10% growth felt a little bit light to us. So I was just hoping you could walk us through what that mix between price and volume was there, maybe versus the last quarter, even actually like you then missing the pricing element or the mix of your different lending categories in there."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. Manav, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve ever broken out the mix between the volume and the price. The volume was a little bit lighter, as you\u2019d expect over a quarter like this one, so some of that was price."

         "Remarks": [
            "And, Manav, I\u2019ll just speak to \u2013 maybe give you a little more directional view on that. Look, we happen to report earnings after Equifax and TransUnion, also after Visa. And you can see some of the trends that would underlie our results in the B2B Scores business, particularly on the origination side from what they\u2019re showing. Obviously, mortgage volumes were very, very strong. Auto volumes seem to be picking up, but for the quarter we\u2019re down. And on the personal loan and credit card side of things, we\u2019re seeing the same things that the bureaus saw in the period.",
            "Now, that bureau data also seems to suggest that the trend is improving, but there is certainly no assurance that that\u2019s going to maintain itself. And, of course, when you look at the pricing across the 3 segments, I think you understand well the strategic pricing actions we took in the, what is our other category, credit cards, personal loans, and so forth. And that category suffered the worst in terms of volumes, but the pricing actions helped mitigate that."

I think there is this kind of additional care being taken with everything that our customers do. That said, they are full steam ahead on digital transformation, on upgrading their solutions.

And so I wanted to see whether those improvements that they\u2019re describing are showing up in your results. Did you see them in the June results? Are you seeing them in July?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. Also on the B2C, to follow up on Manav\u2019s comments, that looks like a very strong quarter. TransUnion noted though, since they are a big supplier in the indirect space that they were a little concerned about the second half of the year, just because they were concerned that the aggregators are not seeing a lot of demand from the banks, meaning the banks are not very aggressive these days at trying to add new accounts.",
            "And so, I just wanted to touch-base on whether you felt comfortable with those volumes \u2013 with that level of growth continuing, because you can see the inside much better than we can, so."

The one thing that\u2019s clear though is consumers are more focused, more interested in what\u2019s going on with their credit score than they\u2019ve ever been before. And we\u2019re seeing it in myFICO. We\u2019re seeing it in our partner consumer stuff.",

         "Remarks": [
            "So Experian Boost is doing very well. And as you know, that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s boosting a FICO score and so there\u2019s a benefit to FICO every time Boost happens. UltraFICO is lagging now, and largely because of the success that we\u2019re having with Boost."

What I would tell you is that \u2013 what we\u2019re seeing is tremendous appetite for our new solutions and our new Decision Management Platform, and deal size is getting bigger. And we now have banks that are adopting our solution, our Decision Management Platform solution, and then building all kinds of use cases on top of it. So we feel like we\u2019re being vindicated in the strategic direction. At the same time, we \u2013 it does require investment. We continue to pour investment in. When will margins improve? There\u2019ll be some margin improvement over time as we scale up our SaaS business and have more multi-tenant and returns to scale. So there\u2019ll be some benefits there.",
            "And I think, professional services \u2013 as our products become simpler to install and a little bit easier, the proportion of professional services will go down, which will also be a margin improvement. So those are the factors but I can\u2019t give you a timeline. I would tell you that we will continue to invest at this rate as long as it feels like those are smart decisions, like those are intelligent decisions given the appetite of the market for our staff."

I know from time-to-time, you\u2019ve talked about how you\u2019ve developed your own \u2013 some of the new generations of your products are actually being built on the DMS platform and you use a lot of tools internally to do that. There was some talk about sometime over maybe the next 18 to 24 months, taking those tools and turning them outward, meaning that you\u2019d have this whole ecosystem similar to salesforce.com or Workday, and having developers being able to develop customized tools on that platform.

It\u2019s the way that we intend to reach other verticals besides financial services.

So I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding it correctly. So are you saying that you have not yet been paid for the credit pulls at the bureaus in June, because it\u2019s not only that it\u2019s reported to you like in arrears at the end of the month, but you\u2019re actually paid kind of on a lagged basis and you recognize revenue on a lagged basis?"

That said, it looks really good. So what you have the situation where the very biggest banks, our biggest customers, absolute top tier banks, they have super complicated systems and they still buy some point solutions, and we have not yet had a top 10 bank stay to us, yeah, we\u2019re adopting the FICO Decision Management Platform for all of our consumer facing decisioning. That hasn\u2019t happened yet. However, it is happening with a tier down.",

And then we\u2019re going to build all kinds of different credit decisions around that. And now we\u2019re moving up market and so we have some pretty good-sized banks that have made the decision to adopt it. And sometimes it\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019ll start with a point solution they were in the market for and recognize the expansion opportunity. And sometimes, they do it very deliberately, with a view to putting a whole lot of different use cases on top of the platform once it\u2019s been adopted.

It seems like you\u2019ve had some nice growth there for several of the last few quarters. Is the SaaS momentum kind of rolling strong enough where we can expect this growth to be able to continue?

And so on a percentage basis, it can move quickly, because we\u2019re dealing with smaller numbers. That said, there is \u2013 we have evermore solutions on top of the platform, it\u2019s very much our future. It\u2019s the way our salespeople are selling. It is the way the banks are buying it. And it is a very different world than it was 3 or 4 years ago. So while we still have sales of legacy product, and our legacy solutions will be around for a long time to come, because they\u2019re best-in-class at what they do.

It can create some distortions in revenue when you sell an on-prem subscription product for 3, 5 years. That on-prem portion, in most cases, needs to be recognized all at once upfront, despite the fact that it\u2019s a subscription. But if it\u2019s a SaaS sale, it is recognized ratably as we bill and deliver it. So it can be lumpy for that reason alone, and not reflecting the underlying health of the business.",

We don\u2019t imagine that we\u2019ll ever go back to the level of travel, we had before. I think that all of us not just like but our customers and our \u2013 everyone involved is now way more adept at using Zoom and doing more video. And what we\u2019re finding is, we can have comparable, if not more contact with our customers with less travel. And so \u2013 and it\u2019s obviously more efficient and a much lower cost. So I would imagine some of it\u2019s going to survive in a post-COVID world. That said, it is unnaturally low right now. So you can expect it to go up from the level it\u2019s at now, you can expect it to be lower than it was a year ago on an ongoing basis."

But it seems that the Scores boxes \u2013 the Scores number is 63 and 18, those seems like hittable targets and wondering, are those not green boxed, because they\u2019re a little harder to predict?

There\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d say, the 2 biggest ones that aren\u2019t there yet are Falcon and debt manager. And those will be \u2013 those will take longer.
