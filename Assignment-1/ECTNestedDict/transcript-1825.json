      "Brian Bird": [
         "Thanks, Bob. On Page 4 of the presentation is the summary financial results for the second quarter. As Bob pointed out, our net income is down $26.2 million. As I look at this slide, there are really three themes jump out, gross margin is down $6.7 million on a year-over-year basis. All of that negative variance could be reflected by two 2019 favorable impacts. The second thing I am \u2013 the theme I point out is, the reduction in OG&A expenses that we had during the quarter more than offset the increases in property tax, depreciation and interest expense. ",
         "And the third theme is the $21.5 million negative variance in income taxes is all attributed to the 2019 favorable impact, of course on a year-over-year basis. So, taking those things in consideration, we feel we actually had a very good quarter in line with our expectations from a COVID perspective. ",
         "And with that, I will turn you to the following page on gross margin. Gross margin was off $6.7 million or about 3% as I pointed out. All of that really attributed to our electric business. You look at the primary drivers of the $8.2 million of change in gross margin actually impacts net income, the very first two items Montana electric supply cost recovery, that item is after some favorable legislation we received. We were able to treat our PCAM slightly different and we had a favorable adjustment in 2019 associated with that, that\u2019s $4.4 million. ",
         "And then, this year our QF gain was $3.3 million less than the QF gain we had in 2019. Those two items together are 8. \u2013 excuse me \u2013 7.7 of the full 8.2 change in gross margin. I guess, the other item that would get fully to the 8.2 is lower electric transmission and really is a result on a year-over-year impact. So the closure of Units 1and 2 at Colstrip. ",
         "So, all in all, again, big impact associated with the 2019 favorable items impacting the $8.2 million. Below that, we do show changes in gross margins, that\u2019s offset elsewhere within the P&L for a net decrease in gross margin of $6.7 million. ",
         "Also on Page 5, to the far right, we do have a red box speaking to COVID. You notice I didn\u2019t say anything about electric or gas retail volumes. The reason being is, they were essentially flat. They were flat, our customer growth and favorable weather were effectively offset to a great extent by a $3 million to $4 million negative impact on revenues associated with COVID. ",
         "As expected, commercial and industrial volumes were down and residential volumes partially offset that, again from a margin perspective, relatively flat. ",
         "Moving forward on weather, it is a colder quarter for us and as expected didn\u2019t have much of a weather impact. We had a $500,000 favorable pre-tax benefit when compared to normal and a $800,000 pre-tax benefit compared to Q2 of 2019. If you look at the map of the bottom left side of Page 6, in April, we did have colder temperatures that helped our heating in our Montana gas business.",
         "In June, we had warmer weather in South Dakota which helped the South Dakota Electric business. Those two things are the primary drivers for our favorable weather during the quarter. ",
         "Moving on to operating expenses on Page 7. They are down $2.6 million or nearly 2% on a year-over-year basis. The biggest driver of course is OG&A expenses and I\u2019ll speak to that in a minute. Property taxes are up slightly as a result of increased valuation in \u2013 for our Montana property taxes. ",
         "And depreciation expenses was up $3.8 million, of that $3.8 million increase, $2.3 million is associated with a 2019 favorable impact associated with the settlement of our rate case where we booked an incremental benefit, the depreciation expense part of that rate case settlement. ",
         "Jumping to the items that impacting OG&A is, the three biggest of the $9.7 million decrease in OG&A of items impacting net income was a reduction in employee benefits. We had lower medical. We had lower incentive costs. Note there we are also highlighting those costs reduced that had an impact or increased had an impact associated with COVID and I\u2019ll speak to that in a minute. ",
         "So, employee benefits decreased to $3.7 million. We had $2.6 million of lower generation maintenance at DDGS in some of our South Dakota generation facilities. We had lower labor costs, some associated with how we changed work around COVID, some attributed to allocation of more labor to capital. We had lower hazard trees and anticipated having lower hazard trees based upon the good progress we made in 2019 in that regard. ",
         "And then, lower travel and training, about $1.2 million to be expected with what\u2019s going on with COVID. Those benefits were partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in uncollectable accounts during the quarter and we had some other impacts as well totaling $9.7 million of items that impacted net income. ",
         "Below that, of course, there are some items changes in OG&A that are offset elsewhere in the P&L for a net decrease of $9.1 million in OG&A for the quarter. To the far right, again, we show the COVID related impacts, $3.1 million increased in uncollectable accounts offset by $2.8 million of lower COVID related expenses and think of lower medical, lower labor and travel and training for that $2.8 million. We\u2019ll give you a full P&L on COVID here later in the presentation. ",
         "Moving forward just, operating income at the top of the page up $4 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Moving down to pre-tax, down about $4.7 million, primarily that change is driven by an increase in interest expense. Almost all of that attributed to COVID and the need to have incremental borrowings to improve our liquidity during the quarter. ",
         "Below pre-tax income, a $21.5 million increase in income taxes, again, almost all of that really attributed to the $23 million favorable item in 2019 that was taken. That leads us to \u2013 again the $26 million decrease on a quarter-over-quarter basis in net income. And we are going to stop there for a second and just point out and you take into consideration this $7.7 million of negative impact this year on margin associated with the 2019 favorable impact items. Take the $2.3 million favorable item associated with depreciation in 2019, that\u2019s $10 million on a pre-tax basis, after-tax just round numbers, $7 million after-tax associated with that. ",
         "Obviously, $23 million of after-tax benefit in 2019, that\u2019s a $30 million swing on an after-tax basis. And so, for the quarter, just removing those 2019, all of the 2019 items I discussed, we would had $4 million favorable on a year-over-year basis. Add to that, we will show the P&L in a minute. Approximately, $3 million of an after-tax detriment that we received in 2020 associated with COVID, if you back that out, we would have net \u2013 be an up $7 million for the quarter.",
         "So, obviously, from a headline perspective it didn\u2019t look like a great quarter. But from our perspective, we feel good knowing what we know with that in COVID and where are we going forward. ",
         "Moving to Page 9 on income taxes. I talked about $21.5 million increase, again associated with the recognition of an unrecognized tax benefit in 2019, partially offset by lower pretax income and slightly better flow-through repairs on a year-to-date and on a quarterly basis. ",
         "Balance sheet, not much to talk about on Page 10. We did had an increase in PP&E with a $100 million increase in short-term debt by $100 million is probably the biggest changes since the end of the year 2019 and you can see on a debt-to-capital perspective to bottom of the page, very little change around 52% debt-to-cap. ",
         "On cash flow, on Page 11, cash from operations is approximately $75 million better on a year-over-year basis. Really three things drove that improvement in collections on supply cost this year. In 2019, we were giving refunds to customers associated with TCJA. We are also giving some transmission interconnection refunds in 2019. ",
         "Those three items were partially offset by lower net income this year to again approximately $75 million improvement there. ",
         "Thinking of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings on Page 12, we see at the bottom on the page, diluted EPS of $0.43 on a GAAP basis really taking out a penny for favorable weather this quarter as to $0.42. That compared to a non-GAAP number of $0.50 last year. We did - in that case, we had unfavorable weather of a penny and added back the tax benefit and that was received in 2019. ",
         "So again, $0.08 detriment on a year-over-year basis. The main thing I\u2019d point also on this page is, pretax income on a non-GAAP to non-GAAP basis is down slightly from our GAAP, primarily as a result of the $800,000 swing in favorable weather. And then \u2013 but I also say the net income improved significantly when you remove the tax benefit, now net income there is shown as $4 million less. And again, equates to $0.08 on an EPS basis. ",
         "Moving forward, Page 13, diluted earnings per share reaffirming our previously revised earnings guidance at $3.30 to $3.45 per diluted share. We do know our assumptions. Obviously, one of the big assumptions we have in remaining years is our expectations on COVID and not only an impact on or margins, but also the ability to recover collectibles, uncollectable account expense from commissions where we made filings, obviously normal weather and a share count of 50.9 million and a tax range of minus 5% to 0%. ",
         "Lastly, on this page, I\u2019d point out, we do have a - continue to have our 6% to 9% total return as a long-term look from our perspective. And of course, that\u2019s going to be derived through a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield. ",
         "Moving on to just the change in our bridge associated with the revised guidance and thinking through COVID. We can save $1.48 for the first two quarters of the year and we\u2019ll need $1.82 to $1.97 to achieve the $3.30 to $3.45 range that we discussed. That means we\u2019ll need an improvement on a year-over-year basis of $0.13 to $0.29 and where will that benefit primarily come from. ",
         "It\u2019s going to continue to come from OG&A expense and it\u2019s going to come from tax timing. And one thing I\u2019d point out is, we had $0.14 improvement on OG&A expense in the second quarter alone and so, we do expect if COVID continues, we\u2019ll have a relatively easy time achieving that $0.08 to $0.11 if not better in that regard. ",
         "So, and we are going to work extremely hard to stay on top of that. We also know that we have a tax timing swing. Those two things again will help us achieve our earnings guidance in Q3 and Q4. What really changed in the forecast, since the second quarter, we did get our final property tax assessment. ",
         "We have an increase in property taxes in certainly in the latter half of the year, but we increased the gross margin for a property tax recovery associated with that for the second half of the year. Those are the two primary changes since the last time we made this adjustment.",
         "Moving on to the next page on Page 15, real quickly just point out that, from our perspective decline in gross margin, $3 million to $4 million, in line with our expectations. At the top of the page, the far right, we do show what our forecast plus the Q2 and how things actually played out, a little bit better in industrial and commercial, a little bit worse on residential and all in all, pretty much where we expected. We do show as we - maintaining our expectations for Q3 and Q4. And we show that, at a high level in the upper-right and in a more detailed basis for both our Electric and Gas business. They are directly below it ",
         "Moving forward to expenses on Page 16. Again, expenses came in line with our expectations during the second quarter. And we do show at the upper-right of full P&L associated with that. And you take into consideration the $3 million to $4 million reduction in gross margin I talked about earlier and you think about expenses, think about a net increase in operating expenses of $300,000 and then add $700,000 of interest expense. So $1 million impact on COVID on the expense side. ",
         "That gives us a pretax detriment of $4 million to $5 million and an after-tax of $3 million to $3.7 million associated with COVID or $0.06 to $0.07. One other thing I should point out on this page, we mentioned in our press release capital spending, we still anticipated approximately $400 million, we are seeing very little impacts in the supply chain. ",
         "Very little impacts on staffing levels. We are getting our work done. We\u2019ve actually spent more capital year-to-date this year than we had all of last year. So we are on great track, keep moving forward there. ",
         "And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Bob. "

         "Good day, and welcome to the NorthWestern Corporation's Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast. Today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to NorthWestern's Investor Relations Officer, Travis Meyer. Please go ahead, sir."
      ],
      "Robert Rowe": [
         "Thank you, Travis. Good afternoon everyone and thank you very much for joining. Travis included a total on the cover of the deck from the Grand Canyon of the Yellow Stone. He did that because yesterday we were in the park meeting with FERC management. We serve there on a contract basis. It\u2019s a privilege obviously to serve the nation\u2019s oldest and number one national park. ",
         "The park and the gateway communities in Montana are crowded. What\u2019s exciting about serving the park is, we do it on a contract basis we design our service to meet the customers\u2019 expectations in terms of affordability, environmental sensitivity and sustainability and reliability and at their location where we have the opportunity to try some of the exciting new distributed technologies that we are looking at. So it\u2019s a small, but important part of who we are and the area we serve. ",
         "Second quarter highlights. Net income for the second quarter decreased $26.2 million, compared to the same period last year. This was driven primarily by an income tax benefit received in 2019, by lower gross margin due to impacts of COVID-19 as we\u2019ve discussed last quarter and then by higher depreciation expenses. ",
         "These are offset impart by a decrease in operating general administrative and by some customer growth. ",
         "Diluted EPS decreased $0.51 as compared to the same period last year. Diluted non-GAAP EPS decreased $0.08 per share after adjusting for income tax benefits noted in the normal weather. The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share payable September 30 to shareholders of record as of September 15th.",
         "I will get a chance to come back and talk about customer engagement and employee health and safety as part of our COVID response in the Q&A. But we continue to be doing very, very well on both of those fronts. ",
         "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian ",
         "Thank you, Brian. Actually, just to reinforce Brian\u2019s discussion for the last three minutes in terms of margin and expense, recall, that we cannot relatively early at the end of the first quarter and certainly relatively early in the new COVID world and the ability to come in really quite closely to where we expected to be at that time with so many unknowns on expense and awful lot turning into the capital forecast, the health learning of course over on the left, we are comfortable with \u2013 about $1.8 billion of total capital over the next five years. ",
         "Financing with a combination of cash from operations with NOLs available into 2021. First mortgage bonds and equity issuances and based on what we know now, what we expect now any additional equity would be this year or early next year and it would be really focused on maintaining current credit ratings. That said, significant capital beyond what\u2019s identified in the latter to the right put us at those capital projections. "
      ],
      "The key thing, thinking about our capital forecast, first of all as exactly as Brian said, in a crazy year with potential workforce interruptions, potential supply chain interruptions and with a lot of work where they are distributed across the company, not just concentrated in one or two big projects. So an awful lot of project management to be done. We are very comfortable with we will meeting our $400 million expectation for this year. And we are equally comfortable that we\u2019ll be continuing over the next five years to invest at least that $400 million levels. You talked about before what we show as we identified projects to continue to share with our customers as we get \u2013 and be out here as this will change. We feel very, very comfortable that we\u2019ll continue to invest at the $400 million level. ": [
         "And very importantly of course, this does not include investment necessary to identify the generation capacity challenges in Montana and we are unique in being \u2013 our customers are unique and that on a good way and being exposed to the market 46% at peak out of Montana. So, this is an important investment program to continue to share by customers in the growth in our territory and we are very comfortable with all those control and everywhere else this year. We\u2019ve been able to execute and we are comfortable and we will continue to be able to execute. ",
         "Looking forward, obviously, always a lot of activity on the regulatory front. The Montana Commission approved the fixed cost recovery mechanism or decoupling. We talked about this last quarter, of course and think that very, very important over the long-term, it\u2019s effective \u2013 most of the effective July 1. As we discussed last quarter, we did requested that the implementation date we deferred until July 1 of next year for COVID-related concerns definition agreed with that, that have made sense - delayed the implementation by a year, but didn\u2019t request instruct that we are providing \u2013 kind of a shadow accounting for the Commission to really understand what the impacts of the FCRM would have been if it have been implemented July of this year. ",
         "In June of course, we obviously been ordered from the FERC accepting our Montana transmission filing guiding interim rates, setting a procedural schedule and ultimately even appointing and administering the law judge settlement negotiations continue to be ongoing despite the challenges of COVID obviously are being - not meeting in person. ",
         "And then we would expect a compliance filing with the Montana Commission when an early FERC rate case does conclude. As you know, concerning our post with application Talen did assert, it\u2019s right at first refusal. So we are in the process of modifying that application to reflect a 92.5 megawatt acquisition from Puget Sound Energy and then the corresponding purchase power agreement to sell power back to Puget Sound Energy within that proceeds then propose to be satisfy to cover eventual closing costs for our current ownership goals. So, that\u2019s a compelling proposition from a customer perspective and also from our net company and from an environmental perspective. ",
         "On the South Dakota front, we are underway, again despite the COVID challenges this 60 megawatts flexible value with $80 million of flexible capacity located in Iran. This site will be activated here within a matter of days. And that should be online by late 2021. Just identical, we\u2019ve filed now a new South Dakota higher feed in the last couple of weeks. Very great feedback from both the staff and in the Commission and received word from the Commission Chair that our 57 page summary document of the best plan we had ever seen. So we really appreciate that and that plan is consistent with the plan that we are currently implementing really focused on removing our fleet being able to provide our customers reliability to get the full benefits and participate in the Southwest power pool. ",
         "In Montana of course, we issued an all source solicitation for up to 280 megawatts of flexible capacity. That went out in February. We are using a third-party administrator. We are, of course, participating with \u2013 ourselves and looking forward to seeing the outcome of that. The projects of course, at this point are identity blind in terms of who is sponsoring the project. ",
         "So, that\u2019s about all we can say there, again, other than we have participated in the project and look forward to seeing the results. We are also on track to join the Western Energy imbalance market in April of 2021 and this could certainly provide benefits for our Montana customers and much more efficient utilization of both supply and transmission assets. ",
         "But as we talked about you have to bring your own toys to the sandbox. We need resources in order to participate. Worth noting there that last week, the Montana Commission had great discussion of regional resource adequacy. Frank Afranji, who was the President of the Northwest Power Pool was the lead presenter describing the immediate concerns of the entire region has in terms of being able to meet our customers\u2019 needs. "
      ],
      "The need for coordinated approaches to do that and then we had our leaders on the \u2013 on both the supply and transmission side speak, as well. And again, the region is facing a very, very critical situation and within the region being 46% exposed. Our customers truly, truly are the most at risk. ": [
         "So, with that, I look forward to questions. "

But we also expected to kind of pull off the gas a little bit on OG&A savings in the second half of the year either and if in fact things continue to stay difficult with the COVID on the margins side, we will be that much attune to it on the OG&A expense.

And so, if we had expectation on OG&A cuts for the full year, we would be backing off that a little bit as well. So, you noticed that quite early, we had $0.14 of improvement on a year-over-year basis on the OG&A line just in the second quarter alone. And obviously, the range for Q3 and Q4 is less than that. And so, if in fact, my point was, if in fact we don\u2019t see the margin improvement in which we do expect that we will get that. That we will need to do more on the OG&A side, but feel confident that we could. "

So that\u2019s the biggest driver from a margin perspective. But we are \u2013 from our perspective, we are seeing \u2013 we\u2019ll expect to see better irrigation. We are going to obviously have customer growth and I mentioned earlier that we expected some \u2013 in the first quarter we mentioned some unbilled timing associated in the second half of the year. So, again \u2013 but, in looking just at this page, you can see that the primary benefit, $0.09 of that gross margin is associated with property tax. So, you really need $0.02 to $0.08 of the remainder and we feel very good about that. ",

Second thing I\u2019d point out, in our two states, our two largest states, Montana and South Dakota the total number of COVID cases in those two states combined, is about approximately 2200.

Did you say that would be before adding any potential Montana generation additions or like, in other words, Montana generation would be incremental to that $400 million per year? "

And very, very positive and probably deferred in \u2013 might have been the case just a couple of years ago. And again, the conversations that the commission had with \u2013 for the end of NorthWest Power pool, just last week did indicate a real appreciation for the situation that customers in Montana face.

That doesn\u2019t overly concern you given the overarching being that they recognize a short and everything like \u2013 just kind of seem like that the thought that I guess, it had to be natural gas to fulfill the person potential to other types of resources to maybe meet the need effectively as well.

            "The way I look at the plan is the key is the plan identified a need. Subsequently then there were a whole range of scenarios using different resource combinations and those scenarios were just that that when we made the decision not to identify a specific preferred resource in the plan, and then, commit to the path to let essentially all resources compete. That\u2019s a very different direction. Now, couple of comments that are interesting. ",

The environments in the two states are in many ways quite different, obviously, but the same kind of analysis in what we\u2019ve received back in South Dakota was real support for the plan. ",
            "I would certainly think that our plan grew in Montana over time will continue to address and you\u2019ll find the Montana plan to speak to the concerns if there are questions that were raised by the consultants to the commission which is really the source for many of the comments. ",

We should see some real diversity and the viability \u2013 cost-effective viability if there is technology that is going to be proven in what\u2019s submitted. "

            "Jonathan, I wanted add just a clarification, I think on the capital plan. The capital plan we are showing on Page 17 is our capital plan for the year. Obviously, as we go through the process and go through our budgeting process, in the outer years, they typically tend to be a bit higher than we had originally planned. So, if there is an expectation as Bob points out, that we are going to be close to 400. I think we should be guaranteeing anybody that there will be 400 out there as outer years. I would say this though, if in fact, we are doing any Montana generation, we are likely to be at, at least 400 if not likely higher. If that\u2019s helpful clarification. "
