         "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, let me remind everyone that all figures discussed today are stated in U.S. dollars. Total investment properties revenue for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2020 increased 56.1% and 43.4% over last year, primarily due to 2019 and 2020 acquisitions with additional contributions from increased base rent. The REIT also earned management fee revenue of approximately 96,000 and 369,000 in the quarter and year-to-date, respectively.",
         "Net operating income for the 3 and 6 months was up 51.2% and 40.9% from last year, and same properties NOI was up 0.1% and 0.8% for the 3 and 6 months, driven mainly by favorable re-leasing spreads and contractual rent increases, partially offset by a 1.2% and 1.1% reduction in same property occupancy, respectively.",
         "G&A expenses for the 3 and 6 months, excluding any fair value adjustments, were approximately 2.9 million and $3.6 million, up 5.2% and 8.2% over last year, while the portfolio has more than doubled since the start of 2019.",
         "AFFO and FFO for the quarter were up 34.2% and 36.6%, respectively. FFO and AFFO per unit were 20.0 cents per unit and 15.3 cents per unit, respectively. Excluding a 3.1 cents per unit impact from $2.7 million in onetime costs related to the debt prepayment, FFO and AFFO per unit would have been up 8.5% and 14.3%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2019. Both FFO and AFFO mainly impact -- were mainly impacted by increased properties revenue due to acquisitions, increases in base rent by a reduction in general and administrative expenses from the prior period. They were also impacted by a 37.2% increase in the weighted average number of units outstanding compared to the same period last year and a reduction in occupancy.",
         "Our ACFO payout ratio for the quarter was 105.9% compared to 98.9% in the same period last year. The ACFO payout ratio was directly affected by the prepayment costs. And excluding those, the ACFO payout ratio for the quarter would have been 89.9%.",
         "At June 30, 2020, our balance sheet and liquidity position remains strong with cash on hand of $20.2 million and remaining availability on the credit facility of approximately $200.7 million.",
         "During the quarter, the REIT also completed the following notable transactions. On May 21, 2020, the REIT acquired a land parcel located in Nashville, Tennessee for a purchase price of $6.5 million, exclusive of closing and transaction costs. The REIT is in the process of contributing this property into a development joint venture with one or more private capital partners to build approximately 726,000 square feet of modern distribution logistics space on the site.",
         "On June 26, 2020, the REIT repaid 6 secured mortgages being a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% with an aggregate remaining principal balance of $97.6 million. The repayment was funded with funds from the unsecured revolving credit facility at an interest rate of 1.8%. As a result of the repayments of these mortgages, the rate incurred prepayment cost of $2.7 million, an increased credit facility availability by $15 million. I'll now turn things over to Matt to provide an operations update."

      "Matt Cimino": [
         "Thanks, Judd, and good morning, everyone. Similar to last quarter, I'll start with some updated rent collection numbers and then turn to quarterly leasing and private capital activity.",
         "To date, we've received 99.5% of contractual rents for July and over 82% of contractual rents for August, which is in line with our collections percentage during the second quarter at similar points of the month. While the REIT did not agree to any rent deferral arrangements during the second quarter, the REIT currently expects to agree to a short-term deferral arrangement with one tenant totaling approximately $70,000, which represents approximately 0.04% of annualized portfolio gross rent. All deferred rent is expected to be collected by January 1, 2021.",
         "Turning to leasing activity. The REIT had 539,000 square feet of new leases and 1,122,000 square feet of lease renewals commenced in the second quarter. Lease renewals commencing in the quarter had a weighted average cash re-leasing spread and straight-line rent re-leasing spread of 8.3% and 8.2%, respectively. We also signed 779,000 square feet of lease renewals in the second quarter, with a weighted average cash re-leasing spread and straight-line rent re-leasing spread of 11.3% and 6.6%, respectively.",
         "As of June 30, 2020, the REIT had approximately 359,000 square feet, or 1.1% of the portfolio's gross leasable area, set to expire in 2020 and approximately 2.2 million square feet, or 6.9% of the portfolio gross leasable area, set to expire in 2021, the majority of which is set to expire in the second half of the year. The REIT into the quarter was occupancy of 97.4% and a portfolio weighted average remaining lease term of 4.6 years.",
         "Within our private capital pipeline, the REIT has projects at various stages in the development process, totaling approximately 3.9 million square feet. We have a two building project in PAO, New Jersey, with one building 100% leased to a single-tenant and the second building in lease-up. We have two other buildings, one in the Inland Empire market and one in the Cincinnati market that have recently wrapped up construction and are also being marketed for lease.",
         "And we have five buildings in preconstruction or construction in the Minneapolis, Chicago, Houston, Nashville, and recently Mansfield, New Jersey markets.During the quarter, the REIT also entered into a new partnership with the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario to provide additional joint venture capital for our growing industrial value-add and development pipeline.",
         "The REIT expects to invest alongside IMCO and other private capital partners and future value-add and development investments in select U.S. distribution and logistics markets. In addition to our ongoing development activity, we have also turned our focus to capital recycling, as we look to dispose of properties that are no longer core to our future growth.",
         "Despite a brief delay in our 2020 capital recycling plans related to market uncertainty, as the investment sales market begins to stabilize, we expect to ramp up capital recycling in the second half of 2020 and 2021.And with that, I'll now turn things back to Scott to wrap up."

         "Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to WPT Industrial REIT's Second Quarter 2020 Investor Conference Call. ",
         "Before we begin, let me remind everyone that during this conference call, management may make statements containing forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is based on a number of assumptions and is subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those disclosed or implied. We direct you to the Company's earnings release, MD&A, and other securities filings for additional information about these assumptions, risks, and uncertainties.",
         "I would now like to turn the conference meeting over to Mr. Scott Frederiksen, Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Frederiksen, the floor is yours, sir."

      "Scott Frederiksen": [
         "Today are Judd Gilats, the REIT's CFO, and Matt Cimino, the REIT's COO. Before discussing our second quarter results, I wanted to provide a few comments on the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to last quarter, I'm pleased to report that the COVID-19 so far continues to have a minimal impact on our results. And over the medium to long term, we still believe the industrial sector will benefit from some of the changes brought on or accelerated by the pandemic, including increased inventory levels and accelerated adoption of e-commerce.",
         "In the near term, we remain focused on keeping our team of employees safe and ensuring our tenants have safe and continuous access to our buildings. John and Matt will provide a bit more context on what we're seeing as it relates to rent collections and tenant referral requests shortly.",
         "From an operational standpoint, we continue to grow net operating income in large part due to our 2019 and 2020 acquisition activity. Notwithstanding the ongoing pandemic, we continue to see favorable re-leasing spreads, which Matt will highlight later, and we were able to finish the quarter with occupancy ticking up to approximately 97.4%.",
         "Looking at the remainder of the year, we've taken the additional steps to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position, including proactively refinancing $98 million of debt during the second quarter. Although our prepayment expenses from this refinancing activity created a onetime drag on our quarterly earnings, these refinancings reduced our interest expense and provided us with an additional $50 million of liquidity.",
         "With minimal lease renewals and no debt maturities for the next 12 months and expanded access to private capital resources, we believe we're well positioned to withstand the current period of economic uncertainty and capitalize on future growth opportunities.",
         "With that, I'll now turn things over to Judd to discuss the REIT's financial results in more detail. Judd?",
         "Thanks, Matt. In closing, I want to extend my thanks to our dedicated team of employees who continue to proactively manage our portfolio and source compelling new investments in private capital relationships for the REIT throughout these challenging and uncertain times. While there's still no shortage of uncertainty in the current market, we remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for the U.S. industrial real estate sector.",
         "Thanks for your time and attention this morning. Hope you're all staying safe and healthy. We'd now be pleased to answer any questions you may have."

Maybe just first in the quarter, the amount of fees that were generated kind of ticked down sequentially. Just wondering if you can provide us with an update on what you're expecting for fee generation for the balance of the year?"

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, Chris. We continue to expect the balance of the year to -- for the full year to be in the range that we've previously given $2.5 million to $4.5 million. Some of those fees are a little bit episodic with the construction management fees. And with some of the new assets we're contributing into joint ventures, we were comfortable with our previous guidance."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. We're not going to comment on specific allocations in terms of the investors. But I mean, I think the relationship was established in the same way we've established our previous relationships. And I think our objectives on private capital have really remained the same. I mean we've, first and foremost, sought to create a proprietary pipeline for the REIT and make sure that we've maintained the right of first opportunity over everything that we develop, and that continues to remain the case, and that was something that IMCO embraced along with our other partners. And so that was an important factor in facilitating that relationship.",
            "And then, secondly, we're trying to grow and diversify our pipeline of opportunities, and that includes adding sourcing capabilities, which I know you've heard us talk about on prior calls with boots on the ground now in New Jersey and California. And then -- and pairing that with expanding and diversifying our capital resources. So the addition of this relationship was really just in furtherance of those same objectives. And we think big picture, this gives us the opportunity to expand that pipeline and make sure that in any case, we've always got a source of capital to match fund any opportunity that we're interested in pursuing."

         "Remarks": [
            "So just to follow-up on the land transactions, one in Nashville and one in New Jersey. So are there more opportunities on the land pricing right now than the stabilized income producing properties? And have you seen any changes in the land values in the key markets in the recent time?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Himanshu Gupta"
      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So I'd say this, Himanshu, that early COVID, we weren't seeing a lot of stabilized assets being marketed. And then, kind of midway through COVID, the first few things we saw were -- resembled long-term leases to companies like Amazon and a locations. And when those cleared at pre-COVID pricing, the market thawed a little further, and then we began to see household name assets in maybe Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets clear and again, maintain pre-COVID pricing levels. And so now we're seeing quite a few stabilized opportunities of different tenancies in different markets. But look, our focus, as we've said, in the short term, is going to be to ramp up on the private capital side and we still think that's a good risk reward proposition for us.",
            "And on that second part of your question -- in the gateway markets and in some of the higher barrier markets, land prices haven't budged. And we've seen very little movement in some of the Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets as well. I'd say the change has been that a lot of the developers or folks that were thinking about building speculative have tapped the brakes on that. And so maybe there's created an opportunity to be the buyer or to source the site where previous to COVID, that would have been tied up by someone else.",
            "And so it's opened up more opportunities, but it hasn't really resulted in lower prices."

      },
      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So going forward, it will be the same differentiation that we've had in the past, which is that we'll look to capitalize value-add and development investments with private capital, and we will present those opportunities to our partners, first and foremost, before we would pursue them directly in the REIT. And then, anything that stabilized is typically going to be pursued directly by the REIT. Obviously, we can mix and match at our discretion there, but that's the general objective."

         "Speaker": "Himanshu Gupta"
      },
      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "No. It's a diversified mix of markets. Again, I think it's entirely consistent with what we've been up to with private capital, generally. And I think they are supportive and believe, generally speaking, in the U.S. industrial sector in the markets that we would typically be sourcing investments in, I think, are generally all markets that they're interested in being in it. So I think the intention is to invest across a diversified set of markets, not dissimilar from our other partners."

      },
      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. Okay. And then, just turning on the leasing side, at the Plainfield property, what is the new rent on a dollar per foot basis? And are the annual escalators similar to what you would have done pre-COVID? And just wondering, it was still one year out. The X5 was still one year out. Did the tenant approach you? Or was it more of a proactive lease extension?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Himanshu Gupta"
      },
      "18": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So I'd say this, what haven't seen rents fall as a result of COVID. The way we're underwriting rents today, and I think consistent with others in the market, we've changed our underwriting to be basically an assumption that rents stay flat over the short-term. And the short-term might be the rest of '20 and '21, where historically, we would be growing those rents as we model with inflation. And so I think there's been a, I'll call it, a pause in the market.",
            "Now a lot of the market statistics you see from CB and the likes have said that rents have continued to rise, especially in the gateway markets. But -- and I think that mirrors our experience as well. So depending on where you're talking about rents have either continued to rise, maybe at a slightly slower pace or flattened, but I don't know of any market or tenant specific situation where rents have wildly reversed the other direction. And typically, I'm not sure, we don't get into talking about specific tenants and specific per square foot rents."

      },
      "19": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. And maybe just final question from me. Again, on the leasing. For the prior years portfolio, that was bought with a couple of vacancies, I think in Atlanta and Dallas. Any progress here on the leasing?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Himanshu Gupta"
      },
      "20": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So when we put that property under -- when we put the portfolio under contract, actually, the vacancy in Atlanta was 800,000. And the good news is, while we were in due diligence, we were successful in leasing 500,000 feet of that 800,000 square foot building. So still a little bit of work left to do, but we did knock off a big chunk of it while we were in our due diligence period.",
            "But look, the vacancy that remains in Atlanta and the 200,000 square foot vacancy in South Dallas are both first generation, state of the art distribution space, and we're confident that we can lease those long term. And that's really how we get from that going-in cap rate that we quoted when we bought Firetti for the stabilized cap rate that we quoted.",
            "The other piece that I'll call it would be whipped cream on top would be the 85 acres in South Dallas, where you can basically support a 1.4 million square foot distribution center. And we're marketing that today for build-to-suits. Our intention isn't to go spec on that, but we've had a couple of I'll call it hints of activity there. So that wasn't in our base underwriting and really would be kind of an additional piece of value-add that we hadn't planned on."

But look, there's still product being developed, a lot of which, I mean, probably a third of the product being developed today is pre-leased or build-to-suit space. And so that will continue.",
            "And then, as I mentioned earlier, several people, because of COVID or because of the construction lending market have either delayed or canceled some new spec developments, and some of that will resume once people feel good about where the market is headed. And there's a lot of leasing velocity out there. I mean, just anecdotally, there's -- Amazon's gobbling up space across the country, and there's a lot of demand in many of the markets. And so it's just a question of time before some of that stuff gets put back into production."

And we're in discussions with all our e-commerce companies right now.

Now having said that there are certainly assets that we have in a market where we own one asset or we never intended on being in, but may be purchased it as part of a portfolio, and we'd look to lighten up in those areas where we own assets outside of our target markets. But it could be a building that a tenant falls in love with and wants to own and is willing to pay more than we think the building is worth. It could be a vacant building where we marketed both for sale or for lease and find a buyer before we find a tenant. It's a mixed bag."

Look, we -- we're 50% levered today, but we don't feel like operating this portfolio with this tenancy, where you're collecting 99.5% of the rent is irresponsible in any way. And a lot of private capital buyers would lever this 60 or 70% and not give a second thought to it. So we're not in a panic to get the leverage back down, although it's clearly our plan over time.

I know you guys bought some of the stabilized assets in the private capital pipeline in the third quarter of last year. But the fee revenue, excluding promotes, does look like it continues to go down and I think this quarter would certainly be a low watermark. I was wondering if you could just give a little bit of color behind what's driving that. And given that you haven't acquired anything out of the private capital pipeline since the third quarter. And how should we think about the evolution of that line through the back half of this year?"

I think we've already talked about the second part of your question where we do continue to expect that fee revenue for the year will be somewhere in the 2.5 to $4.5 million range like we've talked about previously. The -- for Q2, remember, the management fees, excluding the promotes, are made up of asset management fees and construction management fees. Some of those construction management fees have to do with the timing of where we're at in the development of an individual asset. And so those will ebb and flow as -- when we're heavy into the development phase, we're putting shovels in the ground and putting up walls. So those numbers will be higher. And when the buildings are complete, those numbers tail off.",

But given the way our feed structures work, if the -- if an asset is sold more quickly, obviously, we get a bigger promote, then we get less ongoing revenue from the management fees. So our assumption is that some of that is promote, but it will depend on the timing and execution on leasing on some of these assets that are -- where construction is complete and we're working on leasing now in terms of when those stabilize and then are sold."

I mean, I would say, in most cases, those requests came early in the pandemic at a point where I think there was significantly more uncertainty for everyone, including our tenants. And so those came in the form of boiler plate requests that went out early and have really never been followed up on. And in most instances, I think we've talked about in the past that, our standard response typically includes an application process where you fill out some request forms, and we get a sense of the basis for the need. And in most cases, people didn't even bother to fill out those applications, and we've heard nothing from them since.",
            "And so I think we're more focused on the rent collection numbers that gives us 3 or 4 months of data to suggest that that gives us a better proxy into where people are. But -- so there's some uncertainty there. And clearly, there are some tenants that are still under some pressure in their respective businesses or industries. So we're keeping an eye on things. But yes, I don't think that we're circling back to that, and we're not -- we're certainly not seeing people re request every month. Most of those have been a one-off request that has laid dormant since it was made."
