      "David D. Clark - Synchronoss Technologies, Inc.": [
         "Thanks, Glenn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'll review our second quarter results.",
         "Revenue for the quarter was $76.5 million, down slightly compared to $77.8 million in year-ago quarter as increases in cloud, messaging revenue were offset by a decrease in digital revenue due to the new operating agreement with STI and the sun-setting of our Universal ID products.",
         "For the six months ended June 30, 2020, revenue was $154.1 million compared to $166 million in the first six months of 2019, again driven by a decrease in digital revenue. Our recurring revenue was 78.4% of total revenue in the second quarter compared with 72% in the first quarter and 80% in the second quarter a year ago.",
         "As we noted at Investor Day, approximately 85% of our revenue is under multiyear contracts, which provides strong foundation and base of revenue that has served us well in the COVID-19 economy. Cloud revenue was $42.4 million in the second quarter, a 5% increase compared to $40.4 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by additional subscriber and professional services revenues.",
         "A note on the Verizon renewal. Due to the extension of the contract, approximately $10 million of deferred revenue was on our balance sheet on the renewal date and would have been amortized over the remaining quarters in 2020 will now be amortized over the new term of the contract. While this reduced recognition of non-cash deferred revenue in 2020 by approximately $5 million per quarter or $10 million for the balance of the year, it will also result in a more cohesive match between EBITDA and free cash flow generation in the future on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Quarterly recognition of non-cash deferred revenue is expected to be negligible going forward.",
         "Messaging revenue was $19.1 million in the second quarter compared to $15.2 million in the year-ago quarter, a 25.7% increase, largely driven by the continued success in Japan and additional revenue from the work with the CCMI joint venture.",
         "Digital revenue was $15 million in the quarter compared to $22.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was due to lower revenue from STI under the new operating agreement compared to the agreement that was in place last year and the sun-setting of our Universal ID product.",
         "I'll now discuss profitability metrics. Total costs and expenses were $88 million in the second quarter, down 8.4% compared to $96.1 million in last year's second quarter. For the six month, total costs and expenses were $182.4 million and that's down 10.9% compared to $204.6 million in the first six of 2019.",
         "For both the three-month and the six-month period, the change was largely driven by lower cost of goods sold and lower depreciation, which in turn related to our migration from company-owned data centers to the cloud. These were offset by higher restructuring charges in the current period.",
         "The reduction in total costs and expenses reflects the cost reduction initiatives we executed in 2020 that are delivering the expected results. As noted in the prior earnings call and at Investor Day, in total, we have targeted a reduction of $55 million in annual operating cost from our expense base, of which we expect to realize approximately $45 million of savings in 2020.",
         "Adjusted gross profit in the second quarter was $47.9 million compared to $45.1 million in last year's second quarter. Adjusted gross margin in the second quarter was 62.6% compared to 57.9% in last year's second quarter. The second quarter improvement in gross profit and gross margin was due to better cost management in this year's period.",
         "For the six months ended June 30, 2020, gross profit was $90.4 million compared to $94.9 million in the first six months of 2019. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, adjusted gross profit was 58.8% compared to 57.2% in the first six months 2019. The decrease in the six-month period primarily resulted from a decrease in digital revenue, the new operating with STI, and the sun-setting of our Universal ID product.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $11.5 million compared to $8.7 million in last year's second quarter, and this was largely driven by execution of cost reductions. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15%, well in the double digits, up from 11.1% in last year's second quarter. And this is our highest EBITDA margin since Q4 of 2018.",
         "Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, liquidity at the end of the quarter, which is primarily cash and marketable securities, totaled $42.8 million. Note that our $10 million line of credit from Citizens Bank remains fully drawn at the end of the second quarter and is included in this balance.",
         "We generated $13 million of cash in the quarter. After the quarter-end, the utilization of the CARES Act provision provided liquidity, which enables \u2013 under the provision that enables companies to carry back net operating loss from the tax years of 2018, 2019, and 2020. Accordingly, after quarter-end, in mid-July, we received approximately a $10 million refund in taxes paid in 2016, which further bolstered our liquidity.",
         "We feel very good about our liquidity throughout 2020. And, as Glenn discussed, we've taken several actions to conserve cash in-year, and our business plan is calibrated to ensure there was sufficient liquidity throughout the year.",
         "Refinancing our preferred stock and positioning the company with a cost-effective permanent capital structure is a top priority for Synchronoss. We're actively evaluating financing alternatives and we believe it is essential that we are positioned to move quickly when markets move our way.",
         "In connection with that objective, we expect to file a universal shelf in conjunction with our 10-Q later this month, which enables us to quickly access public markets when it is prudent. The shelf filing will not mean financing is at all imminent, but rather repositioning ourselves to move quickly at some point in the future.",
         "On our last call, we maintained our original adjusted EBITDA guidance of $25 million to $35 million for the year. As I noted earlier, the Verizon renewal removes approximately $10 million of non-cash deferred revenue from the latter half of this year. Under ASC 606 accounting rules, this remaining $10 million of deferred revenue will now be amortized over the new term of the contract. The implied adjusted EBITDA range would be $15 million to $25 million.",
         "However, we are narrowing the range of the top half of the range. Accordingly, we are now expecting adjusted EBITDA for the year of $20 million to $25 million. Again, I want to reiterate the only reason for the change in EBITDA guidance is due to the amortization of the $10 million of non-cash deferred revenue over the life of the new contract, instead of over the next two quarters.",
         "Before we open Q&A, I want to mention that Joe Crivelli, who has served as our Vice President-Investor Relations since December of 2018, will be leaving the company on August 14. Joe will remain part of the Synchronoss team in a consulting capacity and will assist Leslie Gahagan, who will take over the day-to-day responsibility for Investor Relations as an Investor Relations Analyst. Joe and I have collaborated for quite a long time and I want to thank Joe for his contributions over the past year and a half and wish him well in the future.",
         "I will now turn it back over to Glenn."

      "Glenn Lurie - Synchronoss Technologies, Inc.": [
         "Thanks, Leslie, and thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. It's a big day for Synchronoss and a busy morning. Earlier this morning, we announced the renewal of a Verizon contract for an additional five years as well as earnings for the second quarter. I'll cover earnings first.",
         "As you can see, we continue to build on a momentum from the start of the year despite the most challenging economic environment of the last two decades. As COVID-19 continues to disrupt the economy, we delivered revenue of $76.5 million, an adjusted EBITDA of $11.5 million as well as $13 million in adjusted free cash flow, which all exceeded internal and external expectations.",
         "The robust EBITDA result brings us back to a double-digit EBITDA margin and reflects the prudent cost cutting we executed before and after the pandemic struck. Furthermore, liquidity continued to build and topped $42.8 million at the end of the quarter, up from $31 million at the end of the first quarter.",
         "Based on these financial results, it is clear that Synchronoss was able to perform and execute well during the quarter. We are responsibly navigating through the pandemic to maintain overall company health for the short and long term. The last two quarters are a testament to the diligence of the entire Synchronoss team, which had to adapt, evolve, and adjust to a work-from-home environment.",
         "Most of us have been working from home for over five months now as most of our offices remain closed. Despite this continued global challenge, we've been able to close and deliver new deals, source new business, and move the ball forward with customers and prospects alike.",
         "I want to give a shout-out to our technology team headed by our CTO, Pat Doran, which reacted quickly when COVID-19 first became an issue and made sure we had best-in-class business tools to maintain our business momentum and help our more than 1,500 employees transition to the new paradigm and remain productive. It is their hard work that has helped set the stage for the strong second quarter results we are discussing today.",
         "In addition, the execution of our cost reduction initiatives has gone well. We are on track to achieve the $45 million in-year cost savings and $55 million annualized cost savings we announced earlier this year. David will provide more commentary on this when he discusses our financials.",
         "I'd like to take a few moments now to discuss some key commercial activity in the quarter. I'm incredibly proud of the customer wins our sales team headed by our CCO, Jeff Miller, was able to achieve in the second quarter. This team has truly risen to the occasion to find new ways to reach customers despite a virtual work environment and critical industry events being canceled.",
         "Let me start with cloud. Now, let's turn to the Verizon deal. We secured a new commercial agreement with Verizon, including a five-year extension to our long-standing personal cloud relationship at substantially similar structure and financial terms to our previous cloud agreement. This is great for Synchronoss and its shareholders long term because of the increased certainty and stability.",
         "This new contract extension with our largest customer also demonstrates Verizon's commitment to the Verizon Cloud and to Synchronoss. This extension further solidifies our relationship with Verizon and shows the value they and their subscribers see in our Personal Cloud Platform, which delivers solid incremental revenue and profits for Verizon, and a better user experience for their subscribers.",
         "Another important component of our extension with Verizon is a joint marketing agreement to step up our marketing efforts to sell Verizon Cloud to their wireless subscriber base. We have not previously had, to this degree, a dedicated and coordinated direct marketing effort to Verizon's existing wireless customers.",
         "To-date, we are predominantly focused on the cloud adoption in the setup flow when Verizon is onboarding a new customer or an existing customer upgrade to their device. We believe this joint marketing effort will be powerful catalyst to drive adoption of Verizon Cloud, and deliver incremental growth and revenue for both us and Verizon as we move forward.",
         "We also expanded our relationship by securing additional cloud initiatives in the quarter that will augment Verizon's service offerings in other areas, which provides us with expanded access to Verizon customers and help us continue to grow cloud revenue. We will share additional details regarding these new initiatives as they are launched to the marketplace.",
         "Verizon Cloud's subscriber performance continued to grow during the quarter and is ahead of our business plan objectives and projections. Also, we delivered a family cloud enhancement offering that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance the customer experience for Verizon subscribers during the quarter.",
         "So, to recap the developments with the Verizon relationship, we have extended our relationship with our largest and long-standing cloud customer. We are organically growing our collective subscriber base platform in the setup flow when new customers switch to Verizon or existing customers upgrade their devices. A new joint marketing agreement will enable us to intensify the marketing of our services to a broader Verizon customer base and have added new bundles with the potential to add even more Verizon Cloud subscribers.",
         "We are jointly developing and launching new product enhancements that will increase the value proposition for their customers. And we are working with Verizon on new cloud initiatives that will expand our access to Verizon customers beyond what we have today. We have always had a strong relationship with Verizon, but if there was ever a question about these facts, those developments should be put to bed once and for all.",
         "With this renewal, over the past 18 months, we have now renewed four of our legacy cloud customers with multiyear agreements: Verizon, BT \u2013 British Telecom, SFR, and Proximus. During that period, we've also launched three new customers in AT&T, TracFone and Assurant. Again, we feel this demonstrates the outstanding value proposition our white label personal cloud offering provides to our customers and to their subscribers.",
         "I want to highlight our progress with AT&T's Personal Cloud launch and provide an update on where we stand. Since during our Investor Day in June, we shared that the COVID-19 had delayed our cloud-related initiatives with Verizon. Starting earlier this quarter, AT&T announced a growing list of Android devices that are being preloaded with the Synchronoss Out of Box Experience, or OOBE, with the cloud embedded. OOBE offers an enhanced device setup flow for customers and, as you've heard us talk about, has been proven successful for driving cloud adoption, as seen with our other carrier customers globally. Now, every new and upgrade Android subscriber will go through the OOBE flow at AT&T.",
         "Regarding TracFone, we started with SIMPLE Mobile and are now preparing for the launch of the next set of brands within the TracFone family for Personal Cloud. Following our launch of Spectrum Mobile with Assurant, we have now launched a second brand with our cloud integration to their Pocket Geek application during the second quarter with two more cloud customers to follow.",
         "Across our Personal Cloud customers, we're launching targeted campaigns to their existing base of customers and new acquisitions, plus using new digital and social tools to highlight the customer experience and benefits of digitally protecting their assets on broadband and mobile devices.",
         "Turning to messaging, the work on our Advanced Messaging solution with CCMI joint venture of AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon continues to move forward. During the quarter, we won two additional contracts with CCMI, totaling mid-seven figures.",
         "An example of our momentum in Japan during the quarter, the top financial institutions in Japan selected the RCS-based +Message service provided by Synchronoss to enable a common user interface for safe and secure transactions. The service called Airpost provides a digital transformation to enhance the experience, value, and efficiency for customers.",
         "Participating companies include Mitsubishi UFJ Bank, Musashino Bank, JCB, and Tokio Marine Nichido (sic) [Tokio Marine & Nichido]. More than 30 additional major companies are also investigating this application. This bodes well that the advent of A2P advanced messaging is here and that this new revenue source may be nearing an inflection point where we believe we can grow into a material new revenue stream for Synchronoss for years to come.",
         "We're also seeing continued good traction and additional Advanced Messaging pursuits, and are actively engaged in proposals with global telecom providers in APAC and EMEA for multiple new opportunities. We believe our status as the only company that has launched advanced messaging and the provider of advancements in technology in both Japan and the US will be one of those things that differentiates us in these pursuits.",
         "Turning to Core Messaging e-mail platform, during the quarter, we won a competitive battle for e-mail expansion with Proximus. This was a very nice win for our highly profitable legacy e-mail business.",
         "Moving to digital, the financial pressures of COVID-19 have presented continued opportunities to our Digital Access Management portfolio with most multiple recent new customer sales and the onboarding of customers to our integrated financial analytics, iNOW, and new spatial cloud offerings. These include a seven-figure financial analytics SaaS agreement with a nationwide service provider and a spatial management contract with Globe Telecom in the Philippines.",
         "We also executed a five-year contract extension with Sage Management, who is our partner providing audit services to our financial analytics customer base. We believe this commercial agreement will continue to contribute millions of dollars of revenue to our digital business unit per year and continue to add value to our financial analytics customers.",
         "Through our continued work with Wireless Advocates, we delivered the DXP Care Activation Accelerator Pack (12:45) in the second quarter, which enables the integration and management for third-party companies to sell activations for AT&T and Verizon, with T-Mobile expected to follow later this year.",
         "A quick update on Sequential Technologies or STI. Under the new leadership team, STI quickly completed its minority business enterprise certification, which we believe will lead to new Fortune 500 opportunities and future growth for both STI and Synchronoss.",
         "Turning to IoT. While access to physical customer locations due to the pandemic slowed some of our customer deployments, our Smart Buildings solutions are receiving increased interest from businesses as they prepare to return to work.",
         "As a result of COVID-19, every building owner and operator will be looking to understand real-time wellness and health information of their building. We plan to leverage our Smart Buildings platform, which already provides the visibility and control to a broad array of sensor technologies by exploring pathogen remediation solutions for inclusion in our offering.",
         "During the quarter, we enhanced our Smart Buildings solutions with the new technician application to further expediate the integration process for these sensors and providing visibility to those insights through our dashboards. We're also making steady progress in a number of multisite deployment opportunities, which we expect to communicate during the second half of the year.",
         "In conclusion, we are very happy with and very proud of our second quarter results, the team's execution and our ability during the quarter to overcome the extremely challenging COVID-19 economy and environment and delivering strong financial results. We renewed our largest customer to a five-year deal, won new deals, and set the stage for short- and long-term growth in each of our business platforms.",
         "And we delivered positive free cash flow of $13 million, built on our cash and liquidity to $42.8 million, and ensure that we have sufficient cash to execute on our business objectives, all while we continue on the target to reduce costs by $45 million in-year and $55 million on a annualized basis. This is a great accomplishment on the part of the entire Synchronoss team, and I thank every one of our employees for their role in making it happen.",
         "With that, David will provide additional financial details. David?",
         "Thank you, David. Before we open for questions, I want to recap everything we just discussed with these critical points.",
         "First, we are incredibly proud of our team for delivering revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow that exceeded internal and external expectations. Our prudent cost-cutting initiatives and execution drove a robust double-digit EBITDA margin. We have demonstrated the strength of our long-term customer relationships with multiple renewals and with the closing of several important new deals.",
         "We are obviously very excited about our five-year contract extension with Verizon. This renewal should give each of our (23:56) shareholders comfort about our long-term stability and predictability of our revenue base. If you have not seen this morning's press release related to this announcement, please visit our website for more information.",
         "Along with the renewal, we have expanded our relationship with Verizon, which in turn expands access to Verizon customer base. We have secured a joint marketing agreement, and we believe we'll accelerate growth and cloud revenue.",
         "At the same time, we are moving to a new stage of deployment with AT&T cloud and we believe that having the cloud embedded in the OOBE device flow, our new Android devices will enable revenue from AT&T to begin to accelerate as well. All of this, along with strong second quarter results, represents good news for the company and our shareholders.",
         "With that, I will now open for questions. Leslie, do we have anybody in the queue?"
      ],
      "Leslie Gahagan - Synchronoss Technologies, Inc.": [
         "Good morning, everyone. I am Leslie Gahagan, Investor Relations Analyst for Synchronoss Technologies. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.",
         "Joining me here is Synchronoss' President and CEO, Glenn Lurie; David Clark, our Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Crivelli, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.",
         "During today's call, we will make statements about expectations for the second half of 2020 and beyond. These may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws and include statements about financial trends, future results of operations and financial position, and market opportunities.

Can you talk about some of your cloud trends now that smartphones slowly picking up off some of the bottoms maybe earlier in the quarter? And just with the AT&T and the timing, when you think some of these Android deals, you'll start to see like a step-up in subscriber base based on anything that (28:07) you can share over the last couple of months?"

            "Yeah. Actually appreciate that. Couple things to think about in this environment that we're living in, you're absolutely right, the carriers obviously had closed doors. Carriers have announced that they're not even going to reopen some of the stores.",
            "The good thing is we're still seeing strong results. As we said, we're ahead of plan with our largest customer. One of the reasons is, is that actually these enhancements that we've been working with them on have obviously led to very decent gross adds, but we've also seen the churn drop way down with these customers.",
            "So, we are actually in a good spot with the majority of our customers as far as how they've executed working with us. And as I said in my comments, we have marketing work we're doing, which we are hoping to increase in the second half of the year, not just with Verizon, but with all.",
            "And then when you asked about AT&T, yes, we were very candid as we would plan to always be that some things got pushed back based on COVID. But you saw AT&T make announcements around their devices and did some very exciting announcements that they're going to focus on cloud in those Android devices. So we expect to start seeing that pick up immediately here in the third quarter.",
            "I think the opportunity, though, Mike, is there. I mean the carriers are looking for opportunities to grow revenue. This is a fantastic opportunity that they see and understand. I'm very, very optimistic that we can continue that trend for the remainder of the year and to 2021."

Just, Glenn, overall, it sounds like IoT, maybe some digital, some things got pushed out because it's just tougher to engage with customers face-to-face. Can you about any deals that's been lost or for existing maybe pushed out a little bit or just kind of how your remote sales is interacting in this tough environment?"

            "Digital actually is performing very well. I hope from my comments, you didn't take that away, but digital business is doing well. Most people, when they hear us talk about digital think about DXP, but we have a host of products in our digital platform as I said. And we've cut numerous deals during the quarter that were very, very exciting for us and whether on a financial and analytics side or the spatial side, as well as the continued work.",
            "I would tell you, Mike, that this environment, the future is all about digital. The future is all about touchless experiences. The future is and every company that we do business with is looking at how they're going to make it work in the new normal. And we have a lot of opportunity in our digital business to continue to grow it.",
            "On the IoT side, without question, we've done well. But the future of IoT is not just a smart building; it's a healthy building. And we have a SaaS platform that's extensible and flexible with machine learning and analytics attached. And candidly, a lot of people are coming to us now on the IoT side to talk about how not only can they make their building smart, but how can they make it healthy and know real time that it's healthy.",
            "The other thing that we're talking about is real-time remediation of pathogens in a building. And I would just say there's not going to be a building, a venue, a restaurant, that, as we go forward, people aren't going to want to know it's safe. And we believe we have a platform that can help do that, so we're \u2013 I'm \u2013 my enthusiasm around IoT has actually gone up. And I think we've got work to do, but so do others, and I think we've got a very competitive platform and product to offer."

            "But as carriers \u2013 not speaking outside of Verizon \u2013 as carriers look to how they're going to find incremental revenue and the dollars that they're all spending on 5G, massive amounts and billions of CapEx, we're going to continue to look for these opportunities.",
            "Verizon obviously has been a customer of ours for many years. We sat down with them and talked about the future and it just made sense for us to relook at the whole agreement. You also heard me talk about the fact that we now have a joint marketing agreement for the first time, which is really exciting for us because majority of the success we've had with them has been in that startup flow that we talk about for new and upgrades and we've done great, but my push and ask is that we have so much more opportunity to go back to their base, which obviously we are now going to do and do it together.",
            "The second piece of this is that the other initiatives that I mentioned. Obviously, we're excited about those and having conversations about where we want to take this platform. And by the way, we do this with all of our customers, right? Our customers have a beautiful Personal Cloud Platform that they may, obviously, want to have advantages. And so that's how we work with our customers individually.",
            "And so the opportunity on both sides, we're really wanting to elongate the agreement. Timing was not about when our first agreement ends; it's about where do we want to go in the future. And that's really was the catalyst."

We had deferred revenue that we've been recognizing over the past couple of years that would have basically been amortized out by the end of this year. As a result of the renewal, it gets extended for the remaining contract or the new contract life, I should say. So our deferred revenue runoff from this contract, in particular, will be under $1 million for each quarter going forward.",
