         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. So the dollar net charge-offs for the quarter were $38 million -- $38.1 million. That\u2019s up around 7.4% over the first quarter of last year."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. So now we need -- now I need to kind of dissect what happened with the provision a little bit, right? Because you obviously provisioned well south of that. It was $20-something million, $25 million, $26 million. You adopted CECL on April 1, right? Most lenders adopted CECL on January 1 and then had to do -- which didn\u2019t hit the P&L, and then had to do a subsequent day 2 revision to lifetime loss, which all hit the P&L in 1Q, right? You\u2019re reporting -- you\u2019re adopting CECL here in 2Q, and it was as of April 1. So, I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume them, and tell me if I\u2019m wrong, that your day 1 adoption, which obviously does not hit the P&L, included a COVID-19 assumption on the lifetime loss. Like there was an adjustment there on April 1 for what lifetime losses would be under COVID.",
            "So, that kind of moved -- again, please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. It kind of moved the pandemic losses all into day 1 and off of the P&L. And then obviously, as the loan portfolio shrunk through the quarter, which is not abnormal in this environment, you\u2019re effectively able to release reserves at a higher level because you had already bumped up the allowance to the COVID-19 pandemic level on day 1. So, I know it\u2019s kind of dense and a little bit of unpacking, but please tell me where or if that\u2019s incorrect."
         ],
         "Speaker": "John Rowan"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Right. So you\u2019re right. So because we adopted CECL on April 1, there was an adjustment for the future losses day 1 related to COVID, right? And that\u2019s in the release. It\u2019s $8.6 million -- I\u2019m sorry, $8.3 million for -- to adjust for future losses as of April 1, right? But that $8.3 million is still there at June 30. We didn\u2019t release that provision during the quarter. So we didn\u2019t actually experience higher losses during the first quarter, right? So those -- the adjustment for those future losses is really for launches that we still believe are still in the future, right? So up to this date, we\u2019ve had the response from the federal government with the federal unemployment and the stimulus that has prevented any incremental losses, right? But if those go away in the future, it could drive losses higher. So our assumption is that there won\u2019t be any future stimulus or support for unemployment from the federal government going forward."

         "Remarks": [
            "I didn\u2019t mean to -- okay. So let me clarify. I didn\u2019t mean to insinuate that you\u2019re releasing the COVID-19, that $8-point-something million reserve in the quarter on the day 2 experience. But you\u2019re probably -- I would assume, obviously, charge-offs were higher than the provision. Because the loan portfolio shrank, I assume that you released other allowances in the quarter, which, I mean, is kind of just simply a matter of fact with the provision being low to the charge-off. With the general reserves for the loan portfolio coming down, I thought that you have less reserves relative to your loans. But because the loans came down by nature, and this has been the case for you guys forever. When the loan portfolio shrinks, your provisions are lower than your charge-offs."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Right. So that was certainly part of it, right? So there\u2019s less originations during the quarter. So we needed to build the allowance less because of that. But we also saw a significant decrease in delinquency, and especially late-stage delinquency, during the quarter, right? And because of that, that also releases the allowance. And that likely was going to happen anyway, right? So the vast majority of the loans that we charged off during the first quarter had already been provided for in previous periods, right?",
            "So, if you remember, our March 31, 90-day delinquent amount was fairly high. So the accounts that we charged off were those -- those accounts are already 90 days past due. They weren\u2019t 90 days past due because of COVID. They were just -- that was really just the continuation of the higher losses and delinquencies we were seeing from adding all the new customers we added in the previous 18 months, right? So, a lot of that decrease in provision and the delinquency, what\u2019s going to happen regardless of any impacts from COVID, right? That\u2019s simply just as we\u2019ve kind of been saying for the last 12 months that as we cycle through these new customers, those delinquencies will come down. So now we\u2019ve seen that, right? So now delinquencies are very low at June 30, and the charge-offs were higher in Q1, but we should see those come down significantly going forward now that the 90-day delinquency has come down."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. So just a little bit of comparison here to another consumer lender that I had reported. And I just want to make sure that we\u2019re comparing apples-to-apples, right? So your delinquencies came down. We had another lender report delinquencies come down, but a lot of that is just consumer forbearance, right? And so even though delinquencies are down, it was largely because they were taking them off delinquency because of forbearance. Their systems were picking that up as not a delinquent account but one that required more allowances, even though the DQ technically is down, right? They\u2019re not TDRs. But we saw the reserves actually get built against a declining delinquency bucket in the quarter. That was yesterday, one of your -- one of -- another consumer lender reported. I\u2019m just curious if -- how much of your DQ reduction is a function of forbearance and whether or not you\u2019re adding anything to the allowance for -- or offsetting some of that allowance release because of lower DQ, basically, moving more towards like a TDR allowance on those loans."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Good question, John. This is Chad. So yes, like others, we\u2019ve also had forbearance or deferral programs. And the vast majority of our forbearances occurred in April. Roughly 1.5% of our loans had a forbearance event in April. Throughout the month of May and June, those basically declined to near 0%. During the whole quarter, on average, it was around 1.7% of the loans that are outstanding in April had a forbearance event with nearly 100% of those occurring in the month of April. So all of that\u2019s kind of already built in to the delinquencies that we would have at the end of the quarter."

So until those branches get back up to a sufficient number of accounts based on an APE metric that we manage to, they will remain furloughed."

         "Remarks": [
            "So, I mean, the actual charge-offs, at this point, delinquencies are still very low at June 30. The delinquency buckets across the board are decreasing, both on a dollar amount and percentage amount for July, right? So at this point, assuming 180 days to charge off, that pushes the actual charge-off until our fiscal fourth quarter. Now we reserve 100% once it gets to 90 days, right? So you\u2019d actually see the impact on the P&L in the fiscal third quarter. But yes, so that assumes that starting in August, we start to see a build in delinquencies, and they work their way through to 90 days past due in the third quarter."

         "Remarks": [

June, we\u2019re down around 15% to 18%. And that\u2019s the overall volume, but depending on the type of customer, whether they\u2019re a new customer, returning customer or an existing customer, you see variations within those. In June, we saw pretty large increases in demand across all 3 of those types of customers, notably in former customers and refinance customers."

I guess broad question, kind of looking forward to the rest of the year, is there any help you can give us on how to think about the future quarters in terms of reserving, in terms of yields demand and so forth?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So sure, I mean, it\u2019s a good question, right? A lot of that, I think, will depend on what the federal government does, right? So as Chad said, we have seen demand return in June and in July as well. If there\u2019s another round of stimulus, it\u2019s hard to know what that does, right? Presumably, that will decrease demand. But we think, at some point, historically, we\u2019ve seen on the backside of the recession, there is good demand for our products. So it\u2019s hard to know exactly when that\u2019s going to happen with the involvement of the government. But we do know, at some point, we expect demand to return.",
            "As the loan portfolio increases -- sort of increase, you would expect a build in the provision. How big that build is will be determined and, to some extent, by who -- which customers are coming, right? So if it\u2019s brand-new customers, there is a larger reserve bill, then if it\u2019s customers returning, former customers who paid us off and are coming back, right? Obviously, we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter, a lot of payoffs, and the overall population of former customers is significantly larger now than it has been in the past, right? So there\u2019s a big opportunity to bring a lot of those customers back in the future. And the reserve impact on those customers is less than a brand new customer."

         "Speaker": "John Calmes"
      },
      "27": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. And I want to make another point here along the same lines of what Johnny has talked about in terms of customer demand returning in June. Most of the states we operate in are in the Southeast and Southwest of the country. And these are states that began reopening fairly quickly compared to the Northern -- the more Northern states, especially the Northeast and Northwest of the country. So as states reopened, we began to see customer demand increase pretty rapidly in June as well as into July.",
            "We\u2019ve also rolled out a few initiatives to help increase customer convenience during this time. One of those is the ability to remote fund customers and basically service them online for originations, not just for payments. We saw adoption of this pretty quickly throughout the first quarter. We started in May. And so a pretty quick adoption across most of our states. Into July, I think we\u2019ll finish July somewhere around 14% to 15% of our loans being remote funded where the customer doesn\u2019t have to come into the branch.",
            "So even as states experience differences and how the coronavirus is affecting them, this gives customers the option and ability to be serviced without having to come into a branch for originations. So that\u2019s one of the things that I think will, depending on how things play out in terms of the pandemic, give customers a solid option to continue being serviced."

         "Remarks": [
            "So, we\u2019ve taken some looks at it. It\u2019s kind of hard to determine coming on the back end of tax season and also with delayed tax filing date as well. But it\u2019s fair to say that the stimulus certainly did have a pretty substantial increase in our payouts in April and May as well as a decrease in demand of those months."

So, something that we\u2019ve heard of and actually from some other companies who reported is just maybe there\u2019s some opportunities for portfolio purchases and acquisitions with some of the other struggling guys. I was wondering, since you\u2019ve done some portfolio acquisitions recently, any thoughts on that opportunity?"

There\u2019s potentially attractive deals that are being floated out there. There are some that were announced earlier this week. We\u2019re always in the market for things that could be accretive to the company. And so as long as we believe it\u2019s accretive, those options are always on the table for us."

And then your share repurchases, why -- if you could talk about kind of the timing of share repurchases. It seems like you want to accelerate them.

And obviously, we\u2019re nowhere near that. So yes, we reduced the net worth covenant to $325 million. We\u2019re comfortable running with a 10% cushion on top of that, right? We feel like that is sufficient, especially given where our allowances are and things of that nature."
