      "Jim Lico": [
         "Thanks, Griffin and good afternoon, everyone. Today we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.68 for the second quarter of 2020. As we delivered better than forecasted revenue performance despite the difficult conditions created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "It was a quarter that clearly reflected the power of the Fortive business system as we executed our playbook on expense, savings and working capital management, enabling us to achieve decremental margins of 33% and generate very strong free cash flow.",
         "Throughout the quarter, we continued to operate all of our essential production facilities around the world and proactively manage our supply chains, while adopting comprehensive new protocols to protect the health and safety of our employees.",
         "With a focus on maintaining continuity, despite the shift to a virtual operating environment, the Fortive team leveraged new virtual sales and marketing tools to continue to engage with customers. We also adjusted product development processes in order to continue to meet project timelines, while continuing to invest across the portfolio to emerge from this period with an enhanced competitive position.",
         "When we looked ahead on our Q1 earnings call in April, we faced a highly uncertain operating environment due to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Q2 performance demonstrated the resilience we built into the portfolio over the past four years, with an increased share of recurring revenue from our expanding set of subscription-based software solutions, services and consumables offerings.",
         "Recurring revenue accounted for more than 35% of total revenue in Q2, a new high for Fortive. Importantly, this resilience came through despite the fact that a key source of recurring revenue Advanced Sterilization Products experienced a decline in the elective surgical procedures as healthcare systems around the world weathered the early months of the pandemic.",
         "With respect on Vontier, we made additional progress in Q2 preparing for its separation from Fortive as we can continue to evaluate our options for structuring the separation either via spin or split. The Fortive and Vontier teams remain in a position to move forward an affective separation as soon as market conditions permit.",
         "Mark Morelli and Dave Naemura continue to guide the Vontier businesses through the challenging macro conditions, while also leading the build out of Vontier\u2019s organizational capacity as the team prepares for its future as an independent public company.",
         "We issued our most recent Corporate Social Responsibility Report at the end of Q2, highlighting the important progress we have made across our portfolio over the past year. Our CSR framework organizes our priorities into seven strategic pillars, which capture the full breadth of our initiatives around the Corporate Social Responsibility.",
         "Consistent with our belief in the strength that comes from building diverse teams, we have always aimed to cultivate an inclusive environment at Fortive. Over the past few months, we have acted on these values to help our teams advance an internal dialogue about addressing critical broader themes of social justice.",
         "As we look to continue living our values and fulfilling our commitment to our employees in our communities, the Fortive and Vontier teams will remain strongly committed to increase diversity, equality and inclusion as a key tenant of our culture and our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts.",
         "With that, let\u2019s turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $241.9 million, down 25% from the prior year and adjusted net \u2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.68. Total sales declined 15.7% to $1.6 billion, including a 16.8% core revenue decline, reflecting the significant negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "Acquisitions contributed 270 basis points of growth, while unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 160 basis points. Gross margins held up well in Q2 at 52%, supported by the growing contribution of our high margin software businesses. Gross margins also benefited from 70 basis points of price and disciplined supply chain execution.",
         "Given the top line challenges, core operating margin decreased 220 basis points, resulting in an adjusted operating profit margin of 20.2%. This adjusted operating margin reflected total cost actions of greater than $100 million executed during the quarter in response to the widespread deterioration and macro economic conditions.",
         "During the second quarter, we generated $454 million of free cash, representing conversion of 188% of adjusted net earnings. The strong free cash flow performance reflected a proactive response taken by our operating companies using FBS to improve inventory turns and accounts receivable driving $165 million of tailwind from working capital in Q2. It also showed the increased resilience of free cash flow generation across the portfolio driven by specific portfolio transformation actions taken over the past few years.",
         "Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted a total sales decline of a 11%, including a 14.4% decline in core revenue. Acquisitions contributed 450 basis points, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by a 110 basis points. Core operating margin decreased 140 basis points, resulting in segment level adjusted operating margin of 23.1%.",
         "Industrial Technologies posted a total sales decline of 23.7%, including a 20.8% decline in core revenue. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 250 basis points. Core operating margin decreased 250 basis points, resulting in segment level adjusted operating margin of 19.6%.",
         "Looking across the major geographies. Our performance in Q2 continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 headwinds, what was broadly better than expected. The region-by-region breakdown, as shown on Slide 9 of the earnings presentation, ultimately reflected each regions relative progress in terms of economic reopening, as well as local public health dynamics, as the quarter progressed.",
         "In Asia, core revenue declined to low double-digits in Q2, representing a significant improvement from the prior quarter driven primarily by China. China was down mid single-digits in the quarter. We continue to see steady signs of progress across our China businesses as they climb back from the low point experienced back in February.",
         "All of our major businesses in China experienced significant sequential improvement in Q2, with a number of operating companies including Fluke and ASP returning to year-over-year growth. We were encouraged by the positive signs coming out of Q2, including improving point-of-sale trends at Fluke and Tektronix and elective surgery volumes for ASP back to approximately 90% of the levels that prevailed prior to the onset of the pandemic.",
         "Looking across the rest of Asia, Japan likewise saw sequential improvement in Q2, while India and Southwest \u2013 Southeast Asia remain more challenging. India, in particular, saw severe economic lockdown measures put into place for much of Q2. This significantly limited access to customers for sales and marketing activities, as well as services implementation.",
         "Western Europe core revenue declined high-teens in Q2. The quarter played out largely as expected with significant challenges through April and then sequential improvement in May and June as economies began to reopen. The resulting top line for Western Europe was a bit better than expected in Q2, particularly in light of relatively weaker trends in the region prior to the onset of the pandemic.",
         "Notably, ASP posted low single-digit growth and strong Terminal Sterilization capital sales and incremental consumable revenue from N95 respirator reprocessing helped offset a significant decline in total surgical procedure volume. Demand trends for Fluke and Tektronix, while still down significantly showed some improvement over the course of the quarter.",
         "North America core revenue also declined high-teens in Q2, similar to Western Europe, the US bottomed in April and then saw a sequential improvement across May and June, resulting in a better than expected high-teens decline in total revenue. Improvement over the back half of the quarter was driven by the widespread lifting of lockdown measures, although customer access remains limited in certain markets.",
         "North America does benefit from the resilient performance of our software businesses, many of which drive the majority of the revenue in the region and provide important stability in Q2. We believe improving trends for elective surgical procedure volumes, continued EMV related demand to GVR and early signs of POS improvement at Fluke create the possibility for further sequential top line progress in the coming quarters.",
         "That said, we continue to monitor the risks associated with rising COVID-19 infection rates and hotspots across the country and any re-imposition of lockdowns which may be required. Finally, we saw a mid-teens decline in the Middle East and a greater than 20% decline in Latin America. Weakness in the Middle East reflected the combined impact of COVID-19 and budgetary pressures across the region tied to challenging conditions in the oil and gas market. ",
         "While Latin America experienced the spread of COVID-19 a bit later than other regions, the impact became significant in Q2, with particular headwinds for our businesses in Mexico and Brazil. We anticipate that conditions will likely remain challenging throughout both these regions as we look through the end of the year.",
         "Last quarter, we laid out a framework for analyzing our portfolio found on Slide 10 of today\u2019s presentation, with businesses organized into groups based on relative sensitivity to pandemic disruption and resulting deterioration and market demand.",
         "As shown on Slide 11, the performance in Q2 across the four indicated groups played out very much in line with our expectations for the quarter. Group one, which represented approximately 14% of total revenue in Q2 showed significant resilience and posted mid single-digit growth for the quarter, despite the challenging economic conditions.",
         "The Groups\u2019 performance reflected a strong contribution from a number of our software businesses, Intelex grew mid-teens, eMaint grew high single-digits, Gordian was up slightly and the SaaS & Maintenance portion of Accruent was relatively flat.",
         "Group I also benefited from very strong demand at Fluke\u2019s Industrial Imaging business, where customer response to COVID-19 drove very strong growth in the quarter. We\u2019re excited about the continued near-term demand trends for these product lines at Fluke and the potential to accelerate a broader Industrial Imaging strategy.",
         "As expected, Group II, which represents approximately 48% of total revenue in Q2 was significantly impacted early in the quarter by lockdowns. Overall, the Group\u2019s improvement over the back half of the quarter resulted in mid-teens revenue decline, roughly 10 points better than expected.",
         "For AFP, surgical procedure volumes in both the US and Western Europe troughed at levels higher than those experienced to China in Q1, and subsequently bounced back faster than expected to drive higher consumables usage during the quarter.",
         "At GVR, where bookings increased mid single-digits in the first half of the year, the pandemic impacted our ability to convert orders to deliveries in Q2. Despite the push out of the liability decline, we continue to see strong demand for EMV upgrades in North America.",
         "Elsewhere in Group II, the recurring revenue business models of ISC\u2019S iNet and Fluke Health Solutions land our dosimetry business provided added resilience in the second quarter. Fluke Health Solutions, which grew low single-digits in Q2 also saw a strong demand for ventilator calibrators related to the fight against COVID-19.",
         "Group III, which represented approximately 15% of total revenue in Q2 performed better than we had anticipated in the second quarter with mid-teens decline. The group\u2019s performance was highlighted by Matco, which saw significant pressure early in the quarter, but then a strong recovery in orders as lockdowns began to lift.",
         "Elsewhere, the Sensing portfolio saw pressure across a number of its core industrial end markets. This was partially offset by growth in semiconductors driven by demand for datacenter upgrades and infrastructure as well as COVID related tailwinds in medical end markets.",
         "Specifically, Setra and Gems saw strong demand for critical environment products and ventilator components, respectively. Accruent\u2019s Professional Services business faced significant headwinds in the quarter, but adjusted with new safety protocols and remote delivery capabilities to help address COVID-19 related restrictions and drive better performance later in the quarter.",
         "Group IV which represented approximately 23% of total Q2 revenue, experienced the most top line pressure in the quarter as expected and posted an almost 30% decline. That said, businesses in Group four showed earlier signs of improvement than we had anticipated in April.",
         "Notably, Fluke\u2019s Core Industrial business saw improvement in point-of-sale across its major regions, with Asia POS positive in Q2, and Europe in the US improving off their early Q2 lows. The Tektronix Instruments business performed largely as expected in the second quarter with sequential improvement in China. Conditions remain challenged, but we anticipate some sequential improvement at Tek in the second half.",
         "The combination of top line resilience, strong margin execution and substantial cash flow generation enabled us to continue to enhance our liquidity position and pay down debt as expected during the second quarter. We ended the quarter with over $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet, in addition to our undrawn, $2 billion revolving credit facility.",
         "While there were plenty of immediate challenges to address in Q2, we continue to play offense across our portfolio, running our FBS playbook by using dynamic resource allocation to invest in key growth initiatives to enhance our long-term competitive position.",
         "We remain focused on driving innovation across the portfolio using the FORT, our centralized artificial intelligence and data analytics hub to bring more advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities to bear in our workflow solutions, while also expanding our use of the growth accelerator process to fund potential growth breakthrough opportunities.",
         "In May, we established a partnership with Pioneer Square Labs to help incubate industrial technology companies capable of bringing new products to market in an accelerated fashion in addition to our internal development processes.",
         "Sustained investment has enabled our operating companies to quickly address emerging opportunities, including the growing demand for critical environmental solutions, et cetera and Industrial Imaging products at Fluke driven by the response to COVID-19.",
         "The same investment has also enabled the completion of longer-term development of critical next generation products, such as Teletrac Navman, newly introduced TN360 Telematics platform, which is expected to form a core part of its offering going forward.",
         "Importantly, we\u2019re also investing to expand our commercial operations, particularly among our software businesses. We continue to expand Intelex\u2019s European sales team to help capitalize on growth opportunities outside the US and build the capability of Censis to address attractive opportunities emerging in the ambulatory surgery center market.",
         "At ASP, despite challenges reaching customers in the quarter, our continued investment in sales and service enabled the team to quickly address the near-term N95 respirator reprocessing opportunities. Despite the better trends we saw coming out of Q2, macro conditions remain challenging with the potential for future volatility.",
         "This is particularly in light of persistent challenges associated with global efforts to keep COVID-19 infection rates under control. Consistent with Q2, we are not providing a guide, but we are providing additional color on expected performance for the coming quarter.",
         "We expect that total revenue will improve sequentially in Q3, but decrease by 5% to 8% on a year-on-year basis. We will continue to calibrate any remaining cost actions based on the top line progression from here as we manage to decremental margins of approximately 35% in Q3. As we look ahead, we also expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and deliver a free cash flow conversion ratio of greater than 110% of adjusted net earnings for the full year.",
         "The second quarter of 2020 was truly an unprecedented period. As we had to quickly adjust to an unfolding global public health crisis, and a resulting deterioration of the global macroeconomic environment. We weathered the storm delivering financial performance that significantly exceeded our expectations three months ago.",
         "As such, our Q2 performance demonstrated the progress we have made with our portfolio transformation over the past four years, establishing a more resilient top line and sustained cash flow performance through the cycle.",
         "More importantly, as we leverage the foundation of FBS to sustain our performance and develop new virtual collaboration tools, we continue looking forward by making the investments in innovation and team development that will lay the groundwork for the continuation of our portfolio transformation.",
         "Finally, I am extremely proud of our team\u2019s efforts over the past three months, and while we undoubtedly face additional challenges in the coming quarters. I\u2019m confident in our ability to navigate through them as we continue to generate substantial value for our employees, customers, shareholders and our communities.",
         "With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Griffin."

            "Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Chuck. Thanks, Griffin. Good evening, good afternoon. Obviously the 3Q, you know, sales range of down pathways is obviously quite a bit better than you know what you\u2019re pointing towards In April and then what you realized in the quarter. So I\u2019m just curious, you know, how and I, you know, don\u2019t exactly want to blah, blah, blah here. But you know, as we went through June-July, what are you seeing, you know, not necessarily by business, but just generally, what do you see in terms of organic sales progression as we went through the quarter and into July?"

         "Remarks": [
            "But, thanks, Nigel. Yeah I think a couple of things relative to the trends, I think we certainly as we sort of said in the prepared remarks, progressively things got better as we got through the quarter. So, you know, I think every month got a little bit better certainly from a trend perspective.",
            "July is just in and is probably good as well, but good in the sense of giving us confidence as to the guide. So, I think the trends are certainly getting better. I think it\u2019s difficult to necessarily know how long they\u2019ll continue and hence the, you know, like through the end of the fourth quarter, but I think as we look at the near-term trend, they look pretty good.",
            "And certainly as we said, you know, we have a good sense of what EMV is going to look like in the back half. That\u2019s a driver, obviously, macro getting better is another example. So that really covers industrial tech and on the Professional Instrumentation side, elective surgery still, you know, on the right trend, the software business is staying resilient and certainly some of the POS transit Fluke starting to be a little bit better as well."

            "Thanks, Jim. And you know, the decremental margins obviously were very encouraging, you seem to have a really good firm grip on the cost management side of it, you know, 35% decremental margin outlook for 3Q. I know you had confidence that you could, you know, kind of maintain or kind of like bring back those gross margin decrementals into that range you put out there. So should we think about, you know, your 3Q, 4Q in that sort of 35% range, you know or is there a scope for it to be to look better in 4Q if we continue to see the improvement trends into 4Q? Thanks."

At least, that it seems at this point in time, and that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re guiding there. So, we\u2019ll strike that balance of managing our expenses and investing into the future that as we go forward. So 35% is the right number."

I \u2013 everything look pretty encouraging here overall and I\u2019m just trying to think it\u2019s probably fifth or sixth earnings call today so a little beating up.",
            "But Chuck, you commented on \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Jim actually commented on the 70 basis points of price and I didn\u2019t get a sense is that 70 basis point generally come in that bucket of 35% recurring revenue where, you know, you\u2019re able to get a little bit more pricing power or is there some other base level price increase that, you know, you have across the board?"

So, you know, to get that it was mostly in Professional Instrumentation in the quarter, Scott. So, you know, I would say and certainly the software businesses were part of that. But we had good mark. You know, we had good price in some of our key hardware businesses as well like Fluke and Tek.",
            "So I think across the board as we think about our playbook, you know, certainly on the expense side, we talked about $100 million of cost reductions in the quarter, but also part of that playbook is trying to find opportunity for price. And I think the teams did an exceptional effort, you know, in the quarter to try where those opportunities exist, they took advantage of them and while you know, I think and we will continue to do that through the rest of the year."

But when you get to the decrementals, I don\u2019t \u2013 they don\u2019t behave all that different between the two."

Maybe just circling back to the revenue outlook, so you\u2019re dialing in around about a 10 point less bad year-on-year drop in the third quarter than what you saw in the second quarter. Is there any more detail you could provide around that narrowing, you know, either on a segment basis for PI versus IT, and/or on that Group I to IV basis, just to help us sort of understand what\u2019s driving that improvement?"

We\u2019ve got you know, if you think about the IT, the Vontier Group, We\u2019ve got Matco really, you know, is continuing to show some strength there. And then we\u2019ve got that EMV secular trend that\u2019s going to be helping GVR, those are \u2013 were impacted in Q2 by the lockdown.",

And when you look at Professional Instrumentation, I think that\u2019s sequentially going to improve. That\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing, you know, to these \u2013 some of these acquisitions doing really well and then again, getting a little bit of a lift from the lockdown coming off. So I\u2019d see that improving to down high single-digit in Q3."

There was a big working cap tailwind in Q2, generally in the first half receivables, in particular, freed up $200 million plus of cash, I think. So maybe help us understand what\u2019s happening with working capital in the second half as you\u2019re seeing this revenue outlook improve on the extent to which you\u2019re seeing an improvement in the ASP business around that free cash flow profile."

I think \u2013 we think the tailwind from working capital from Q1 to Q2 is about $165 million and because you know, when you take a look at everything in there, and I think that that was just a lot of great work by our teams getting on things early, managing inventory level appropriately, you know, it\u2019s an example of managing which can manage and that gave us a, you know, a good push. And as you saw cash flow overall was very strong at $450 million.",
            "I think that what I would expect going forward, it really depends on how steep the sequential improvement continues to be going into the second half. But I\u2019d expect a little bit of a tailwind but not at the same level. It\u2019s probably, you know, maybe a half to a third of that coming back as a tailwind. Again, it really just depends on how steep the increase quarter-over-quarter is."

            "Julian, I would just add a couple of things. You know, number one is, we\u2019re really happy with what we saw relative to free cash flow. You know, a lot of times we\u2019ll talk about those working capital tailwinds in a way that suggests that it doesn\u2019t actively have to be managed. The last time I checked customers weren\u2019t in a hurry to pay us last quarter.",
            "So the work that we did, I think we\u2019re using FBS was really profound. It\u2019s also using it to capture and keep those up those advantages once we get into, you know, a little bit of growth mode or less \u2013 you know, less, you know, less down, if you will. I would say the second thing I\u2019d add is, you know, when we look at the, you know, historically, we said we would preserve, you know, somewhere in the 80 to \u2013 80 percentage range of free cash flow, when we were in a down cycle. And we\u2019ve been talking about that for four years.",
            "And I think what you saw in the quarter, and what you\u2019re going to see in the year is better than that. Obviously, we\u2019re much better than that, in the second quarter, we think, you know, we can \u2013 we\u2019ll do better into the 90s for the full year. So I think what you\u2019re seeing is the strength of the portfolio, the higher gross margins in PI particularly around software, I think our gross margins in PII for the quarter were around 36%. So the ability to drive more free cash out of the portfolio, given the changes I think also gives us some confidence that free cash in the remaining part of the year will be good as well."

So sales are going to come in better, that\u2019s going to free up spending. You know, you provided a couple examples here on what you\u2019re working on. Should we expect most of that delta is going into growth or I would assume there\u2019s some restoration of just kind of, you know, temporary things that you had to kind of, you know, choke down here in the second quarter?"

And we\u2019re focused on managing gross margins, you saw good, really good work on the part of the teams to do that in the quarter. There\u2019s the temporary cost actions, there\u2019s the permanent set of cost actions. And then there\u2019s this fourth part about dynamic resource allocation, which is moving money around to the highest opportunities, which is, I think, where you\u2019re going at.",
            "So we\u2019re managing the decrementals relative to those things. We\u2019re making decisions about temporary and permanent cost reductions as we really understand the outlook more or less into 2021. And those decisions are probably more in the coming months. But I think the most important thing, where you\u2019re going is, we\u2019re really making sure we\u2019re funding the growth opportunities that are inevitably going to create competitive advantage over time.",
            "A good example is the FORT, where we bring data analytics projects for the businesses, our projects are up 3x from where they were a year ago. So we\u2019re doing 3 times the number of data analytics projects that we were doing a year ago. I think that\u2019s a big focus. You\u2019re hearing a lot about digital transformation around companies. And I think that\u2019s really what we do at the FORT is leading that for both our operating companies and some internal projects that we\u2019re doing for Fortive.",
            "So I think that\u2019s one example. Maybe one other example is, you know, we\u2019re continuing to accelerate all of our investments in the software businesses where, you know, a number of our software businesses are really able to take advantage of a lot of the going back to work, challenges that occur, the changes in facilities, the new safety \u2013 health and safety protocols that exist in facilities and buildings.",

So, you know, there\u2019s some delays, but there\u2019s no \u2013 we often get the question about new construction, it\u2019s really not new construction, it\u2019s really changes that are going on in the facility.",
            "So we think, you know, with everything going on with COVID and facility changes required around protocols that ultimately that business will come back. And as you said, the purchasing construction dollar will start to flow back through Gordian and ultimately, the revenue will get \u2013 will be, you know, back in growth mode.",
            "They\u2019ve been, as you know, a double \u2013 a strong double-digit grower for quite some time now, we still think we\u2019ve got great opportunity there. Accruent a little bit more complex in that regard. You know, we saw some, again, we\u2019re seeing a lot of good growth in the businesses that are really tied to facilities and facilities management and really returning to work, assessment work, our high cloud opportunities are EMS business, our Connected Healthcare businesses.",

And again, they\u2019re doing \u2013 they\u2019re much more resilient. Where we saw the challenges that Accruent is really one on the license revenue side. And again, on the Managed Service side, got a little bit better as we said in the prepared remarks like the \u2013 some of the Managed Services got better at the end of the quarter as we were able to get more on-site and be able to do some of our work remotely.",

Just a couple of questions here for mine, I guess, you know, first on businesses that go through distribution, I guess, you know, Fluke and Tek kind of come to mind first. How do you characterize kind of sell-in versus sell-out? I think when supply chain delays and distributor restocking, we\u2019ve seen you know a bit of backlog carried in for some other short cycle guys into the second half.

Our inventory positions have remained pretty much, I would say, flat to down, so no real inventory built. So I think as we get into the second half, we don\u2019t anticipate any big issues relative to inventory. On the other hand, we don\u2019t expect really distributors to necessarily take on inventory.",

But I would say if you said, let\u2019s talk about the lion\u2019s share of our capital allocation over the next several years, it\u2019s really going to be in building in those groups that are articulated I and II.

How do you start to think about incrementals? You know, for PI and Vontier, what do we manage to there?

So recovering that revenue if it went down at 35% and I think of it coming back at 35%. Beyond that, it really depends on where we\u2019re growing as you mentioned, some of our \u2013 some of the software business obviously have higher decrementals, you know, as you move forward in time.

But as you go through the year and think of it being $50 million in permanent action, that\u2019s on top of the actions we took in Q4 of last year where we did \u2013 [technical difficulty] [60 million] [ph] [technical difficulty].",

Some of the checks we\u2019ve did it sounds like that rate is reflective of some of the kind of specialty hospitals, but like the big hospitals were more like in the 75% range. And I\u2019m just curious how you kind of view? Is that \u2013 just is that geared toward more a specific type of facility?

But we definitely think it continue to see we really get the data by day and we are seeing continued improvement through July as well. So we think things will continue [technical difficulty].

I think, you know, China\u2019s going to get better through the second half, but I don\u2019t necessarily think that China gets to any dramatic growth rate in the second half. I think it gets better. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen enough to think that things are going to, you know, get significantly better.",
            "So I think our China theory here at this point is probably better. The rest of Asia, I think is a little mixed. As we mentioned, India continues to have a lot of lockdowns. And but we think by the end of the year, our India business and money \u2013 in many respects is driven by the GVR business. And we think that there\u2019s a number of things that \u2013 but the order pattern there\u2019s been very good. So we think India might get better by the end of the year.",
            "I think as we think about the Middle East, we think about Latin America, we don\u2019t anticipate anything getting better there. So that kind of gives you the high growth market view. The US will definitely get better through the remaining part of the year. I think the \u2013 and I would anticipate, whereas I don\u2019t necessarily see Western Europe getting that much better with the rest of the year.",
            "And the difference there is, we have the EMV tailwind in the US, we have Matco getting better in the US, we have ASP getting better, which is a bigger US business than it does at European business. And Fluke\u2019s point of sale is getting better.",
            "So I would say North America tends to get better through the remaining part of the year. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Western Europe, in particular, wasn\u2019t ripened to begin with when we sort of started with COVID. And I anticipate that to be a little bit more long \u2013 longer drawn out recovery. Hope to be proven wrong there, but that would sort of be our sort of thought process as we get into the second half year."

As you know in the rest of the world, a number of our customers are integrated oil companies and so oil and gas prices has a little bit more impact in some parts of the world than it does in the US, where that\u2019s a disaggregated market. So I do think the second half still follows some of those patterns that I was describing relative to the economy.",
            "But I think I think India in particular will continue. I think our position in India is very good. We, you know, we\u2019ve done a number of acquisitions there, Orpak acquisition or Matco acquisition, we have a very good position, we have great relationships with customers. So I\u2019m confident, as you said, it can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but if we look year-on-year-on-year, we built a really good business there and I\u2019m confident that the team will continue to execute there.",

And I think they\u2019re executing well there and some markets are going to continue to be okay. So I think GVR, in general, will, you know, it\u2019ll depend on the market and country. But I think, you know, we\u2019ll see a little bit better order pattern likely in the second half and on the backs of a continued strong EMV market in North America."

You know, what it really is, as we agree on an idea generation process, we devote, we have a number of Fortive people that work at the lab alongside the PSL team, we generate ideas, we find an idea that we want to invest in, we invest in it, we have a couple of different milestones where we can decide if we want to bring that in or continue to invest in it.",

But we also have the economics if it\u2019s a great idea, but that isn\u2019t necessarily that would be something consistent with what Fortive wants to become.

So it\u2019s really a framework for that, as you know, a number of our businesses are really built with portions of group I, II, III, and IV all together.",
            "So, you know, just take an example, like Fluke, as we said before, you know, a good chunk of Fluke is in Group I and II is in I and II. So and increasingly becoming a growing part of that. So I don\u2019t think it necessarily says that our individual businesses are necessarily going to be, you know, not invested in, but what we\u2019re going to find in a number of our businesses, within our businesses or within our operating companies, probably the best words is we\u2019re finding those opportunities to build more resilient, more durable, more higher growth aspects of the business and that\u2019s where, you know, we\u2019ll probably end up having more of our investments.",
            "So as Fluke is a good example. You know, we bought eMaint, we bought PRUFTECHNIK, but we also bought Landauer. So we, you know, a good chunk of that capital that we deployed into Fluke in the last few years has been to add those Is and IIs to the core Fluke business. I think we have those same opportunities for some of the parts of group III and IV, that we can also do, you know, even within Sensing Tech, some of the things we talked about that are driving the growth there and Environmental Monitoring as another example, those are places where we\u2019re investing in those businesses, because those parts of the businesses really have Group II and Group I aspects to them."

Is this a \u2013 is that what you guys were referencing and, you know, can you just comment more on that, that\u2019s you know, an area that could see our outsized growth within PI?"

So a number of things that we\u2019ve got going and we\u2019ll see how it goes and whether it\u2019s sort of a, you know, whether that you know, we really think the resiliency and durability that we might be able to build here is beyond just COVID-19 and we\u2019re excited to try to build on that here in the coming quarters."

Hey, I was wondering, given Chuck, you inferred you\u2019ve kind of your comments about North America is getting better and so forth. Is the implication that just is the impact from COVID flaring up and surging in the southern states in California or that you are seeing, you know, impact but that other aspects of the business are superseding that, like how to think about this, because, you know, what you\u2019re describing isn\u2019t that dissimilar from other industrial companies. So I\u2019m just curious kind of what you\u2019re seeing on ground, kind of regionally and how that plays out?"

         "Remarks": [
            "I would say the biggest place, the two biggest places, John, where we see COVID impact relative to call it, daily stuff or maybe the three places is really in the hospitals and sterilization procedures that we described a little while ago, it\u2019s getting Matco equipment in the ground, or sorry, getting GVR equipment in the ground and really the Matco ability to call on customers every day. So I think as we look through, and those are big US businesses as well.",
            "So, you know, those are kind of COVID related. The point-of-sale, stuff at Fluke is really economic related. You want to see you know better PMI, better IP numbers so and that\u2019s probably a global point for Fluke, but so what we\u2019re really watching for is, you know, the surgery numbers, the ability to not go back into lockdown.",
            "As we mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, the lockdown really impacted Matco. April was, you know, was a really tough month. But as soon as things started to open up, it accelerated back to what we would normally call a pretty resilient business, quite frankly, historically relative to economic cycles. And I think I saw today that car \u2013 average car ownership years is that of the highest point it\u2019s ever been which is a good thing for Matco.",
            "So I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re watching for. We don\u2019t want to see hospitals close back down. We don\u2019t want to say \u2013 see cities get back into lockdown mode where they won\u2019t be \u2013 where auto repair shops aren\u2019t open or that, you know, construction can\u2019t occur and sites can\u2019t be upgraded at Gilbarco \u2013 for Gilbarco."

And I ask it in the context of, is this going to be somewhat contingent on the volunteer separation and getting that dividend from volunteer to do the reload and lower the debt to cap or debt to EBITDA thresholds back again or are the two somewhat disassociated in terms of the tracks? I.e., one does not necessarily contingent on the other?"

            "Well, I think first and foremost, you know, we always said this year would be a bolt-on \u2013 more likely a bolt-on year because of digesting a number of things that we did last year as well. And I think that\u2019s been our thesis, although you never can be \u2013 we\u2019ve looked at some fairly sizable things. So, you know, I think at the end of the day we\u2019ve continued to be busy. I think there continues to be a couple of things that are impacting the M&A market. I know some of our peers have talked about this. One is the bid-ask spreads are still not in alignment necessarily. It\u2019s hard to distinguish the COVID impact from things and that takes sometimes an additional quarter two that results to work through with a seller.",
            "The second piece of it, it\u2019s just harder to do due diligence, right. We can\u2019t get on site in many cases, we can\u2019t meet people. And so I think things are slower by nature of those two aspects. And then \u2013 but I think we\u2019ve been busy, we continue to think that there\u2019s opportunity, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that it\u2019s tied to the Vontier separation. But you know, because of the fact that really, we never were really tying those things together to begin with. But certainly Vontier certainly when we complete the Vontier transaction, it certainly gives us, you know, more firepower and more opportunity."

I mean, we haven\u2019t necessarily said we\u2019re not going to do anything, because, you know, there are certain things that we\u2019ve been cultivating for several years. And we, you know, we can\u2019t say, hey, do you mind, you know, selling at a different time. So, you know, things are going to sell when they\u2019re going to sell and we have to be responsive to that. But, you know, we\u2019re obviously taking into account the economic conditions and all the things that might impact returns.",

But I think at the end of the day, we\u2019re focused on making sure we can create value in a focused, prioritized way that probably ends up being more bolt-ons than not, but we are \u2013 we do have our ear to the railroad if there\u2019s other opportunities."

So I\u2019m just wondering, was that the case for you guys in the quarter \u2013 in the second quarter sort of the as needed stuff, which maybe help enrich the mix, particularly in PI?

So I think you know, well, you know, more consumables is obviously higher margin, more, you know, more Matco is higher margin. So, you know, number, obviously, the software businesses are high margin, but there\u2019s some of our newer businesses, so they don\u2019t necessarily represent the highest operating profit margin. So I think, as our core businesses come back that, in some respects you might suggest is certainly a help as we look at margin expansion in the \u2013 you know, over the next year or so."
