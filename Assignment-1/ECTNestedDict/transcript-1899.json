         "Good morning, everyone. Our Q2 performance was surprisingly strong given the extent of the economic and social disruption has certainly exceeded our expectations. We're pleased with the results.",
         "But that being said, we still face much uncertainty regarding the future path of the economy. With the COVID-19 uncertainty still present, it's difficult to look too far ahead.",
         "What we can say is that compared to the comments we made at the end of Q1, our outlook has turned relatively positively. We are hopeful the trends established in Q2 will continue strongly into the third quarter.",
         "I'm speaking specifically of substantially higher seasonal residential origination, good commercial segment success that originate larger volumes at higher spreads and very good employee productivity.",
         "Reflecting about our markets in the second quarter, some of our commercial competitors temporarily reduced their activities, and First National increased its market share while experiencing wider spread. Although most competitors are now returning to the market, wider spreads are still persisting.",
         "On our residential side, we experienced substantial origination growth, which in part was due to the COVID-19 disruptions experienced by chartered banks and their branch network and mobile sales force channels. With MERLIN, we did not face these same kind of disruptions and nor will we.",
         "On the funding side, stronger demand from institutional investors continues because of the substantial amount of liquidity now in the financial system as a result of the government's actions in providing facilities to purchase securities and a slowdown of asset originations at most financial institutions.",
         "Securitization markets have normalized, as Stephen said. Similar in 2009, when we emerged from the credit crisis, first National is now benefiting from wider mortgage coupons related to our funding costs on the new originations. If wider spreads persist, the company will continue to benefit as we did in Q2.",
         "Of course, any forecast must be tempered by the fact that the duration and impact of COVID-19 outbreak is still unknown and is the long-term success of the government and Central Bank interventions. It appears that the government's willingness to do whatever it takes to support Canadians remains a strong endeavor, and it is certainly comforting to know that the emergency wage and business subsidies have been extended.",
         "That said, it's simply not possible to reliably estimate the length or the severity of the pandemic and its impact on the financial results and condition of our company. What is comforting to know is that we have strong relationships with mortgage brokers, a diverse funding source, and these factors continue to set First National apart from its competition. Additionally, we'll continue to generate income and cash flow from our $33 billion portfolio of mortgages pledged under securitization and now $80 billion of servicing portfolio while focusing on the value inherent in our single-family renewal book.",
         "In closing, I would like to add my thanks to the First National employees, partners and customers and extend our sincere hope that you stay safe as this health crisis continues to play out.",
         "That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines for questions."

         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to First National\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Analyst Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time on how to queue up to ask a question. This call is being recorded for replay purposes on July 28th at 10:00 o\u2019clock A.M. Eastern Time.",
         "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Stephen Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of First National. Please proceed, Mr. Smith."

      "Robert Inglis": [
         "Good morning, everyone. Q2 financial results were much improved over Q1 and higher than a year ago. During my remarks, I will refer primarily to year-over-year comparisons, I just have to say that MUA grew second quarter itself by 5% or $1.4 billion.",
         "Starting with revenue, it increased 3% between the 2 seconds quarters. A part of this growth reflected a change in fair market value gains and losses related to interest rate movements between the quarters. At the first quarter, First National recorded fair market value losses on its total short bond book in the second quarter.",
         "We use the short bonds to mitigate the interest rate risk related to funded single-family and multiresidential mortgages held prior to securitization but also for outstanding single-family commitments. These losses amounted to about $34 million in the quarter, but we were able to apply hedge accounting to almost -- about $26 million of this amount. In the end, we were left with about an $8 million loss by using these interim -- instruments. If we eliminate any changes in market value gains and losses between the quarters, Q2 revenue was 2% higher than a year ago.",
         "Let's look at the major contributors to revenue. Q2 placement fees increased 47% or $28.3 million due to increased mortgage spreads and the crystallization of higher-mortgage-rate single-family commitments originated in the first quarter, which transformed into funded mortgages in the second quarter.",
         "The company also increased its spreads in multiresidential products, which translated to higher placement fees. Q2 mortgage servicing income increased 5% or about $2 million due to growth in revenue driven by the company's underwriting and fulfillment processing servicing business.",
         "Revenue growth in these activities as well as a 124% growth in gains on deferred placement fees more than offset lower net interest revenue and lower mortgage investment income. Net interest revenue earned on securitized mortgages decreased 39% or about $13.6 million largely due to the financial consequences of the pandemic, including temporary compression in securitization spreads and the cost of indemnities payable to NHA MBS debtholders.",
         "To get a bit more detail, the company reduced prime rate in March by 1.5%, following the Bank of Canada's overnight rate adjustments. However, when the funding cost of prime rate debt related to NHA MBS and asset-backed commercial paper conduits were reset on April 1, the cost of funds for the month of April was lower by just 90 basis points, resulting in a 60 basis point compression in securitization spread, reducing the earnings -- company's earnings by about $4 million.",
         "Although funding costs normalized in May and June, the cost of funds related to ABCP conduits continue to be higher than last year. We believe this is partially a result of ABCP conduits selling 3-month paper so that prepandemic rates are still being passed through. While these costs have decreased recently, they are still higher than the last year, and this reduced securitization margins by an additional $2 million.",
         "But the most significant impact was the cost of indemnities payable to debtholders when mortgages prepaid prior to their scheduled maturity date. Indemnities are calculated to make whole NHA MBS debtholders who are assumed to reinvest the prepayment principal at risk-free reinvestment rates.",
         "With the recent in interest rates, the cost of these indemnities increased significantly. This resulted in a $9.9 million increase in securitized mortgage interest expense year-over-year. Growth in the Excalibur securitization program offset some of this negative variance in asset growth in securitized and commercial segment mortgages. Looking at Q2 mortgage investment income, it decreased 22% or $4.8 billion primarily due to the lower interest rate environment brought on by the pandemic.",
         "Last quarter, we discussed mortgage payment deferrals and noted that, in response to COVID-19, First National would provide qualifying borrowers with 3-month deferrals and would consider granting a second 3-month deferral in cases of extended hardship.",
         "By mid-May, the company had approved mortgage payment deferrals for about 33,800 single-family borrowers or 13.9% of eligible single-family MUA. Over by mid-July, this number has fallen to 10,473 borrowers or approximately 4.2% of the relevant MUA. About 1/4 of borrowers granted initial deferral are now requesting an extension, although many borders also rescinded their deferral arrangement before the initial 3-month period expired.",
         "Deferred mortgages are not classified as delinquent or in arrears and will not be reported to mortgage default insurers or credit bureaus. As most of the company's own exposure is due to mortgages that are insured, the increase for the company -- the issue in the company is in cash flow and generally not credit losses.",
         "From an accounting perspective, these deferred mortgages will cease to amortize, and interest otherwise payable will be capitalized to the principal of the mortgage as the mortgage balances will increase during this period.",
         "It's only where the company has securitized mortgages that it is required to fund these debt obligations. The most significant is the company's NHA MBS program. As the issuer, First National is required to make timely payments on the NHA MBS securities it is issued.",
         "Despite not having -- or receiving the payments from borrowers on the mortgages that support the NHA MBS, the company is still required to pay the interest and the amortizing principal on the debt.",
         "At June 30, 2020, this obligation has required investment by the company of about $39 million compared to about $5 million at the end of March 2020. We're hopeful that, as the economy reopens, the need for borrowers to seek mortgage deferrals will continue to dissipate.",
         "Now, here's Moray with our outlook."
      ],
      "Stephen Smith": [
         "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our call, and thank you for participating. Rob Inglis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Moray Tawse, Executive Vice President have joined me from their home offices. Well, actually we\u2019re in person our Toronto office today.",
         "I will remind you that our remarks and answers may contain forward-looking information about future events or the company\u2019s future performance. This information is subject to risks and uncertainties and should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors detailed in our MD&A.",
         "With the Bank of Canada estimating that economic activity is 15% below where it was at the end of 2019, Q2 was a challenging period for the economy. Despite this difficult background, First National staged a strong recovery from Q1, when we recorded some falloff, our first since we began using hedge accounting.",
         "Pre-fair market value income increased 42% compared to Q1 and 12% compared to in Q2 last year. Net income moved from a loss of $0.05 per common share in Q1 to a profit of $0.84 per common share in Q2. Notably, net income was ahead of Q2 last year by 14%.",
         "Strong profitability meant the after-tax dividend payout ratio against pre-fair market value income was 53% in Q2. Results of the second quarter exceeded our expectations and were driven by single-family origination growth in wider mortgage spreads. Rob will speak to spreads in his remarks.",
         "Looking at production, single-family mortgage originations were 15% or $600 million higher than a year ago. We didn't grow in all regions, but we did in our 2 largest markets. Compared to last year, single-family originations were up 32% in Ontario, our largest market; and 22% in British Columbia.",
         "This growth was more than enough to offset an 8% decline in Calgary and a 6% reduction in Montreal. We don't read too much in the single-quarter variances. But what we can say is that in all regions, the First National team did an outstanding job of responding to the needs of the mortgage broker community and the lending opportunities brokers brought to us.",
         "Our sense is that brokers have gained market. The branch and mobile sales forces of the large chartered banks meant that we have gained market share within the broker space. The efforts of our employees aided by our MERLIN underwriting system, which is the ideal solution for this time of forced physical distancing as it allows brokers to track the status of mortgage submissions in real time, online, without the need for direct underwriter contact. As well, the paperless aspect of MERLIN enables a high level of productivity for our underwriting teams.",
         "Through the first half of 2020, total single-family production, including renewals, was 28% [ph] above last year, a strong showing and an indication of a resilient housing market. On the commercial side, total production over the first half of 2020 was a record $5.7 billion, 19% above last year. This growth was achieved despite a 65% decline in conventional mortgage originations in the second quarter.",
         "This reduction was not surprising since pandemic-related risks tended to lead [ph] conventional market participants to the sidelines in Q2. Conversely, demand for insured commercial segment mortgages was strong with Q2 originations up 32% from last year. The largest part of our commercial business in the multifamily residential space for First National is the renewal of CMHC, commercial lender [ph]",
         "Our presence in both insured and conventional commercial lending markets has certainly helped First National over time. And credit goes to the commercial team for developing the expertise to serve borrowers in both product areas. As a result, mortgages under administration increased to almost 115 million -- $115 billion, a new record and 5% above last year.",
         "Overall, I would say First National has adjusted well to new realities, including working from home, and continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We continue to see this sustained across the portfolio [ph] I wish to thank First National employees across all departments, who continue to work tirelessly and with purpose to succeed during this very challenging time.",

            "Good. I just want to dive into the mortgage payment deferrals and the 4% of MUA outstanding that's still on a deferral program. Are you able to just talk through some of the rules and criteria that are in place today, how that's different from the initial program? And maybe a little bit of color as to what's driving the 4%. Is it zero payment? Is it no income, no job? What are the characteristics of the borrower in that 4%?"

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So that's a good -- that's an interesting question. I think, like most institutions -- and I find -- the program was instituted at the end of March, early April. There's a lot of misunderstanding of the program. Certainly from the government, we see a huge encouragement to go and take this deferral program. I think there was a lot of misconception that people felt what we'd given was a free throwback, that you're just making abatements. There is an element there for this charge.",
            "I think there would be a lot of people frightened at the time who get one of these. Certainly I've heard some comments on these that seem to indicate that a lot of deferrals end up bringing cash into deposits. The criteria we would have on our deferral initially would be that you would need an attestation that you had a loss of income related to COVID. You didn't have to provide any documentationor information.",
            "For the second deferral, it was that but a bit more beefed up to give people pause. We included that in the second deferral. We didn't have the resources to do the communication. But we -- if you go on the website and ask as for the information, it says we could give you but you have to have had lost income related to COVID and that there has to be supporting documentation for that.",
            "So we would think that, just our sense, and what we are going to be implementing to the extent that we can is we're going to start reaching out to a number of those holders now to see what we could do. So we spent -- has going on even before the 3 months end and get a little bit of understanding of why the least jobs aren't out and I think there's a lot of people, particularly people that took up mortgages in the last year, 18 months are feeling themselves hard on liquidity. So it's really an easy way for money to see -- essentially, for the money mortgage in your pocket. [indiscernible]",
            "So we had a sense. We don't think there's a big job loss there, but we don't have actual facts to support that. So that would be my -- that would be my sense on that. We don't see it as a problem, but I can't -- I don't have facts.",
            "What the fact we did determine actually, I think we got that from one of the mortgage insurers where they did an analysis of mortgages, and there were certainly a lot more people with mortgages taken out in the last 12 months, 18 months taking deferrals than those who've had mortgages from 4 and 5 years ago. I hope that's some help."

So let me give you just a number that we would have -- just on my head in terms of commitments. In April, they were down about 40%; May, down 10%; and June, they were up 50% compared to the same month of 2019.",
            "Our conclusion is that we are gaining share within the overall market, mortgage market, from branch and mobile sales force is probably based on new members. Sales according to CRE were up by 15%. We were very strong early in the sales market. And so with that and one the factors that -- being a 15% growth, I think one factor would be if we are gaining share perhaps within -- from our competitors in the mortgage broker channel. But I think the bigger factor would be that certainly a percentage all these bank branches are closed.",
            "The -- a lot of people bank where they work. Not as many people going into work anymore. And so a lot of the branch origination channel was disrupted. And banks are all the same. I mean [indiscernible] So that would be our sense.",
            "So sales before the COVID period, no. That's -- that wouldn't be really a factor. We had quite a very strong March. But the numbers we've seen June of those, I don't know the number off the top of my head, but percentage of sales was high. I mean it was high and in line other periods"

How do you -- how are you looking at -- or what's your thoughts on it right now? Obviously, it's hard to say for sure, but I mean, does it feel like as we enter the fall and we kind of get out of peak housing season that things will taper off from a seasonality standpoint but maybe still stay strong in terms of the overall housing market recovery? Or do you think that there is some temporal reasons for what we're seeing right now and, as we enter the fall, things may maybe fall off a little bit more than usual given the situation we find ourselves in?"

Whether we'll get a higher percentage, we hope, of what's available in the marketplace, you can't really tell what the market is going to be like. But if COVID stays like it is and branches stay shut down, we see that as a strong advantage for our product."

            "We're really in uncharted territory. I would say that, within First National, this analysis of the shift from branches only really dawned on us, probably when we saw the June real estate sales. And I would have said -- during June, we would have said it's pent-up demand. Like if you do you think the sale -- if you looked at March, pre COVID, they were a record commitment period for First National and everyone else. And that was starting to have remnants of the bubble or the frenetic crisis of 2017 that started that. So there's certainly pent-up demand. So here, breaking our questions to 2 things. Where the real estate market is going, we don't know. There's certainly pent-up demand, and I think that had a factor applying to sustained sales which were 15% over June '19. The pent-up demand and the sales didn't take place in April, part of May.",
            "How that's going to play, I don't know that we know. I mean that sort of the million-dollar question. We don't know. One starts to have to think that as the economy slows down, that's going to be -- have an impact. But the other factor is, we're grappling with, we see is, I think we're coming to conclusion based on what we're seeing on our numbers. Certainly in June, what we're seeing this month in sales and what we hear what we hear on The Street with respect to how the branch channels are doing, where we seem to be picking up share, and to Moray's point, I think I could see that lasting. And just if you think of it anecdotally, if you just think about those stories that people have -- they have to go into a branch. There's lineups. It's difficult. Where do you bank? We do a lot of people bank? A lot of people bank where they work. If -- I would say we tend to go walk down the stairs or walk across the street to be in their branch to get a mortgage. We're not doing that now. And I think is the opportunity where the realtor is saying, well, you can't go into your branch or you can't -- look, I'll put you in touch with a broker. They'll deal with you over the phone or -- and you can do -- use that arrangement. So it's a point of differentiation. So it's new. It's new and it's different."

Certainly, the ABCP program is very indicative that noise is disappearing. So we would -- and in many ways, but -- the -- our results are very much -- I think the influence -- the biggest factor here, Geoff, which in addition to the larger volumes we see continuing, would also be the wider spread.",

And what we're seeing is we're getting these large volumes out of the wider spreads. These volumes can reduce spreads by 20 basis - 20, 25 basis points wider, it is why they're a big impact."

So if we sell on an institution, we get the gain on sale, and that's not going on in here.",

So in -- we think the government came in and offered to buy BAs from the bank, but SEDAR went down to 52 basis points for May 1. That was like a 1-month issue.
