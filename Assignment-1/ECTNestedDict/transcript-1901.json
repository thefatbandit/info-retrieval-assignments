      "John Buran": [
         "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2020 earnings call. I will start out by reiterating that our thoughts continue to go out to those most affected by COVID-19, especially the brave health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic. The health and welfare of our employees and customers remain our highest priority. I want to thank our employees, particularly for their outstanding work as we continue to successfully navigate through these unprecedented times.",
         "On today\u2019s call, I will discuss our second quarter highlights as well as provide an update on decisive actions that we\u2019ve taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and current economic environment. Then our CFO, Susan Cullen, will provide greater detail on our financial performance and credit quality. Following our prepared remarks, we will address your questions along with our Chief Real Estate Lending Officer, Frank Korzekwinski.",
         "Starting on Slide 3. I\u2019m proud of how our team has responded with adaptability and flexibility since March. We were quick to respond to the pandemic with new health and safety measures, which are still in place today, including appointment banking, and expansion of remote capabilities to nearly all team members. We continue to actively support our customers. At June 30, 2020, as a result of COVID-19, we have acted forbearance on loans with a principal balance of approximately $1.3 billion.",
         "We have begun to see loans that have been granted forbearance start to return to making regularly scheduled loan payments as total forbearances are down from our intra-quarter peak. Through July 10, 63% of the $146 million of loans scheduled to return to regularly scheduled payments have done so. Additionally, we\u2019ve actively participated in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program, originating $93 million of these loans. We are one of nine banks in the state of New York, participating in the Main Street Lending Program and also a proud participant in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York\u2019s Small Business Recovery Grant Program, helping our customers and communities navigate through the current environment.",
         "During this pandemic, our customers have utilized our enhanced technology platform with improved mobile and online banking capabilities that went live in March. Mobile deposits have increased over 13% from April through June. Similarly, the usage of ATMs has increased, with over 75% of all transactions now completed via ATM. The number of accounts enrolling in online banking and opening new accounts online has grown during the current quarter to 19% of retail account openings.",
         "With that, let me now turn to Slide 4 to provide a summary of our strong second quarter operating results. Our second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.63 per diluted common share were positively impacted by two items. First, we achieved record net interest income as a result of our quick response to the Fed decreasing interest rates in late March, resulting in cost of funds decreasing 62 basis points from the prior quarter, with additional opportunity to further reduce funding costs in the third quarter.",
         "Adding to the reduction of cost of funds in the second quarter, core deposits increased 7%, while net interest margin expanded 43 basis points from the previous quarter. The second item positively affecting our GAAP earnings was the noncash fair value adjustment to our junior subordinated debt of $10 million or $0.27 per diluted common share after tax due to market conditions. Excluding this fair value adjustment, core earnings for the quarter totaled $10 million or $0.36 per diluted common share. Pre-provision, pretax net revenue totaled $34 million, an increase of $28 million from the previous quarter.",
         "Positively, credit quality remains one of our key strengths. Nonperforming assets at the end of the quarter were 29 basis points. Our total loan portfolio is 88% collateralized by real estate with an average loan-to-value of less than 40%. Despite the current economic environment due to COVID-19, we have a long history and foundation built upon disciplined underwriting, good credit quality and a resilient seasoned loan portfolio with strong asset protection.",
         "At the end of the second quarter, we adjusted our economic forecast in CECL model, resulting in a provision for credit losses of $9.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share after tax. Our allowance for credit losses stands at 61 basis points of gross loans and 182% of nonperforming loans. Our maximum charge-offs were only 64 basis points in the midst of the Great Recession, while industry peak charge-offs were nearly five times our experience.",
         "As previously disclosed, our pending acquisition of Empire Bancorp was delayed due to severe instability and volatility in the U.S. financial and stock markets caused by the pandemic. The company continues to believe that the merger offers benefits to both shareholders and customers of Flushing and Empire. We will not be making any additional comments on this pending acquisition.",
         "Overall, we made good progress in the second quarter to achieve our strategic objectives. We managed our cost of funds and continued to improve the funding mix. We increased net interest income. We enhanced core earnings power. We managed credit risk, and we remain well capitalized under all stress test scenarios. Importantly, we remain committed to building and fostering an environment of diversity and inclusion in our workforce and the communities we serve. In light of recent events, we formed a diversity and inclusion committee chaired by the Executive Vice President of Human Resources, reporting directly to me. The role of this committee is to make recommendations ensuring Flushing Financial continues to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all employees and to ensure our message of inclusion is supported by our actions and participation in community organizations.",
         "Turning to Slide 5. Looking at quarter end data, loan growth was 6% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter as major categories of multifamily and business loans showed improvement. Core yields on loans decreased by 23 basis points quarter-over-quarter. This, however, was more than offset by our improvement in deposit costs, which improved 69 basis points from the prior quarter. Helping to drive that improvement was a 19% increase in our noninterest bearing accounts.",
         "Slide 6 provides detail on the forbearances that we granted due to the pandemic. As of the end of June, these amounted to approximately 21% of the loan portfolio. 97% of these loans are secured by real estate with an average loan-to-value of 45%. Less than half of our forbearances are in more stressed industries like retail or hotels that have been closed down but are just now beginning to open up. The remainder of our forbearances include multifamily, medical offices, other general commercial real estate that we judge more prone to a quicker recovery.",
         "Slide 7 details the impact of COVID-19 on our commercial real estate retail customers. Our portfolio seems to be stabilizing as many tenants were able to operate at some capacity during the lockdown. As we have previously discussed, our portfolio has limited exposure to national chains, as New York entered phases two and three of reopening, shopping centers and strip malls were opening up. Recently, we inspected 42% of the retail outlet properties across the portfolio, noting that they all appear to be well maintained and the stores appeared to be well stocked.",
         "On Slide 8, we describe our detailed approach to the COVID-19 loan forbearance process. We have a team of independent lenders to monitor the progress of the loans granted forbearance. Early results of our approach are 63% of the $146 million in loans scheduled to return through regularly scheduled payments have done so. And these results also indicate that borrowers are working with their tenants to stabilize operations in the retail sector.",
         "With that, let me now turn the call over to Susan to provide additional details on our financial performance and asset quality.",
         "Thank you, Susan. On Slide 19, I\u2019ll conclude by summarizing how we plan to continue to execute our strategic objectives to come out of this pandemic in an even stronger position. I remain incredibly proud of what all our team members have been able to do since March. We continue to play an essential role in supporting our communities and customers\u2019 financial needs.",
         "Our balance sheet capital and liquidity going into this environment was strong, and our positive core earnings power provides a good base to absorb future credit losses. Stress testing indicates our ability to sustain material credit costs over a multiyear horizon, if necessary. Our consistent credit discipline has served us well coming into this economic environment, and we\u2019ll continue to stay close to our clients and manage our loan portfolio prudently.",
         "Our ongoing focus on developing and maintaining a multilingual branch staff to serve our diverse New York City customers remains a key differentiator. The New York City market and its strong Asian customer base continue to represent a significant opportunity for us over the long term. We\u2019ll continue to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all employees and customers. The investment in the Universal Banker model in our branches has been critical to our capability to serve our customers in this environment, along with our enhanced digital capabilities.",
         "As a result of this current experience as the restrictive economic environment eventually lifts, we will have a workforce that is more capable, flexible and dynamic, coupled with the customer base that is increasingly attuned to our online and mobile banking capabilities.",
         "In conclusion, we will remain focused on maintaining strong capital, liquidity and asset quality, while also controlling the expenses and managing our net interest margin to come out of this pandemic an even stronger and more resilient company.",
         "With that, we will now open it up for questions. Operator, I\u2019ll turn it over to you."

         "Welcome to Flushing Financial Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Hosting the call today are John Buran, President and Chief Executive Officer; Susan Cullen, Senior Executive Vice President, Treasurer, and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Korzekwinski, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief of Real Estate Lending.",
         "Today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] A copy of the earnings press release and slide presentation that the company will be referencing today are available on its investor relations website at flushingbank.com.",
         "Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that discussions during this call contain forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

         "During this call, references will be made to non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with the U.S. GAAP.

         "I\u2019d now like to introduce John Buran, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of strategy and results. Please go ahead."
      ],
      "Susan Cullen": [
         "Thank you, John. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 9. Nonperforming loans totaled $20 million, which is 34 basis points of gross loans, and we charged-off $1 million for the quarter. Loan-to-value on real estate dependent loans amounted to 38% as of June 30, and the average loan-to-value for nonperforming loans collateralized by real estate was 30%.",
         "As detailed on Slide 10, we believe the credit outlook for the company is well controlled. The company has a strong credit history and an active forbearance program. Our forbearances have declined 13% from the intra period peak of $1.5 billion. The loan portfolio remains 88% collateralized by real estate and loans delinquent greater than 90 days amount to 32 basis points of gross loans. As John noted, New York is beginning to open up, resulting in a decrease in the forbearance requests.",
         "Slide 11 shows 90-day delinquencies as a percentage of loans originated by year. Our credit discipline has remained consistent for the past 10 years as we\u2019ve tightened the underwriting criteria back in 2009. As a result, in the last 10 vintage years, we have only 17 loans 90-day plus delinquent.",
         "Continuing on Slide 12. As good as our credit discipline has been, we\u2019ve recognized continued uncertainty, so we recorded a provision for credit losses of nearly $10 million for the second quarter, primarily driven by deteriorating economic conditions resulting from the impact of COVID-19.",
         "The allowance evaluation as of June 30, the forecast showed a tough economy with elevated unemployment and decreasing GDP. We continue to use the Oxford economic forecast model. This model assumes that it will take three quarters for our losses to return to the historic norms. Our credit discipline has served us well coming into this environment, and we\u2019ll continue to stay close to our customers and manage that carefully, including loan forbearances as appropriate.",
         "As highlighted on Slide 13, our coverage ratio has improved significantly since the 2008 financial crisis. Our solid credit quality metrics have resulted in our coverage ratio increasing to 182% as of June 30, 2020, from 28% at December 31, 2008. The loan-to-value on our real estate portfolio at quarter end totaled a modest 38%. Importantly, we continue to underwrite each loan using a cap rate in excess of 5% and stress test each loan. Additionally, current underwriting requires an interest reserve for a minimum of six months for most credits.",
         "On Slide 14, we note our charge-offs during the Great Recession were significantly lower than the industry. We continue to actively manage our loan portfolios to identify and resolve problem loans recording charge-offs early in the delinquency process. We are a historical seller of nonperforming loans. As we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, we are mindful of maintaining asset quality. As shown here, over two decades, we have demonstrated superior credit metrics with industry net charge-offs averaging seven times our net charge-offs since 2000. As John noted, our maximum charge-offs were 64 basis points in the midst of the Great Recession, while industry peak charge-offs were nearly five times then.",
         "Slide 15 shows the trend in the record net interest income recognized this quarter. The net interest margin increased 43 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 42 basis points year-over-year. The increase in the net interest income was primarily due to the decrease in the cost of funds of 62 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 91 basis points year-over-year.",
         "On Slide 16, we provide an update to our balance sheet strategy to reduce funding cost to support our NIM. We have approximately $800 million of retail CDs scheduled to mature through the second quarter of 2021 at a weighted average cost of 1.4%. As shown on the right-hand side, current replacement funding costs are significantly lower than maturing CD rates. And we are using wholesale markets to strategically reduce the cost of funds. We believe there\u2019s protection to limit the downward pressure on asset yields.",
         "As described on Slide 17, approximately 20% of the real estate portfolio reprices annually and there are floors associated with individual loans. The floating rate loan portfolio totaling $589 million already reflects the downward pricing, absent any additional rate fluctuations.",
         "Moving to Slide 18. Noninterest expense decreased $4 million or 11% quarter-over-quarter, and the efficiency ratio was 55% compared to 68% last quarter. The ratio of noninterest expense to average assets decreased to 1.6% for the second quarter of 2020. The company has historically maintained a relatively stable ratio of noninterest expense to average assets. Included in the noninterest expenses are $0.2 million of legal expenses related to the Empire merger.",
         "Continuing to manage expenses and improve the NIM will assist us in achieving our lower efficiency ratio. As always, we\u2019re focused on continuous improvement and look for more opportunities with efficiency gains given our enhanced ability to serve our customers and work remotely. Regarding taxes for 2020, we approximate an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to John for some closing comments."

            "I wanted to start asking about NII and NIM. Obviously, really big improvement sequentially this quarter, really impressive how you guys have kind of offset the cost of funds. Maybe just some thoughts on going forward sort of the magnitude of the opportunity. I would guess, like we\u2019re not going to see a repeat at this level. And I think kind of the context I\u2019m looking at is on the Q1 presentation, you have disclosed $390 million of CDs rolling off in Q2. And then on the slide in this quarter, looks like the magnitude is a bit smaller going forward. Is that the right way to think about that?"

         "Speaker": "Steve Comery"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. That is the right way to think about it. We had some specials, I believe, runoff. But the magnitude that we\u2019d be looking at, as we\u2019ve detailed on Slide 16, is we have this $800 million worth of CDs over the next four quarters that will be maturing, plus the ability to continue to reprice any non-time deposits. We have the borrowing capabilities, it\u2019s around 18 basis points in some of our funding sources. So, we believe there\u2019s some movement available in the \u2013 on the liability side of the NIM margin \u2013 of the NIM equation, excuse me."

      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. So, should I read that as the trajectory of NIM should generally be upward going forward then?"

         "Speaker": "Steve Comery"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I think all of the things being equal as long as assets are \u2013 remain consistent with what our projections are. And we do think we\u2019ve got a fair amount of stability. We don\u2019t have an expectation that the Fed is going to make another move downwards. So that\u2019s built into our thoughts in this regard. 20% of the loan portfolio reprices annually. We don\u2019t really expect much in the way of the floating rate portfolio, which is about 500 \u2013 between $500 million and $600 million to reprice downward unless there\u2019s a change in Fed rates.",
            "So given that level of, let\u2019s say, semi stability on the asset side, and given the opportunity that we have on the funding side, that Susan just outlined, I think we\u2019re in good shape to see some expansion of NIM with those qualifications that I just mentioned."

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, very helpful. And then I think kind of on the same subject. So you mentioned the significant inflows to non-interest bearing accounts. Kind of wondering what the underlying customer behavior is there? Or like customers looking to keep more liquidity, because they\u2019re less certain about what\u2019s going on. Then if that\u2019s the case, what are your expectations for how sticky those accounts will be?"

      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So, some of it is obviously, PPP, and the rest of it, I think, is just a general focus on liquidity and also our ability to open up accounts during the pandemic, which, although down from historical levels has been more oriented toward DDA."

So I mean, I guess just maybe like for context, do you have some like indication as to what the levels were like in previous quarters?"

And we\u2019ve been working this for a while, but it really wasn\u2019t until we brought in our new online account opening capabilities that we started to see some activity. And that\u2019s been a gradual increase since March.",
            "So, customers are telling us that our online banking account opening process has been very, very, very good and easy to use. We\u2019ve had comments from customers about the \u2013 about our deposit-only card being very successful for business customers. There\u2019s a lot of good things happening here that I think are just beginning to take place. We also used to have probably \u2013 well, right now, 90% of all of our customers who open accounts with us online do not have any human intervention at all. So those are going right through within minutes. Those account openings are taking place right through in minutes as opposed to having a substantial proportion going through a manual fraud control, which is what we had in the past. So, the capabilities that we put in place are significantly upgraded."

We have the extended unemployment benefits, running out \u2013 PPP funds are obviously going to run out in many cases. I guess just sort of like what areas are you guys like most focused on with \u2013 as we go forward, assuming there isn\u2019t like substantial additional stimulus, I guess, like what are the kind of the main credit focus areas?"

            "Hello, Steve. In the process requests for assistance started to come back in April, mid-March and early April. We set up \u2013 immediately set up a special team to manage the process of helping with the requests, so that we can streamline the process, provide timely response and try to get the relief that some of our customers had requested or were seeking at that particular time. It was a little bit challenging through early March and April. I mean, that was the peak season for the request for assistance.",
            "So, our team has been in place since probably early April, and they are communicating with our customers on a regular basis. We have especially e-mail boxes set up that we\u2019re receiving interim financial statements, rent rolls, rent collection reports and helping them get back to the payment status that they had prior to COVID-19. So far, the initial response have been rather favorable.",
            "It appears as though March and April were the dark periods where requests were made, I guess, under dire circumstances or perceived dire circumstances. And I believe we saw \u2013 now that we\u2019re coming off some of these relief plans, we saw that a number of customers probably were borderline scenarios for assistance, but the plans that we provided did enable them to build up cash so that they could return to a normal payment status sooner than later. Our overall assessment in the beginning was \u2013 having to look back is that there was a little bit of a hoarding of cash going on in the marketplace as many property owners really weren\u2019t sure how long this shutdown of the economy was going to last."

            "So, I think over the long term, clearly, we think that we\u2019re going to be a much more efficient operation, given the emergence of our online capabilities. I think that is going to grow over time. I can\u2019t give you any specifics in that regard. But we do know that things like appointment banking have worked very, very well. We\u2019ve enhanced our phone service. We\u2019ve enhanced our video capabilities at the ATM level. So, we\u2019ve had a significant increase in customers who\u2019ve come in and have basically been serviced not by human being face-to-face, but a human being via our video capabilities off of the ATMs.",
            "So, while I think it\u2019s too early to start to speculate about what the opportunities are, but clearly, they are many and not the least of which is the ability of people to work remotely and \u2013 which has been a real strength of the company. Just every aspect of our business, from audit right through to account opening, has been functioning very, very well in a totally remote environment, and we expect opportunities to come out of that. I think one of them clearly, is the ability to get more geographic spread out of our individual branch locations.",
            "Clearly, 20 branches is not a lot to have in the New York metropolitan area. But I also think that the number of branches that we want to have over the time \u2013 over the next five years or so is down considerably from what we ordinarily would have needed to provide the maximum amount of outreach to customers just because we have this additional capability. So, I think there\u2019s more to come on that, and \u2013 but I\u2019m very optimistic that we\u2019ve really made a significant change in our capabilities. We brought in some of the best technology that we could find from MANTL, for example, Q2 and Synechron that is really, really helping us to build out our business. We expect to have an online escrow system towards the end of the year. So, there\u2019s a lot of additional enhancements that we\u2019re making in our product offerings to customers."

So John, you had pointed out, obviously, that part of the noninterest-bearing deposit increase this quarter was related to the PPP loans. Do you have a sense of how those deposits or how you\u2019re thinking those deposits are going to trend from here in terms of the borrowers within the PPP program, their desire to use those funds?"

But given that most of our PPP was to customers, I don\u2019t know that a significant portion of our increase is coming from PPP. I think it\u2019s a factor, but I think a lot of what we\u2019re seeing is customers\u2019 desire to have more liquidity available to them. And I don\u2019t see that changing at least in the near future \u2013 well into 2021 until there\u2019s some changes in the economic environment."

One is, Susan, you mentioned the Oxford economic forecast. Can you just give us what some of the assumptions you all made within that \u2013 to get to that $8.6 million of reserve build related to COVID?"
