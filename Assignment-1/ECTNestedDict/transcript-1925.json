      "Mike Kandell": [
         "Thank you, Kay. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings call. ",
         "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone on the call that our remarks today could include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. The company\u2019s forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and assumptions regarding the company\u2019s business and performance, the economy and other future conditions and forecasts of future events, circumstances and results.",
         "Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the actual results. Important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those in its forward-looking statements include those risk factors set forth in the company's 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and our 2020 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.",
         "The company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or otherwise.",
         "Also, we want to point out that in addition to GAAP information, we will provide information relating to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP or adjusted measures provides additional meaningful information to investors, which reflect how management views the business. Detailed reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are set forth in a reconciliation table in our press release issued earlier today and furnished with the Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Tim Whelan, our Chief Executive Officer.",
         "Thank you, Tim.",
         "Good morning again, everyone. Before I begin, I wanted to highlight that effective June 30, 2020. We are reporting as one operating segment in our financial statements. This was the result of internal reorganizations that have occurred over the prior six months, as well as an internal analysis of how key operating decisions are made by our Chief Operating decision maker Tim Whalen.",
         "We will continue to provide revenue and gross profit by product group, as we believe these are key performance indicators for our investors. Our product groups are as follows: Test and Measurement solutions or T&M is comprised primarily of the Boonton, Noisecom and Holzworth businesses. RF component or RFC is comprised primarily of our Microlab business, and Radio, Baseband and Software or RBS is comprised primarily of CommAgility.",
         "Consolidated revenues for the second quarter 2020 were $11.1 million, which was a decrease of $2.4 million or 17.8% from the second quarter of 2019. Revenue in our RBS product group decreased $4 million due to lower demand for our digital signal processing hardware cards. This was offset partially by sales of our higher margin LTE software licenses in the quarter.",
         "Revenue in the T&M product group increased $1.3 million due to the contribution of $1.9 million of revenue in the second quarter from our Holzworth acquisition. This offset declines in Boonton and Noisecom of $600,000 from the prior year period, due primarily to the impacts of the COVID pandemic on customer spending. Revenue in the RFC product group increased $300,000 from the prior year period due to shipments from our components in the quarter related to two large projects.",
         "Consolidated gross profit decreased $500,000 on lower revenue as compared to the prior year. Consolidated gross profit margin increased from 45.4% to 51% primarily due to the RBS product group as Q2, 2020 included higher margin LTE software license sales versus lower margin hardware sales in the prior year.",
         "Gross profit margin in RFC product group increased from 43.1% to 46.2% due to cost savings initiatives, including headcount reductions, and material cost savings. T&M gross profit margin decreased from 55.6% to 52.9%, due primarily to $114,000 non-cash purchase accounting adjustment related to marking the Holzworth inventory to fair value at acquisition.",
         "Turning to operating expenses our Q2, 2020 operating expenses include a full quarter of Holzworth expenses, which are offset by expense reduction initiatives that we implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2020. These included headcount and benefit reductions, travel and other discretionary spending reductions.",
         "Consolidated R&D expenses increased $176,000 due to the inclusion of Holzworth R&D expenses of $156,000 an increase third-party spend of $200,000 primarily on our 5G product development. This was offset by expense reductions of approximately $180,000 from the prior year period.",
         "Consolidated sales and marketing expenses decreased $366,000 primarily due to reductions in headcount, commissions and marketing spend, which were partially offset by the inclusion of Holzworth sales and marketing expenses of 300,000.",
         "And general and administrative expenses decreased $70,000 as expense reductions related to professional fees, intangible asset amortization expense and other discretionary spending was offset by the inclusion of Holzworth general and administrative expenses of $200,000.",
         "Overall, consolidated operating expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were $5.7 million, which is a decrease of approximately $300,000 from the year ago period. At a high level, this breaks down as follows: Holzworth contributed approximately $600,000 in operating expenses in the quarter, which was offset by approximately $900,000 in reductions in operating expenses from the prior year period.",
         "Interest expense increased approximately $200,000 from the prior year period due to interest expense on our new term loan facility used to finance the Holzworth acquisition. Our net loss for the quarter was $700,000 as compared to net income of $200,000 in the prior year period.",
         "Decreases due to lower revenues and higher interest expense only partially offset by lower operating expenses. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $794,000 as compared to $1.1 million in the prior year period.",
         "Turning to the balance sheet consolidated cash as of June 30, 2020, was $2.9 million. Availability under our asset base revolver was $5 million and gross debt was $10.7 million. Included in our gross debt is $2 million related to the paycheck protection program loan which we received on May 4.",
         "As of mid July, all of the proceeds of the PPP loan have been spent on qualified expenses as defined under the PPP program. The company expects to apply for forgiveness of the loan in the fourth quarter.",
         "At this time, I'd like to turn it back over to Tim for some closing remarks."

      "Operator": [
         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Wireless Telecom Group Q2 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions and comments after the presentation.",
         "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mike Kandell. Sir, the floor is yours."
      ],
      "Tim Whelan": [
         "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.",
         "Before we begin, I'd like to once again express to everyone our best wishes for continued health and safety, as well as thank our employees for their incredible resilience and spirit. We have returned to operations teams to full schedules from a staggered regimen, while maintaining the increased distancing and health measures in our facilities.",
         "Our operations teams, engineers, customer facing sales and sales support teams all continue to focus on our mission and values, driving the business forward and taking good care of our customers.",
         "During this incredible period of time, the importance and mission criticality of wireless communication and connectivity has never been more apparent. And our focus enabling the development, testing and deployment of specialized solutions continues to hold tremendous value to our customers. We are incredibly proud of how our employees have made the workplace adjustments needed to contribute to our mission and we are so thankful for their dedication.",
         "Turning to our Q2 performance, our results reflect sequential improvement from the first quarter of this year, including revenue growth, gross margin improvement, as well as improvements to operating margins and EBITDA. As compared to the same quarter a year ago, our revenues of $11.1 million reflect increases in RF Component revenues, increased software revenue, and better than expected performance and our newly acquired Holzworth business, which offset the expected declines in hardware parts sales.",
         "They are also beginning to reflect the benefits of our revised go-to-market strategy, where we are leveraging a combined sales approach to pursue improved cross selling opportunities, as well as greater resource allocations to our advancing 5G product portfolio.",
         "Additionally, as we highlighted in the press release, we are excited about signing two new software contracts in the second quarter, one of which is our first 5G customers on the NXP platform. Together, they represent approximately $1 million of software contract value before any incremental service engagements or future royalties should their end applications and deployments reach scale over the next several years.",
         "Our second quarter results reflect revenue recognition of approximately 600,000 of the contract value of these two software contracts, and the remainder is expected to be recognized over the next few quarters.",
         "One of these contracts included our 4G LTE software for a rail application, and the second represents a 5G application on the NXP platform for 5G small cell deployments. We are very happy with a growing funnel of potential customers focused on 5G and leveraging our NXP collaboration. And we expect we will sign additional software contracts with the other new customers before the year is out.",
         "Our gross margins also improved in the second quarter, and they improved sequentially as well as for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to the same period of last year. This improvement to over 50% gross margin was driven by the inclusion of higher software revenue, the inclusion of higher margin Holzworth revenues, and cost reductions in our core operations, which decrease cost of sales. Combined with lower operating expenses, we were able to show sequentially improved operating margins and EBITDA and Mike will go through our numbers in greater detail in a moment.",
         "With regard to our Q2 order flow, we realize bookings of $12.4 million in the quarter, resulting in a second consecutive quarter of increased bookings and end of quarter backlog as we head into the second half of the year. Our backlog at June 30 of $6.2 million is higher by 2.4 million or 63%, compared to December 31. The bookings included early success integrating the Holzworth business, as well as our two new software customers.",
         "With regard to our total addressable market expectations for the Radio, Baseband and Software product, our Q2 success with two new customers reinforces our view this is a large and growing market. We estimate the size of this market is $750 million and growing between 12% and 18% compounded annual growth rate.",
         "Our strengths continue to extend to specialized deployments for private network needs, that we are starting to see greater market opportunity potentially emerge as we continue to invest in our R&D roadmap.",
         "We are an important technology building block for current and emerging 4G and 5G applications. More exacting estimates of the size of the opportunity and growth will take more time to develop and define, but the markets we're focused on currently include 4G and 5G applications in transportation, the military and government, satellite communications in certain small cell applications.",
         "We also continue to see that COVID-19 continues to create uncertainty. And we have seen project delays and cancellations caused by inaccessible project sites, canceled sport seasons and conventions, and project funding changes.",
         "Additionally, shifts to virtual trade shows have also challenged new opportunity identification. We have also realized a decrease in our distributor orders enter stocking levels, as they have taken a more conservative view of their balance sheets.",
         "With that said, we continue to see our RF Component funnels replenish where we typically have less long-term visibility. And we continue to see growth in our test and measurement funnel, as well as growth in the Radio, Baseband and Software funnels where there are longer cycles of evaluation and investments. We expect to see the realization of contract wins in the second half, based on funnel increases in the first half.",
         "With regard to our strategic measurements, new product introduction and our R&D efforts, we are pleased with our progress in the first half of the year. In the last six months, we announced seven new product releases or launches, which included two new software releases new ultra-wideband RF Components for network densification of mid-band spectrum, and two new power meter advancements to address WiFi 6 and flexible form factors.",
         "We also announced two customer project engagements including Raymond James Stadium and SoFi stadium. We announced our partnership collaboration with NXP, as well as two releases announcing a Frost & Sullivan Product Leadership Award, as well as an announcement showcasing our capabilities enabling 4G and 5G satellite communications.",
         "In June, we also announced the shift in our go-to-market strategy. And last week, we announced we added a highly qualified industry veteran from Xilinx to our executive team as our Chief Revenue Officer.",
         "And for the three months ending June 30, we have realized our improved gross margin target of over 50% driven primarily by the inclusion of higher margin products, which are in large part due to the result of our software R&D investments and our acquisitions.",
         "So netting it out, we believe the company's long-term strategic positioning has strengthened in the last six months. We are seeing traction and we are accomplishing promising milestones for revenue growth and improved profitability ahead. We still have a lot of work to do. But we remain confident in our strategic focus on long-term themes of growth, including network densification, 5G investment and satellite communication.",
         "This optimism is balanced by near-term concerns over the uncertain impact of COVID-19 on the rest of the year, including the difficulty in predicting the timing and close of the funnel of opportunities and the revenue recognition process.",
         "With that, I am going to turn the call over to Mike to walk us through the financials.",
         "Thank you, Mike.",
         "With regard to future outlook and financial expectations, while we are very pleased with the strategic goals we have accomplished in the first half of the year, there is still too much uncertainty to provide estimates of expectations for the year. The impact of COVID-19 on our funnel and backlog continues to be unexpected and sporadic. And the forward-looking information and project timing is very fluid, challenging reasonable levels of predictability.",
         "We are highly excited about our strategic direction and future. We've built the larger company to address the mission critical needs across the development, test and deployment lifecycle of wireless communication. We have invested and focused on three important themes of long-term growth and improved profitability. We are an essential business serving the critical needs of our customers and we are an important provider in the defense industrial base.",
         "Our employees are engaged and motivated, and the leadership team is energized, excited and empowered to drive success. As always, our employees were being in health will be a top priority. And their safety will continue to guide our decisions as we continue to navigate the challenges presented by the pandemic.",
         "Thank you and Kate, if you could please open the lines for questions."

Although the initial 5G mass market deployments are still being done in a very focused environment and so they'll deploy those to the specific applications that we're designing for them. And that requires higher level of frequency and bandwidth and power. And then once they get deployed to market they'll be tested extensively by carriers. And if their solution is ultimately what those carriers want it will be deployed in much greater numbers in the years 2023 and beyond."

I know he is obviously very new and fresh, but clearly there must be a strategy around of what we're looking from him to as far as leading the sales force and kind of repositioning our sales and marketing team?"

I do think it's early stages, if he were on the call, I think would be a little early stage just one week into this to be declaring any shifts or changes. He is incredibly excited by what he has seen through the process of betting in recruitment. He is excited to dig in. We're excited to tap into his network of opportunities that could potentially continue to grow our funnel.",
            "He is incredibly adept at designing solutions, familiarity with the silicon solutions. There is a common network of names at customers and the technology providers that are known to us and him. So we're just incredibly excited that he has got the right expertise, the right energy, the right network, the right connections, and he'll help drive this forward.",
            "But I think we'll need to give him 30 days to accomplish this first 30-day mission. There are a number of tasks that will need to be done there. And then of course, there is 100-day plan. So we'll certainly be talking more about this going forward, Michael, I think it should maybe just a little bit early right now."

            "Robert Morrison, [Blinc Capital]. Congratulations on a good quarter guys. I think we have at least the beginnings of a substantive turnaround occurring. The Holzworth acquisition looks as if it's off to a decent start. Can you give us some granularity on how revenue synergies are progressing there? And also at the same time, the legacy businesses seem to have struggled a little bit do you have anything going there to reignite growth in those businesses? Thank you."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Robert Morrison"
      },
      "32": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Thank you, Robert. So first part of the question was asking about Holzworth, you may recall that that was a business that had approximately $5 million of revenue in previous periods. You will note that from the numbers might call it out there, they're above that in terms of the first half, if you think about that, not that their businesses run rate or it's a - we'll have identical revenue every quarter.",
            "But in the first half of the year, they're above that threshold to get to above $5 million, which is of course where we set the targets. So right off the bat, they're meeting those expectations, but the order flow is well beyond our expectations and we believe that our presence has accelerated.",
            "So with regards to synergy, we have a bigger platform. We have more reps, and we have qualified vendor approval at certain firms that was more that they were not approved that and that's accelerated improved some of the flow of purchase orders.",
            "So we're just thrilled with how well they are doing everything that we expected, where our customers are pleased that we're bringing more technology solutions to them.

This joint venture seems to be a step up in collaboration between you and the silicon provider. Can you just give us some granularity on the amount of resources and efforts they're putting into this?

And that's based upon a standard architecture. We bring the five-layer to bear. And so, that distinguishes us from others. We have other layers of software.",

And then there are other software providers that can bring applications depending on what the end application is.",

And really what Tim has been talking about is we're looking at growth on the software license and services side of CommAgility, which is at a much higher margin than the hardware cards.",

And so, while we were collaborating with this customer, and we're aware of this, the projections of declines happened at a different slope over a period of many years.",

We've seen those numbers each and every quarter. We do expect them to continue purchasing hardware cards from us potentially in the second half of the year, but they will be at levels much lower than previous periods.",

Have we - is there a go-to-market strategy where we are now offering an entire I guess, test and measurement solution?"

We've been through a number of rounds of training and webinars through our channels and our manufacturer rep partners. They are also getting excited and they're also positioning Holzworth at third customer basis.",

And that will be the final element. But otherwise the sales teams have come together, sales teams have been cross trained, the rest have been cross trained, and we continue to put out demand generation activities and marketing that covers the full suite of products."

            "That's hard to say, Michael, I think that they were positioned with a few larger opportunities that our combination helped them get over the line would be one point of reflection on your question. A second point of reflection on your question is that they are they're focused on some lab, some 80 upgrades at semiconductors, those large semiconductors are located all over the world. So they're less impacted by a regional lab, which is where we saw Boonton get impacted by.",

We're talking about deals that can be identified on one hand that if they all come over the line, it creates a search for one brand. And if a handful of deals get slowed, it creates with the client for the other."

I noticed the accounts receivable would be boosted, I assume price some of theirs. And I'm just trying to find out if you think there is an ability to pay down debt from that transaction, because I think you've stated that as a goal for this year and what type of debt pay down, you might be able to achieve from both operating cash flow and working down the non-cash current assets? Thank you."

So the pay - ultimate pay down will be determined based upon that excess cash flow calculation. AR has increased primarily due to Holzworth also just some timing. We had a lot of shipments at the very end of the quarter.",
            "I think for the year, our cash flow again is going to be dependent on our performance in the second half of the year, specifically at CommAgility. We also have some CapEx needs in the second half. We really pulled back in CapEx in the first half of the year, but with some of the 5G development, we're going to have to spend some additional dollars on CapEx, which should you know, drive down some of the cash flow in the second half of the year."

We've been very selective in what we've taken out of R&D, and that's helped offset some third party spend that we've had to do for specifically our 5G product developments. So you'll see that we had an increase year-over-year in third party spend for the quarter of about 200,000 and for the year up about 300,000. You know, because of the specifically the 5G product development, and I would expect that trend to continue in the second half of the year.",

But if you look back to '18 and '17, I think we would want to be back at that percentage of revenue going forward, but in the short-term, we're going to continue to have some third party spend specifically as it relates to 5G roadmap."

I don't see a lot of pleasure in the new product introduction results for the past couple of years. So I'm going to ask the question again, were we going to get any product - a non-software related productivity out of the R&D budget that we seem to have not enjoyed from the boosts that happened in '17 and '18."

But that's why the R&D will continue to be within that 10% to 15% of revenue range, and probably getting closer to or maintaining at that 15% as we just evaluate our entire suite of products, and ensure that they're positioned for the trends of growth that we are aligned to."
