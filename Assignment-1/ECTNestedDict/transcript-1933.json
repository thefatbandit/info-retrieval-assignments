         "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Goldfield Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.",
         "I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristine Walczak of Effective Corporate Communications. Thank you. You may begin."

      "Stephen Wherry": [
         "Thank you, Kristine, and good morning. We appreciate you joining us and for your continued interest in The Goldfield Corporation. Our CEO, John Sottile, sends his apologies for not being on our call today. As previously disclosed, Mr. Sottile is currently hospitalized and being treated for a non-COVID related respiratory condition. We will not be commenting further on Mr. Sottile's condition at this time. With me today is Jason Spivey, who serves as Acting Co-CEO and President of our wholly owned subsidiary, Power Corporation of America. Jason has more than 30 years' experience in the electrical construction industry.",
         "Demand for our services during the second quarter remained strong amid the extraordinary health and economic environment in which we are operating. Several key metrics we achieved include: successful service line expansion, which is beginning to pay dividends by opening doors to new customers and providing additional projects with existing customers, and contributed to a 19% increase in electrical construction revenue quarter-over-quarter.",
         "Improved volume of projects at higher margins, which grew electrical construction margin 420 basis points year-over-year and 340 basis points over the first quarter. Increased MSA project activity driven by our near record backlog, which should continue to provide strong opportunities during the second half of 2020. Most important, I want to sincerely thank all of our Goldfield employees for their commitment and resilience during these challenging times.",
         "Our existing pandemic plan, including measures implemented to protect employees in the field, and our work from home policies where appropriate, have been effective. Additionally, we continue to work in cooperation with our customers to meet their requirements for the safety of their employees and the general public. To date, we have not experienced any material adverse impacts on the availability of our workforce or key personnel as a result of COVID-19. The ability of our crews to continue to operate safely through the past several months in this difficult environment is one of our core competencies.",
         "I will now move to a review of our financials, of which I will review our second quarter results as compared to the prior year. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $47.8 million, an increase of $3.4 million, or 7.7%, compared to the same period last year. The increase in total revenue was attributable to improved electrical construction operations project activity, offset by lower real estate development activity.",
         "Electrical construction revenue in the 2020 second quarter was $46.7 million, an increase of $7.5 million, or 19%, from $39.2 million for the same period in 2019. This improvement was primarily due to a $5.8 million increase in MSA projects awarded and work completed in the Southeast region and a $5 million increase in MSA transmission projects volume and service line expansion in the Texas Southwest region. These increases were partially offset by a $3.7 million decrease in MSA customer project activity in the Mid-Atlantic region.",
         "Revenue from real estate development operations decreased to $1.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 from $5.2 million in the same period in 2019, primarily due to the number of units sold and the timing of completion of units available for sale.",
         "Gross margin on electrical construction operations increased 420 basis points to 18.7% compared to 14.5% for the same period in 2019. This improvement was mainly due to the increase in transmission project activity at a higher margin in the Texas Southwest region, which provided improved absorption of fixed costs.",
         "Comparing the year-over-year second quarter results, depreciation and amortization expenses increased approximately $263,000, or 9.6%, to $3 million. This increase was mainly due to higher capital expenditures to support revenue growth in electrical construction operations.",
         "Selling, general and administrative expenses remained level at $2.3 million.",
         "Operating income was $3.8 million in the 2020 second quarter compared to $1.6 million in the same 2019 period. This increase was mainly due to higher electrical construction gross profit, partially offset by lower real estate development gross profit and higher depreciation expenses. In the second quarter of 2020, our provision for income taxes was $1.1 million compared to $482,400 in the same period last year.",
         "Our current effective tax rate for the second quarter was 31.6% compared to 37.1%. The second quarter effective tax rate in 2019 was higher due to permanent differences in relation to expected income.",
         "Net income increased to $2.5 million, or $0.10 per share, for the 2020 second quarter from $819,000, or $0.03 per share, in the same period of 2019, primarily due to the increase in electrical construction activity, partially offset by lower real estate development activity.",
         "Cash provided by our operating activities in the period ended June 30, 2020, totaled $3 million compared to cash provided by operations of $11.5 million in 2019. The decrease in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to the timing of electrical construction projects.",
         "EBITDA for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, improved 54.2% to $6.9 million, compared to $4.5 million for the same period of 2019. This increase was primarily due to improved electrical construction gross profit, partially offset by the decline in real estate development operations gross profit.",
         "Total backlog at June 30, 2020, increased 109.2% to $417.3 million, compared to $199.5 million a year ago. This improvement is primarily attributable to the award of 4 new MSAs. At the end of the second quarter of 2020, our 12-month total electrical construction backlog increased 60.5% to $171.2 million compared to $106.7 million 1 year ago, mainly due to the increase in firm MSA project activity, as well as an increase in the amount of estimated MSA work attributable to the award of new MSAs.",
         "At June 30, 2020, we had approximately $27.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $42.5 million of funded debt and a $23 million revolving line of credit of which $12.3 million was available for borrowing.",
         "Total capital expenditures for the 6 months ended June 30, 2020 was $9 million compared to $14.3 million in the same period a year ago. This decrease was due to the mix of assets purchased versus leased in the comparable quarters for our electrical construction operations. Our CapEx projection for the full year 2020 is $15.7 million.",
         "This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

            "Yeah. Good morning Stephen and Jason. And John, get better soon. We're looking forward to you getting better. Stephen, the profit margins improved significantly, and John had spoken of this improvement in the previous conference call. The one thing I notice, the backlog had gone down from $473 million to $417 million on the long term. I assume we're bidding on jobs to get the backlog up? And are the jobs that we're bidding, are they significant in dollar amounts as we - of course we increased $0.25 billion the last time."

      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes sir. Sam, some of that large increase was due to a recent award of 4 new MSAs. As you know, as we - we burn through the backlog as we report our revenue. There can also be an adjustment as each quarter as we evaluate backlog, we have to make projections and estimates. And that's based on discussions with customers, based on discussions internally and looking at our workflow and the experience with that customer, is what I was trying to say. So that's the biggest reason there. But it helps the larger increases jump with the addition of new MSAs. We're continuing to bid and add work."

But I just was curious, I mean, is there a sort of pipeline of new business better than at the end of the year? Or I'm just trying to sort of reconcile that backlog number being down versus the end of the year."

We continue to gain momentum through our expanded service lines, and that's been very helpful. We expanded our service lines in Texas. And actually, we expanded in the substation and distribution areas, as I'm sure you're aware, which led us to additional transmission work with one of our significant customers. So I hope that answers your question."
