         "Thanks Keith. For the second quarter of 2020 effective new leases were down 2.1% and effective renewals were up 2.3% for a blended growth rate of 0.3%. Our July effective lease results indicate a 2% decline for new leases and a 0.2% growth for renewal for a blended decrease of 0.9%. Occupancy averaged 95.2% during the second quarter of 2020 compared to 96.1% in the second quarter of 2019. Today our occupancy has improved to 95.5%.",
         "We continue to have great success in conducting alternative method property tours for perspective residents and retaining many of our existing residents with only a slight deceleration in total leasing activity year-over-year. In the second quarter, we averaged 3,855 signed leases monthly in our same property portfolio as compared to the second quarter of 2019 when we averaged 4,016 signed leases. July 2020 total signed leasing activity is in line with July 2019.",
         "For the second quarter of 2020, we collected 97.7% of our scheduled rents with 1.1% of our rents in the current deferred rent arrangement and 1.2% delinquent. This compares to the second quarter of 2019 when we collected 98.6% of our scheduled rent but with a slightly higher 1.4% delinquency. The third quarter is off to a strong start with 98.7% of our July 2020 scheduled rents collected ahead of our collections of 98.4% in July of 2019.",
         "Last night we reported funds from operations for the second quarter of 2020 of $110.4 million or $1.09 per share representing a $0.26 per share sequential decrease in FFO from the first quarter of 2020. As outlined in last night\u2019s release included in this $0.26 sequential quarterly decrease is $14.02 of direct COVID related charges incurred during the quarter. After excluding the impact of this aggregate $14.02 per share sequential FFO decreased $0.12 in the second quarter resulting primarily from approximately $0.05 per share in lower same store net operating income resulting from a $0.02 per share decrease in revenue from our 90 basis points sequential occupancy decline, a $2.50 per share decrease in re venue resulting from an increase in bad debt reserves from approximately 45 basis points in the first quarter to approximately 180 basis points in the second quarter and an approximate $0.50 per share sequential increase in expenses. Approximately $2.50 in lower non same store development and retail NOI also resulting from a combination of lower occupancy and high bad debt reserves and approximately $0.04 per share in higher interest expense resulting from our April 20th, $750 million bond issuance.",
         "Turning to bad debt, in accordance with GAAP certain uncollected rent is recognized by us as income in the current month. We then evaluate this uncollected rent and establish what we believe to be an appropriate bad debt reserve which serves as a corresponding offset to property revenues in the same period. As previously mentioned, for same store our bad debt as a percentage of rental income increased from approximately 45 basis points in the first quarter to approximately 180 basis points in the second quarter.",
         "During the second quarter, we reserved effectively all of the 1.2% of delinquent rents as bad debt. Also in the second quarter, we reserved effectively half of 1.1% of deferred rent arrangements as bad debt. When a resident moves out owing us money, we have already reserved 100% of the amounts owed as bad debt and there will be no future impact to the income statement. We reevaluate our bad debt reserves monthly for collectability.",
         "In the second quarter for retail which is not part of same store. We reserved 100% of all amounts uncollected and not deferred which totaled approximately $800,000. Last night based upon our recent trends, we issued FFO and same store guidance for the third quarter. However, given the continued uncertainty surrounding the social and economic impacts from COVID-19 at this time we will not provide an update to our financial outlook for the full year.",
         "For the third quarter of 2020, as compared to the third quarter of 2019 at the midpoint. We expect same store revenues to decline by 1.6% driven primarily by lower occupancy, higher bad debt and lower miscellaneous fee income. We expect expenses to increase by 4.5% driven primarily by higher property insurance, higher property tax assessments and large property tax refunds receive in Atlanta and Houston in the third quarter of 2019.",
         "As a result, we expect NOI at the midpoint to decline by 5%. We expect FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of $1.14 to $1.20. The midpoint of $1.17 is $0.08 per share better than the $1.09 we reported in the second quarter. However, after adjusting our second quarter results for the previously discussed $0.14 of COVID related charges. Our $1.17 midpoint for the third quarter is a $0.06 per share sequential decrease resulting primarily from a $4.50 per share sequential decline in same store NOI as a result of $0.50 per share decrease in revenue resulting primarily from lower net market rents and a $0.04 per share increase in sequential expenses resulting primarily from the typical seasonality of our operating expenses, the timing of certain R&M cost and the timing of certain property tax refunds and assessment. And approximate $0.50 per share decline in non same store NOI resulting primarily from the same reasons and an approximately $0.50 per share increase in sequential interest expense resulting from our April 20 bond issuance.",
         "As of today, we have approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity comprised of just over $500 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amount outstanding on our $900 million unsecured credit facility. At quarter end, we had $185 million left to spend over the next 2.5 years under our existing development pipeline and we have no scheduled debt maturities until 2022. Our current excess cash is invested with various bank earning approximately 30 basis points.",
         "And finally, a quick update on technology. As I discussed our on-site teams are having great success with virtual leasing and we just completed our second virtual quarterly close, a task that would been so much harder if not nearly impossible without our investment in a cloud based financial systems. As mentioned yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, we\u2019re continuing our pilot of Chirp our smart access solution with great success and we\u2019re finding even more ways to utilize as the Chirp technology.",
         "At our pilot communities for self-guided tours, our leasing teams can use the Chirp access applications to grant a prospect limited access to tour both the community and specific available apartment homes in a completely touch less exchange. There is no need for the prospect to pick up physical keys or fobs or ever even enter the leasing office. Our leasing teams create the prospect a Chirp account, grant them access to the best apartments. Chose and [indiscernible] their unique wants and needs and then determine when the prospects access will expire.",
         "Additionally, we can utilize Chirp to quickly and automatically control the number of residents who have access to an amenity space such as a fitness center at any given time. Amenity spaces deemed as reservation only. Will require residents to use the Chirp access application to reserve a specific timeslot. Only those residents with confirmed reservations will have access to open the door of the amenity space for the allotted time. When the reservation expires, so does access to the amenity. Clearly, in this COVID environment our Chirp initiative takes on even more importance.",
         "At this time, we\u2019ll open up the call up to questions."

         "Thanks Rick. Strange days indeed. My prepared remarks today will be brief as we want to allow as much time as possible for Q&A. we want to make sure that we\u2019re providing you with the information that you find most useful to your ability to understand the current state of affairs in Camden\u2019s market.",
         "At the outfit of the COVID storm, we held an all Camden conference call during which we told our Camden team that our highest priorities were number one, taking care of our Camden family and two, taking care of our residents. During the second quarter, we made good on that promise. We undertook various initiatives including a frontline bonus paid to our 1,400 onsite team members and we provided grants to almost 400 associates from our long-established Camden Employee Emergency Relief Fund.",
         "We also established Camden resident relief fund from which we were able to provide grants to 8,200 residents at a time of maximum financial uncertainty in their lives. We were pleased to be able to provide this level of assistance to the people who were financially impacted during the early stages of the COVID crisis. On our first quarter conference call, we were asked when we thought we could reintroduce guidance and we said that when we felt like we had reasonable visibility into the next quarter we would do so.",
         "At that time based on the confidence level that we had from our operations and finance teams regarding our projected May and June results. On a scale of one to 10, it was probably a two, not good. As we sit here today, while our confidence level is less than it would be in normal times. We do feel it is sufficiently to provide guidance for the third quarter and we\u2019ve done so. I want to acknowledge the amazing job the team Camden has done in continuing to provide living expenses to our residents despite the radical changes we\u2019ve made to our policies, procedures and protocols. It\u2019s been incredible to the whole [ph]. Keep up the great work. And with a little good fortune, for which we were long overdue, we\u2019ll see you soon.",

         "Thanks, Kim. The theme for our on-hold music today was strange days. It\u2019s one of the most common ways I\u2019ve heard people life during this pandemic, strange days indeed. It\u2019s common for some to refer to current state of affairs are unprecedented. I\u2019ve concluded that while almost all agreed that these are strange days whether or not people believe these days are unprecedented is definitely age related. Younger people are more likely to view our current situation as unprecedented. People of my age are older and a far less likely to see these current strange days as unprecedented.",
         "In 1967, when I was 13 years old and a rock bank named The Doors released the song titled Strange Days. Clearly, I\u2019ve a background from that. This is the first verse of the song. Strange days have found us. Strange days have tracked us down. They\u2019re going to destroy, our casual joys. We shall go on playing or find a new town. The Doors were way ahead of their time both musically and culturally and indeed the next few years after 1967 will bring an extended period of strange days and civil unrest that were orders magnitude stranger than we\u2019ve seen thus far during a COVID storm.",
         "I\u2019m naturally optimistic and I promise you, this too shall pass since we\u2019re all in this together. We\u2019ll continue to encourage our Camden team to stay true to Camden\u2019s Why. Our purpose for being, that is to improve the lives of our team members, residents and shareholders. One experience at a time. Apartment demand is strong in a market than we\u2019ve expected given the nearly 40 million Americans that have filed for unemployment benefits with an official unemployment rate of 11.1%.",
         "Camden\u2019s geographic and product diversification has continued to lower the volatility of our rents and occupancy. Camden\u2019s Sunbelt market have fewer job losses than close to markets in the US overall. Our product mix that offers varying price points in urban and suburban locations continues to work for us. Camden was prepared to the pandemic, we have a great culture and flexible workplace and amazing employees that have adapted very, very well to the current work environment.",
         "Our investments in technology moving to the cloud based operating systems and our Chirp access systems have allowed us to not miss a beat when it comes to leasing or operating our portfolio or making payroll and some basic things like that. We have the best balance sheet in the sector and one of the best in replanned overall. We were prepared and continue to be prepared to do as well as we can in this environment. I think we\u2019ll do well long-term. I want to give a shout out to our amazing Camden\u2019s teammates for all that they do for our residents and taking care of each other every single day.",

Alex, I think you talked about lower occupancy, higher bad debt. I guess can you talk a little bit more specifically on Houston and maybe even Phoenix. We were surprised to see the 2% occupancy drop in Phoenix. Thank you."

            "Jeff, Houston continues to be one of our weaker markets. We have two challenges headwinds and separate from the COVID in Houston. The energy business is obviously still continuing to be under pressure. But also, we were scheduled and continue to be scheduled to deliver roughly 19,000 apartments in 2020 according to Vitans [ph] numbers so those are in the process of being brought online.",
            "The place where we see the most impact to that is in Downtown, Midtown area where a lot of the new deliveries are coming online. So that would have been an issue irrespective of trying to absorb 20,000 apartment, 19,000 apartments in an environment where the job growth was already going to be a little bit under pressure from the energy business and yet on top of that, the job losses that are not related to the energy business at all.",
            "Yes, I mean it\u2019s more of a challenging environment. We think that in terms of renewal leases or renewals that are going out in Houston, one out in July those are going out at basically flat. It\u2019s one of the - so our renewal overall across our markets for the July renewals that went out is about 1.8% across the platform. It\u2019s as high as 4% renewals in Austin and then at the low end of that would be Houston at basically flat. So it certainly feels like from a renewal standpoint more getting back closer to regular order in terms of every market that we are operating in, we\u2019re sending out renewals with increases.",
            "Specifically in Phoenix, at the seasonal weakness that we always have in the middle of the summer. The 2% occupancy drop is a little bit more than what we would normally see but it\u2019s not unusual to have that kind of weakness. We still have pretty decent rental growth in Phoenix and it continues to be on a projection going forward. It continues to be one of our bright spot markets for us. It\u2019s been incredibly strong for the last two years and we think that market is going to continue perform well for us."

Obviously with low interest rate and the marginal folks that were going to go buy houses, are buying houses right now. But generally speaking when you look at our demographic profile with a lot of single folks that are living in our apartments even with low interest rate. They\u2019re just not buying houses and so with that said we haven\u2019t really seen any increase in moving out to rent houses or buy houses."

            "First question is just on your new leasing renewal pricing. It did actually get a little bit better, it looks like in July versus the second quarter. And I just want to be clear here on the renewals because it sounds like some of the renewals that you\u2019re doing now are also improving versus the second quarter so, just trying to understand how we should think about rental pricing dynamics in the third quarter and the rest of the year. I mean, are things getting better or worse you think?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Well on the renewal side, there\u2019s no question they\u2019re getting better. Part of that though if you\u2019ll recall for the first 90 days after the COVID storm hit, we went to shut down mode. We actually from a policy perspective just so we\u2019re not going to take any renewal increases for the next 60 to 90 days and then as it turned out it was a little right at 90 days that we just did not process. We offered everybody renewal at flat.",
            "Now, could we have as it turns out in 2020 in hindsight, could you\u2019ve gotten 1% or 2% increases? Probably. But from the standpoint of two thoughts on that. One was we just had no idea how to measure the collapsing demand from 30 or 40 million evaporating. So there was a great concern on our part that you need to keep every resident that you have in place, that it\u2019s possible. So that was one part of it. The second part was really more of a - it was just more. In terms of resident who have been kind of shut in to their apartments most of them working from home. And at the time, we had been mandated in almost every case to close all amenity spaces.",
            "So you have people who are in the midst of pandemic, 40 million job losses and then they can\u2019t even use the amenities. It just seemed like a terrible idea to be pushing through rental increases to our residents at a time where they couldn\u2019t even full value of the proposition that they\u2019ve felt they bargained for, so part of it was just to protect the relationship that we have with our residents and not create that kind of tension that would come from leasing consultants trying to get what would amount to $20 or $30 rental increase from residents in that timeframe.",
            "So the net of all that is, our renewals were probably under what could have been achieved in the first half of the year and obviously it\u2019s back to regular order now and we\u2019re just in a really different place. We\u2019re in different place. Our residents are in a different place. For the most part our amenity spaces are all open, some with restrictions. But they\u2019re open again. So we expect much better results on renewals. But new leases in July were just tiny bit better than a tick up from where we in the first half of the year.",
            "I think more importantly for us. Is that we were able to maintain and above 95% occupancy rate with between the new lease activity and the renewals. So to me that was more important to see the stability there and it gives us something to grow on, going forward."

            "Let me just add that. Early on in the pandemic, we along with the leadership of the NMHC Group, Doug Bibby and his team. We hosted an industry conference call and then we came up with as a team the best practices for the way the industry ought to face the pandemic and the industry was all about, even before late fees were banned by governments or evictions and things like that. We came out with a set of principles that were just bind to help residents in a very uncertain time.",
            "And one of the principles was, flat renewals, no late fees, work with people in terms of payment plans and things like that. I think the industry did a great job of showing it that they really care about their customers and so to Keith\u2019s point. Sure we could have renewed leases during the first part of the pandemic at decent rates. But we just chose not to now. There are some folks in our industry that just didn\u2019t do that and they did raise rents and you know that\u2019s just not our culture.",
            "And I think most of the industry followed those principles of trying to help their customers in a very, very uncertain and complicated time. The thing it\u2019s really interesting about this is that, we\u2019re four months into it right, which is like nothing compared to the financial crisis and all that. And so, so uncertain and I think that people -- when you think about how you treat your customers. It\u2019s all about building your brand long-term and making sure that customers understand that you actually care about them."

Just second question would be, if you have any stats you can provide on the nature of your total portfolio in terms of which buildings you think are high rise product versus not. I mean, I think you definitely have some in Hollywood, Washington DC. I think you have at least one in Houston. And whether you\u2019re seeing as well any difference in leasing demand for what would be more high-rise concrete steel type product versus lower rise stick and brick product? Thanks."

            "For us the good news. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good news or bad news. So we don\u2019t have as many high rises as we have mid and low rises. We balanced the portfolio pretty well to - like just take Houston as an example. We have two high rises in Houston that are actually high rises, 22 storey, 30 storey. We\u2019ve seen really no change in demand for high rises and some in those markets and same at DC. Because DC is actually a stand-up market for us right now, which is great? But when you think about our portfolio in Houston. We then go to a midrise where you might have a H3 building and then six H3 building and then we go to down as low as two or three storey lots. Actually we have some older property we built, older properties we built and then 20 years ago, that are two storey.",
            "So we tend to be more suburban, more lower density but we really haven\u2019t seen a lot of differentiation between high rise or low rise given though we don\u2019t have many high rises. And then I think the other part of that equation is sort of geographic mix and product mix that we have and generally speaking we\u2019re sort of skewed towards suburban and more B than A. right now, we don\u2019t really see a lot of variation in collections or in demand for any of that product. It\u2019s all about the same."

I was curious, how much of an impact that had on your same store revenue growth in the second quarter and then what did you assume for bad debt in 3Q same store revenue guidance because from the July collections data. It looks like they were actually better than both the first quarter and 2Q of last year?"

            "Yes, absolutely so. As I said our bad debt went from approximately 45 basis points in the first quarter to approximately 180 basis points in the second quarter. So you can look at that, 140 basis points and that\u2019s a direct reduction in revenue on a sequential same store basis. So you can do the math on that. When we look at what we\u2019ve got in our model on a go forward basis. We\u2019re anticipating that the third quarter bad debt drops down to somewhere right around 125 basis points so it goes from 180 to 125 and so hopefully we\u2019ll get some pickup on that. Now that pickup is going to be offset by slightly lower net market rents and will also be offset by slightly lower re-letting income. We did get a fair amount of re-letting income in the second quarter as we did have folks break their leases."

            "Yes, absolutely. So you have to think about Chirp and two components. The first one is the gateway and that\u2019s the Chirp that controls the access gateways also controls the amenities space etc. we\u2019ve rolled out right around 12,000 units and we expect to have gateway rolled out across our entire portfolio really by the end of the year. The second component is, what we call the [indiscernible] curb-to-couch solution which includes gateway but also goes to the individual locks of the unit and we\u2019ve rolled out about 1,500 doors with that solution and we expect that probably by about this point next year, we will have total sales. So it\u2019s gateway plus lock rolled out across our entire portfolio.",
            "It\u2019s really interesting when we originally looked at what the value proposition was for this, we looked at a lot of things around not having to re-key locks, time that are on folks, people spent, letting vendors etc. in. and then we also knew that there was some embedded value proposition to a resident to be able to push a button and let the pizza delivery guy in the gate and go straight to their front door rather than having to get out of their jammies and walk down to the front gate and open it up.",
            "We never would have thought of COVID-19 and all of the additional benefits that we\u2019ve not gotten from this. And so we\u2019re still at the point of trying to quantifying all of the benefits. But I will tell you when we look at orders that we see that say, gyms must be a 25% capacity or 50% capacity. This is nearly impossible for a typical apartment operator to enforce. However with our Chirp access application, we can do that and we can do it very easily.",
            "When we think about virtual leasing which is undoubtedly the future of our industry. You can\u2019t have virtual leasing unless you have an access application that opens gate, close doors. So there are a lot of additional benefits that we\u2019re still in the process of quantifying. But ultimately, we think this is a huge differentiator for Camden and ultimately, we\u2019ll be huge differentiator for the industry."

Are in there not paying rent and off those that aren\u2019t paying rent, how many do you think will not pay rent versus are just saving the money and once the eviction moratoriums go over, they\u2019ll pay you the back rent?

Our Houston numbers are not even single digits. They\u2019re in the point 3% or 4% range and California is 3% change. It shows you sort of mentality and that gets to the whole sort of Government Issue. I mean if you\u2019re a resident in California and you listen to the Mayor of LA, the Governor. Their messaging is, don\u2019t worry you don\u2019t have to pay and the limitation of late fees. The limitation of being able to evict somebody creates, what we call ghosting. Which is they just don\u2019t show up and they don\u2019t have the ability. They know they don\u2019t have any negative recourse, you\u2019re not charging them interest or late fees and they know they can\u2019t be evicted and so you just have, you have this ghosting scenario that happens out there and it is a - I think a serious morale hazard issue and it\u2019s just - in most of our Sun Belt markets people just think, they should pay their rent on time, if they have the money and California, it\u2019s just a little different animal."

A lot of the people that aren\u2019t paying today actually have the ability to pay. They\u2019re just not paying. So we have clearly modified our bad debt policy and increase the accrual for bad debts. But we might be surprised that people actually do pay when the government tells them they should pay. I think one of the things that it is really interesting and this is I think sort of system wide but it\u2019s probably more important in California is that, the Apartment Associations are trying to educate people because when the Governors and Mayors say that there\u2019ll be no evictions. A lot of folks think that means, that get free. Right. And like okay, we\u2019re not going to evict or foreclose on anybody and they think that during that period it\u2019s free.",

So basically, you\u2019re flat from the second quarter and the impact in the third quarter is really from just continued bad debt and some lower fees. So I guess, why do you guys think that your markets, your portfolio is holding up better than the coastal urban guys who are continuing to unfortunately experience accelerating weakness. I mean you guys have had increased COVID recently. But that doesn\u2019t seem to fade a factor. So what do you think is it, is it just less social unrest, less of the protest or what is going on your market for you guys seem to stabilize where in the coastal areas it seems to be accelerating?"

I mean they\u2019re significantly higher in the coast and the Sun Belt markets have not lost as many jobs and when you look at social unrest there\u2019s an issue too. There are some markets where you can\u2019t even get to your property because of the urban nature and the sort of takeover block in certain cities. So I think it\u2019s all about the things that been driving our markets before when you think about recoveries, the Sun Belt recovers quicker and has more jobs generally.

The impetus for that was I\u2019ve laid out some of the rationale earlier in my comments. But in addition to that, it was just the timeliness of it. It was such a jolt to so many people in the way it happened unlike in previous downturn. Where there was sort of this rolling layoff scenario, people had time to adjust and make preparations. This is was you think you were good on a Friday and on Monday, your job is gone and so people were, there was an urgency to getting some financial relief to both residents and our Camden employees who got affected.",
            "The impact to that was really always to bridge a gap in time to get to a scenario where there was a more permanent relief available to both residents and to Camden employees and that\u2019s happened. And it happened through the stimulus, it happened through the plus up on employment benefits. Now there\u2019s - there\u2019s lot of wrangling now about - are they going to extend that into what extent. But even in the scenarios where they talk about not including the plus up, the provision the most conservative provision that I\u2019ve seen is 70% of your previous income in unemployment payments and honestly for most Camden residents where we have an average household income of about $105,000 our average rental payment is about 18% of that. So if you\u2019re paying 18% of your rent, you\u2019re getting 70% in unemployment. Most people can figure out a way to make that work. So now that\u2019s the long answer to saying, we don\u2019t anticipate it."

We actually have collected have collections higher in the month of July at this point in the month than we had in 2019 which is fairly remarkable and my guess is, is that there is some component of that people have - some associated goodwill.

It\u2019s cheap to go to California and to Seattle that\u2019s very expensive to move out of it.

If you look at - if you take immigration out of the equation there\u2019s been out migration in California and New York and for the last 10 years and the only thing that is increasing - gets to be positive, is immigration. So I think that\u2019s going to continue.",

After 9/11 Downtown New York was like people talked about how it will never come back, right. Well, it did. I think that Americans have short memories and when it comes down. How do I feel about where I am? I think the fundamental challenges and highly regulated very experience markets where people are paying 40% to 50% of their income for rent or housing, that just is unsustainable and that\u2019s why I think a lot of them out migration has happened for a long time and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change. And will people put up with it and deal with it in the future, yes. I don\u2019t think big cities are going to empty out. But I just think it\u2019s just the pressure on people to want to have a decent place to live without having to pay after income. It is going to continue to drive out migration into these more affordable markets and I think that\u2019s going to continue."

I assure you can do go $500 million worth of mezz and move the needle a little. But at the end of the day what moves our business long-term is our cash flow that we grow from our properties and so we want to have the cleanest balance sheet in a simplest structure and not have any distractions having to deal with small equity positions or mezz positions and then have to go deal with people in that, that\u2019s just in our forte.",

So we got that tradecraft down to an art and so, prior to the kind of most recent spiking in cases in Texas and particular but also in Florida. We had gone back to sort of hybrid model where we would allow access to our leasing offices for someone that wanted to do an in-person tour as long as they have both our folks and the prospect worse mask and socially distance. So we did that and then with the spiking, the feedback we got from our folks is they just were not as comfortable with that approach. So we went back to basically an appointment only virtual tour.",

The prospect interestingly enough, when we ask our prospects what their preference is about 30% to 40% of our prospects tell us that they would prefer this permanently as a way to lease apartments.

So if you\u2019re underwriting a project in Houston or anywhere today there is no discount and you have to take a lower cap rate and then I think the belief that is that, is that the cash flow will grow faster than before the pandemic and you\u2019ll get back to a total return that is rationale total return with that increase in cash flow.",

You\u2019re going to look at their equity returns with incredibly low cost of debt. I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of activity and interest in multi-family. The question will be how long does it take to get those investors to a point where they can feel like they can do some underwriting in the next couple of years.",
            "The development side is a little more complicated because constructions loans are really hard to get today. Lenders have lots of others issues in real estate, be it retail and office [ph] and others. And so increase in exposure for them in a construction side and multi-family is hard for them to do today and I think that\u2019s where the opportunity might be from an acquisition perspective, but we\u2019ll just have to see."

How much did that supply view in terms of the number of people, was it lesser or more than you thought? And the reason why I ask is, do you think there\u2019s a longer-term impact in your underwriting criteria in terms of looking at the individual credits of your tenants before signing a lease?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, so in terms of the impact in our California portfolio so if you break it out between, where we\u2019re total collections and LA, Orange County which is our lowest collection for the second quarter of 2020, we have collected 92.6% of our scheduled rents and that\u2019s the lowest in our portfolio and it\u2019s really not even close beyond that. Everything else in our portfolio, Southeast Florida is 94% and then everything else is above 95% and most are in the 98% range. So it\u2019s clearly an outlier. But if you take the 92.6% collected and you break it out between deferred payment plan and truly delinquent, 2.3% is deferred payment and 5.1% is delinquent. So the 2.3%, we have had conversations with the people have said we have financial distress, we need a path forward and that means we have a written agreement with them on how they\u2019re going to get whole on the rent from a standpoint of their delinquency.",
            "So the 5.1%, so if we don\u2019t for the most part they don\u2019t communicate. Maybe they can\u2019t pay and just choose not to communicate. But our guess is that, they\u2019re a pretty large percentage of those folks, have just gone dark because they think they cannot pay their rent for some period of time and get away with it. And so the challenge is, that the policy prescriptions of no evictions, no late fees and by the way sort of wink and a nod among political leaders that we can\u2019t give you direct rent relief. But we\u2019re creating conditions on the ground that prevent you from being evicted from your apartment and in some way, that\u2019s rent relief which it\u2019s truly not from a liability standpoint. But from the standpoint of do I have to pay, it does create that.",
            "So I think this is a unique circumstance relative to this pandemic and it\u2019s hard for me to imagine. Even in the great financial crisis. We didn\u2019t have policy prescriptions of that variety anywhere including in California. Now may the politics have changed that much in the last 10 years? But I think it\u2019s probably ultimately, ends up being pretty unique to this particular pandemic and not some greater incidence of policy prescriptions around, you can\u2019t evict people who don\u2019t pay their rent, that\u2019s my personal view."

Like I said earlier, we have - people have short-term memories and at the end of the day. Once the pandemic is over. Everybody gets back to work and they\u2019re focusing on their lives. They\u2019re going to do what they want to do and I think people do love urban environments. They love restaurants. They love going to the ballpark and when that comes back. They will engage that again.",
            "I do think that there will be some. But I do think that continue out migration from coastal markets to Sun Belt markets is going to continue. But I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s not going to - those markets are still going to be fine markets long-term. They\u2019re just going to have issues that they have today pre-pandemic. So from our perspective when we start thinking about where we want to be, it continues to be the same drivers longer term which is high job growth, low pro-business governments, good weather, young people, great workforce, that kind of stuff.",
            "I think from a sort of product mix perspective. We definitely are going to continue to invest in urban and suburban properties. I think that from a development perspective. We are thinking really hard about our spaces and how we utilize the space inside the common areas and are thinking a lot about okay, maybe the work from home is going to be a bigger piece of the equation because I do think that, that the work from home is going to be massively more than it was pre-pandemic and primarily because if you think about Camden. We have 450 people plus or minus working from home and they\u2019re doing really well.",
            "And so the people that had hour commutes one way are going wow, I got two hours of my life back, plus I don\u2019t have wear and tear my car and all those expenses. So we can get people their time back and raises in essence by letting them work from home. So from our perspective we\u2019re going to spend a lot more time looking at our properties and creating a more user-friendly work from home environment.",
            "Prior to once the pandemic hit, one of the things we did is amp up the bandwidth in all of our properties because if you had low bandwidth. I mean we were just getting people going nuts because they couldn\u2019t do Zoom calls and things like that. So we amped our bandwidth up and I think we\u2019re going to - so when we think about modifying our existing buildings and then building new buildings, you have to think about that work from home component. I think that\u2019s going to be a big shift."

It\u2019s always going to have challenges that just like New York City has challenges but people love to live in New York City and I think they love California. California will continue to struggle with its issues. But I think that long-term California is a good market and I don\u2019t think when we start talking about our portfolio and when you think about our Sun Belt mix.",
            "California right now is dragging our performance down and have we not had California then we would definitely have better same store numbers and better everything, better collections and all that. So but ultimately when you think, the way I think about portfolio is geographically, diverse and product mix, diverse portfolio and over a long period of time. The volatility balances out and we lower volatility prior to the pandemic. Southern California was one of our better markets. We were growing 3.5%, 4% and the average is good. It was offsetting our slower growth in Houston.",
            "To me, I know that there\u2019s a lot of people piling on to California, New York and Seattle and some of these other markets. They\u2019re not going away, there will be good, long-term markets and hopefully the pandemic moves through fast and we\u2019ll get back to good growth. They will continue to have the pressure from government trying to cap rents through rent control and other issues. But generally speaking, even if you put a rent control law and generally is better for the incumbents and harder to build means that you don\u2019t have competition so the offset to maybe the tough government and out migration is you\u2019re not going to rebuild those markets very often and they\u2019ll still be good."

So obviously we\u2019re getting some uptick. But effectively in our guidance we\u2019re assuming that occupancy is flat in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. When you look at expenses almost all of that was known. Really the largest driver that we typically have in expenses is the timing of property tax refunds and it\u2019s just the way the timing works that the third quarter was going to have higher sequential property tax number and in fact, if you looked at it on a third quarter, 2020 to third quarter, 2019 as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. You also had the same impact where we got some very favorable refunds in Atlanta and in Houston in the third quarter of 2019. So that\u2019s really the driver. The drivers are by in large property tax driven."

But within the context of how much Austin has grown over the years that\u2019s become less and less important.
