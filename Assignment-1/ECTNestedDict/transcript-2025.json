         "Thank you, Suren.",
         "Revenues for the second quarter of 2020 increased 244% to a record $6.6 million compared to revenue of $1.9 million in the same quarter last year. Sequentially, this represents an increase of 199% when compared to revenues of $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in revenue was primarily due to Personal Protective Equipment sales, such as N95 masks and sanitizer products. These products were sold by our Integra Pharma unit as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "Gross profit in the second quarter of 2020 increased 72% to $2 million, or 30.4% of revenues, compared to gross profit of $1.2 million or 60.7% of revenues in the same quarter last year. The increase in gross profit was at lower margins, which was primarily due to lower-margin sales of Personal Protective Equipment in our Integra Pharma unit.",
         "Operating expenses in the second quarter of 2020 were $2.5 million compared to $1 million in the same quarter last year. This increase is primarily due to non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, which included executive bonuses for 2019, IT expenditures and marketing expenses.",
         "Net loss in the second quarter of 2020 was $542,000, or a loss of $0.07 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $60,000 or $0.01 per basic and diluted share in the same quarter last year.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 525% to $500,000 compared to $80,000 in the same quarter last year.",
         "Looking at the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents were $4.2 million as of June 30, 2020, compared with $7.7 million as of March 31, 2020. A sizeable portion of this cash usage was due to inventory purchases surrounding Personal Protective Equipment sales to address the COVID-19 pandemic, a notable driver of our sales in the quarter. I should also note that Accounts Receivable and Inventory increased to $3.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, as of the end of the quarter, compared to only $0.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2020, which helped our total current assets only decline $0.3 million compared to March 31, 2020, even with the decrease in cash.",
         "As the pandemic subsides, we don\u2019t expect to carry this same level of inventory going forward, and we do not foresee a need for further capital to support the business."

         "Welcome to Trxade Group\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.",
         "During today\u2019s presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. This conference is being recorded today, July 27, 2020.",
         "The earnings press release accompanying this conference call was issued at the close of market today. The quarterly report, which includes the Company\u2019s results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, will be filed with the SEC tomorrow morning.",
         "On our call today is Trxade Group\u2019s Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Suren Ajjarapu; and Howard Doss, Chief Financial Officer.",
         "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that statements made on this call and webcast, including those regarding future financial results and industry prospects, are forward-looking and may be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the call. Please refer to the Company's SEC filings for a list of associated risks, and we would also refer you to the Company's website for more supporting industry information.",
         "At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Suren Ajjarapu, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Sir, the floor is yours."
      ],
      "Suren Ajjarapu": [
         "Thank you, Operator, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call, the first earnings call we have had as a public company.",
         "Before we walk through our financial and operational results for the quarter, for those of you new to the Company, I\u2019d like to walk you through who we are and how we are revolutionizing the way independent pharmacies procure drugs.",
         "Prior to the launch of our company, obtaining drug quotes as an independent pharmacy was an extremely laborious and time-inefficient process with no insight or transparency into a fair market price, or what others are paying for the same drug. Traditional wholesalers would provide unfavorable payment terms, slow delivery, and create a difficult conundrum for the approximately 22,000 independent pharmacies nationwide.",
         "We identified this market inefficiency as well as the incredible potential in these independent pharmacies, which together maintain $78 billion in annual purchasing power, and proceeded to launch Trxade.",
         "We designed, own and operate a business-to-business web-based marketplace platform, bringing together the nation\u2019s independent pharmacies with accredited national pharmaceutical suppliers to provide a uniquely efficient and transparent buying and selling process. Our platform lets these independents know that they are receiving a fair price from competing suppliers on fair payment terms and often with next-day delivery.",
         "We believe this radical price transparency, economy of scale and competition amongst suppliers leads up to a 10% reduction in a pharmacy\u2019s total annual drug purchase costs with drug-level savings of up to 90% on certain pharmaceutical products. Our platform saves pharmacists from having to manually compare prices across distributors, saving hundreds of hours of unnecessary labor annually, and eliminating negative reimbursement, in some cases filling the prescription at a loss.",
         "Our revenue model is simple, we charge a percentage of transaction fee based on the value of drug purchases transacted on our platform, similar to PayPal or Visa-like model.",
         "To date, we\u2019ve seen incredible success in garnering attention from independent pharmacies nationwide, validating our business model. We currently have over 11,700 pharmacies on our platform, representing over 50% market penetration into the 22,000 independent pharmacies nationwide.",
         "Our growth drivers for the Trxade platform are two-fold: one, increasing the average purchases per pharmacy so that pharmacies transact an increasingly high percentage of total drug purchases through our trading platform; and two, continuing to expand our market penetration, adding new and independent pharmacies to our network.",
         "Now, proceeding to our second quarter 2020 financial and operational results, I was particularly pleased with our growth in the second quarter compared to 2019, achieving record quarterly revenues, while continuing to grow average spend per pharmacy on our proprietary platform.",
         "Our affiliated services offering continues to expand, with our telemedicine subsidiary Bonum Health in particular shaping up to be a critical healthcare service to thousands of customers across the United States. We recently appointed Senior Healthcare Executive Ashton Maaraba as President of Bonum Health to spearhead our telemedicine efforts, in which we see a significant opportunity as more and more consumers shelter in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "Ashton is an intuitive leader with acute business acumen and expertise in channel and market development. I am confident in his ability to drive adoption of Bonum Health amongst both employers seeking to provide unique healthcare perks to their workers, as well as to individuals seeking a low-cost, convenient way to speak with a doctor.",
         "On the capital markets fronts, we\u2019ve made exciting progress over the last several months, fortifying our balance sheet, uplisting to NASDAQ, being added to the Russell MicroCap Index, and now, today, hosting our first earnings call. We continue to mature as a public company, and our progress this year is a testament to these efforts.",
         "Now, before we go further, I\u2019d like Howard Doss, the CFO, to walk through some key financial highlights from the second quarter of 2020.",
         "Thank you, Howard.",
         "Overall, I am pleased with our growth in the second quarter, laying the foundation for what we hope will be an incredible year. And what\u2019s driving this growth? Of course the platform growth along with Personal Protective Equipment sales. We continue to meet or exceed internal projections while regularly attaining key milestone achievements. As a founder of Trxade, I firmly believe that we are better positioned to create sustainable value for our shareholders than any prior time in our history.",
         "I look forward to continued operational execution into the second half of 2020 and beyond.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the Operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator, take it over."

            "Certainly. Suren, I wanted to\u2014before we get to the Integra piece, which is really impressive, I wanted to just ask you a couple of questions about the platform. The revenue was down a little bit sequentially. I was looking for a little bit of growth there considering you added more pharmacies. What were the drivers there in the quarter? How much did COVID impact pharma spend, and how was the same-store sales growth, or as you refer to as revenue per store, compared to the first quarter?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. I\u2019ll take a first stab at it and then I\u2019ll pass it on to Howard if he wants to add anything. Definitely, we saw the impact of the COVID because most of the stores have been shut down in the month of April and a little part of May, but eventually they had to open. Slowly and steadily everything is opening up, so I don\u2019t have the exact percentage of the decrease, how much they\u2019ve bought less, but definitely we saw the impact.",
            "And the percentage calculations, Howard, if you want to take that, please go ahead."

         "Remarks": [
            "Actually, I don\u2019t have those calculations right in front of me, but I do know that for the six months ending June revenue in Trxade Inc was about $2.9 million where the revenue over the six-month period in 2019 was about $2.1 million, so over the six months period of time I think we still had some pretty nice revenue."

         "Remarks": [
            "As far as\u2014they are buying from us because if you look at the brand drugs, Gene, and the percentage is always less. You have a (inaudible) acquisition cost plus or minus pricing there, most of the margins on the pharmacies get negative reimbursement on the generic products and that is what is our main focus, even though 75% of our product, that most through our platform is generic and remaining 25% is on the branded drug side.",
            "We continue to grow on the generic side: how can we add more and more product list than worrying about high dollar value product because you are on\u2014the pharmacy has a set margin plus or minus percentage versus on the generic side."

            "Okay, makes sense.",
            "Switching gears then to Integra, I mean you\u2019re really knocked it out of the park there with the PPE revenue. I\u2019m just wondering if Q2 we should view that as an extraordinarily high quarter due to the onset of the COVID pandemic just sort of peaking there. How sustainable are these PPE sales in the back half of the year?"

      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "You\u2019re absolutely correct, but nobody understands where this PPE opportunity is there. We definitely took the opportunity in the second quarter. How sustainable it is, nobody knows, but we continue to grow the platform and see any other opportunities on the PPE side to help our pharmacies because if you look at April, all the pharmacies were stacked up with sanitizers and no big wholesalers had the sanitizers by month of May. Everything changed, the dynamics, so you don\u2019t need it, and then they jumped onto the PPE equipment like masks and so on, gloves and isolations gowns.",
            "Now as the States are mandating more and more masks, we may see that spike in the requirement that gets to these independent pharmacies or other schools and stuff that come to us to buy us when the schools start opening up, but nobody really knows what the PPE opportunity is there, so we cannot quantify that, whether it\u2019s going to be the same as second quarter, but we see some improvement or see the really\u2014I don\u2019t know what is the percent of the growth will be on PPE."

            "Tell me, you mentioned\u2014well, I noticed that you signed some\u2014a law firm during the quarter, so who is the customer here? Is it the pharmacy? Is it the employer? Or are you targeting both?"

Whether it\u2019s a law firm or a pharmacy, but especially the testing side we executed to both the nursing, the point of care people that administer the test onsite, we became a supplier of those test kits, but CLIA, CLIA certified, FDA approved antibody testing is not allowed at these pharmacies still, so we could not move any of our products to these pharmacies, but we went after the employers or point of care facilities to move these testing kits."
