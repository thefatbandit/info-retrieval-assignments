         "Thanks, Julie, and Aloha to everyone. Thank you very much for joining us today, and we hope that you are safe and well and your families are as well. I am very proud of the performance of our company and our employees during this COVID-19 pandemic. While all of us face uncertainties regarding the trajectory of the virus and its implications for our pace of economic recovery, what is clear is the strength and resilience of our businesses, the dedication of our employees and our commitment to supporting our customers and our economy throughout this period.",
         "On last quarter\u2019s call, we talked about the strengths that would help our company navigate through COVID-19. Our long history of providing essential services for most of our state; our strong liquidity across our enterprise; the stabilizing effect of decoupling and other regulatory mechanisms at our utility; and our bank\u2019s conservative approach to risk, low-risk loan portfolio, low-cost core deposit base and strong capital position. This strong foundation, coupled with other factors that benefited earnings, enabled us to deliver solid financial results for the second quarter, $0.45 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the same period last year, while achieving important progress on our long-term goals.",
         "I\u2019ll start with an update on the virus and economic conditions in Hawaii before turning to an update on our companies. Then Greg will review our financial results and outlook. We\u2019re fortunate that Hawaii continues to have the nation\u2019s lowest COVID-19 mortality rate. While cases per capita in Hawaii have generally been lower than other states throughout the pandemic, we have seen an uptick in cases recently, which our state is working to address. We\u2019re seeing the effects of reopening of our local economy and unprecedented federal stimulus, which is estimated to have delivered approximately $7.7 billion in funding to our state thus far. Hawaii\u2019s unemployment rate improved to 13.9% in June after peaking at 23.8% in April. At our utility, while sales were 11.6% below the same quarter last year, we\u2019ve seen sales improve in some areas such as shopping centers and retail since opening of our local economy began.",
         "We\u2019ve also seen areas that have maintained stability throughout the COVID period such as our federal government and military presence. Residential real estate values have remained strong and are up from last year, showing continued strength for the collateral that secures much of our bank\u2019s lending. A key question for Hawaii\u2019s economy is when transpacific travel and tourism can resume. Hawaii currently plans to allow travelers with a negative COVID test to forego the mandatory 14-day quarantine beginning September 1.",
         "Recognizing Hawaii\u2019s prudent management of COVID-19, Japan announced Hawaii\u2019s addition to a list of 12 global destinations deemed safe for Japan residents to resume travel. This will help restart tourism, although it may take some time before we see tourism near pre-COVID levels. Of course, all of these plans are subject to the actual course of the virus and the effectiveness of mitigation. While tourism and federal stimulus developments will have a significant impact on the pace at which our economy rebounds, our state does have the ingredients for a solid recovery.",
         "We continue to benefit from a robust federal government presence here as host to the U.S.-Indo Pacific Command, from which the U.S. watches 52% of the world\u2019s surface and all component service commands. We also believe the unique environment and experience we offer here will continue to make our state a very attractive place for tourism. There is a new energy to economic diversification efforts here as well, and our companies are actively supporting those efforts.",
         "Turning to our company. At our utility, solid regulatory foundations have served both the company and our customers well and enabled us to be a source of strength for our community during this unprecedented time. Our decoupled regulatory structure has provided accrued revenue stability despite reduced sales in the second quarter. On June 30, our commission approved our request to defer COVID-related costs to be considered for potential recovery in a future proceeding. To help customers during this time, we extended our suspension of disconnections through September 1 and have offered a range of payment plans to help customers manage their bills.",
         "Working closely with customers is a key focus for us. Ensuring our services are affordable is also a key focus now even more than ever. Customer bills are lower now than last quarter due to lower fuel costs and a reduction in the RBA component of the bill due to higher-than-projected electricity sales in 2019. A customer using 500-kilowatt hours of electricity in July paid 14% less for that energy than in March. We are also working to become a highly efficient utility. And as of June 30, we recorded $7.2 million in a regulatory liability account related to ERP benefits, amounts that are to be returned to customers as a reduction in O&M expenses included in rates. We\u2019ve also secured significantly lower and fixed priced renewable energy plus storage contracts through our recent RFPs, which will help lower and stabilize customer bills once those come online.",
         "Last week, the PUC issued a final decision in the Hawaii Electric Light rate case. Results were consistent with the interim decision maintaining current effective rates. In recognition of financial challenges our customers face in this COVID period, in late May, we and the consumer advocate filed a settlement with the PUC to hold base rates flat in Hawaiian Electric\u2019s 2020 Oahu rate case. You may recall that the PUC had commissioned a management audit as part of the rate case.",
         "The audit report highlighted areas for improvement, including several we had identified and were working to address. In response to the audit and as part of the settlement, we committed to ramp up to $25 million in annual savings by year-end 2022 to be delivered to customers beginning by 2023. We have proposed to deliver those savings to customers through PBR. An interim decision on the settlement is scheduled for October. In addition, we are no longer planning to file a Maui Electric 2021 rate case.",
         "To offset the lack of a base rate increase and achieve our $25 million by year-end 2022 commitment, we\u2019re developing and have begun implementing plans to reduce costs, including through overtime reductions, better scheduling and coordination, managed reductions of our workforce and reducing lower priority work. And in the second quarter, we already began to see some of these savings. As we advance these important cost reductions, we, our commissions and other stakeholders continue to ensure that the renewable and regulatory transition moves forward. There is great interest in our state in doing everything we can to make Hawaii\u2019s economic recovery a green and sustainable recovery.",
         "Performance-based rate making, or PBR, continues on track for PUC decision this December, which we believe will lay out the core mechanisms and performance incentive mechanisms, or PIMs. A new step in the schedule has been added thereafter to enable development of tariffs to implement the new and changed mechanisms. The commission will determine when the new changes will be effective in 2021. We continue to aggressively advance efforts to help move our state towards 100% renewable energy and carbon neutrality. These efforts will also help provide jobs and construction activity to help our state recover from the impacts of COVID-19.",
         "This includes pursuing new sources of renewable energy through Hawaii\u2019s largest renewable procurements. In May, we announced the final selection of projects for our Stage 2 renewable energy RFP. We\u2019re excited to have 14 projects, all solar plus storage or storage only, from the original 16 selected moving forward through the contract negotiation and community engagement phase.",
         "If all are completed, they could add about 450 megawatts of solar and about 3 gigawatt hours of storage to our system. Two of the projects are company self-build storage projects on Maui and Hawaii Island. Stage 1 RFP projects also continue to advance. While some developers provided force majeure notices as a preventive measure given the possibility of COVID-19 interruptions, so far, all stage 1 projects are still moving forward.",
         "Last month, the commission approved our application to rebuild the Puna Geothermal Venture, or PGV, transmission line. This will allow us to bring PGV back on to our system under the existing PPA, while awaiting approval of our amended PPA.",
         "With land at a premium in Hawaii, we\u2019ll need to use both open land and as many rooftops as are available to reach our renewable energy goals. We\u2019re gathering information on parcels as small as 1 acre and rooftops of at least 3,200 square feet for future grid-scale solar and wind projects and community solar projects. We also continue working to help reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector.",
         "To help accelerate this transition, we filed a pilot project for eBUS make-ready infrastructure. And just this week, Hawaiian Electric announced its commitment to convert its entire fleet of light-duty vehicles across the islands, nearly 400 sedans, SUVs, small vans and light trucks to be electric by 2035, leading the state of Hawaii in electric vehicle fleets.",
         "Turning to our bank. In the second quarter, we stayed focused on doing the right things during this difficult time, ensuring employee and customer safety and well-being, supporting our customers, managing risk and controlling costs. We\u2019ve ramped up sanitation efforts and the use of PPE at all of our locations and workspaces, and we\u2019ve rolled out a new contactless card for all of our debit cardholders to keep them safe.",
         "We\u2019ve been able to help our customers manage economic uncertainty, offering fee suspensions and loan deferral and forbearance options, and providing Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP loans. Our team worked aggressively to secure and deploy PPP funding, delivering $370 million in loans for approximately 4,100 small businesses that represent roughly 40,000 jobs in our state. This accounted for the bulk of our loan growth in the quarter.",
         "At the bank, we have a front-row seat to the effects of federal stimulus with federal stimulus checks, leading to significant deposit growth, 24% on an annualized basis. This excess liquidity gives us added cushion during this COVID period, although it does pressure net interest margin. The bank\u2019s net interest margin was also impacted by the lower interest rate environment and PPP loans.",
         "Our core focus has been prudently managing our risk. Our team has been working closely with commercial customers to understand their financial condition and ensure we provision at the right levels, and we\u2019re controlling costs despite additional COVID related expenses. We\u2019re also taking advantage of new opportunities that this period presents. As an example, we\u2019ve seen rapid customer adoption of self-service options such as online banking and ATMs. This allows us to accelerate our plans for optimizing our branch footprint. We\u2019ve also started implementing our planned replacement of our ATM fleet with smart ATMs which will be the newest in Hawaii and will give customers even more capabilities outside the branches.",
         "Now Greg will review our results for the quarter and our outlook. Greg?",
         "Thanks, Greg. And mahalo, again. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Although this continues to be a difficult time for our community, we are proud of our companies and teams for stepping up to help our state navigate this crisis. The pandemic has highlighted how strong the foundation our company has built over many decades, and that has positioned us well to weather the storm.",
         "And now we look forward to hearing your questions."
      ],
      "Greg Hazelton": [
         "Thank you, Connie. Turning to our second quarter results on Slide 7. Consolidated earnings per share were $0.45 versus $0.39 in the same quarter last year. At the utility, timing and management of expenses and the PUC\u2019s grant of deferral treatment for COVID-19 related expenses had a positive impact. At the bank, strong mortgage production and a gain on sale of securities helped offset tighter lending margins and higher provision. At the holding company, while costs were well in line with plan, we did see a slight increase due to an acceleration, an increase in our charitable giving during the quarter to support our local community organizations and those impacted by COVID.",
         "Consolidated 12-month ROE remains healthy at 9.4%. Utility ROE increased 10 basis points versus the same time last year to 7.9%. Bank ROE, which we look at on an annualized rather than a trailing 12-month basis, was 8% for the quarter, down from last year due to economic impacts of COVID-19.",
         "Turning to the next slide. Utility earnings were $42.3 million compared to $32.6 million in the same quarter last year, reflecting, in part, savings due to process improvements and targeted cost reductions. The most significant drivers of the variance were $7 million lower operations and maintenance expenses, primarily due to fewer generating unit overhauls, less generating station maintenance work associated with overhauls, the reclassification of COVID-19-related bad debt expense from the first quarter of 2020 to a regulatory asset as a result of the PUC approval to defer these expenses and lower labor costs due to lower staffing levels and reduced over time. The lower generation overhauls and station maintenance work represented approximately $4 million of the $7 million O&M variance and are largely timing related as some of that work will be performed later this year or next year.",
         "Earnings also reflected a $5 million revenue increase from $4 million higher RAM revenues and $1 million for recovery of West Loch project and grid modernization projects under the MPIR mechanism. $1 million higher net income due to an unfavorable adjustment in 2019 related to reliability performance incentives and $1 million lower interest expense due to debt refinancings at lower rates. These items were slightly offset by the following after tax items: $1 million lower allowance for funds used during construction as we were \u2013 as there were fewer long-duration projects in construction work in progress; $1 million higher cost savings from ERP system implementation to be returned to customers; and $1 million higher depreciation due to increasing investments to integrate more renewable energy, improve customer reliability and strengthen system efficiency.",
         "Turning to the drivers of the utility\u2019s financial performance for the remainder of the year, the Public Utility Commission issued its final decision for our Hawaii Island Utility, confirming Hawaii Electric\u2019s 9.5% allowed ROE and 58% equity capitalization with no change to base rates. Separately, if the PUC approves our settlement with the consumer advocate in the Hawaiian Electric rate case for Oahu, we should see a similar outcome, no increase in base rates with 9.5% allowed ROE and 58% equity capitalization. The utility\u2019s multiyear strategy for greater operational efficiency and cost reductions should help offset the lack of base rate increases. The PUC order approving deferral of COVID-related expenses covers expenses incurred from March 17 to year-end.",
         "In the second quarter, we reclassified a pretax amount of $2.5 million in bad debt expense and \u2013 incurred in the first quarter to a regulatory asset. COVID related costs have been $6.5 million to date. A separate application will be filed to request recovery of such costs in the future. Although sales were down 11.6% versus the second quarter of last year, due to decoupling revenues, we were not significantly impacted. Substantial decreases in fuel prices have been positive for both the utility and customers. Steel prices were down close to 30% in the quarter, and the average customer bill declined by over $20 per month \u2013 monthly since the pandemic began. The utility may qualify for rewards this year under the fuel cost risk-sharing mechanism as well.",
         "On Slide 10, we continue to forecast approximately $360 million of CapEx during 2020. Last quarter, you may recall, we indicated the potential for up to $30 million below the forecast given potential COVID impacts. After a full quarter in the COVID environment, we have confidence in achieving the $360 million we forecast for the year. We\u2019re maintaining our longer-term CapEx and rate base guidance. In 2021 to 2022 period, we still expect CapEx to average approximately $400 million per year or about 2x depreciation. As you know, with capital projects, the timing of a specific project spend can sometimes shift between years. And the chart at the bottom left reflects some modest updates. Those updates don\u2019t change our overall guidance in the bar chart on the top left. We continue to expect the utility to be able to self-fund its forecasted CapEx through 2020 via retained earnings and access to the debt capital markets.",
         "Turning to the bank. American\u2019s net income was $14 million, down from $15.8 million in the prior quarter and $17 million in the same quarter last year. Net interest income was $56.7 million compared to $61.1 million in the linked quarter and $61.5 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower asset yields given the lower interest rate environment. Higher amortization of premiums within the mortgage-backed securities portfolio also impacted investment portfolio yield. Net income was also impacted by a higher provision for the quarter. ASB took an additional $7 million in credit reserves related to COVID as well as an additional $4 million for unfunded commitments.",
         "On the net income \u2013 noninterest income side, gains on sales of securities contributed positively to net income. We realized $7.1 million gain related to the sale of Visa Class B restricted shares and $2.2 million gain on the sale of investment securities as we sold some legacy positions to reduce credit risk and yield volatility in our investment portfolio.",
         "There were additional COVID-related expenses and savings within noninterest expense. American incurred $3.7 million in COVID-related expenses, consisting of additional pay to frontline employees, the payout of excess vacation days for employees unable to use vacation while working through the pandemic, purchases of PPE and sanitation supplies and employee meals purchased to promote employee safety and support small business restaurants. These higher COVID-related expenses were largely offset by lower travel, business development and marketing expenses.",
         "On Slide 12, ASB\u2019s net interest margin declined to 3.21% this quarter from 3.72% in the first quarter. On the upper right, we\u2019ve detailed the elements of that decline. The lower interest rate environment was the largest driver of the net interest margin compression, comprising 34 basis points of the decline. Much of this reflected anticipated repricing in Q2 of most of our adjustable and floating rate portfolio. 4 basis points was related to low-yielding PPP loans.",
         "FAS 91 amortization was also a large factor, reflecting a faster rate of prepayments due to lower rates at the long end of the curve. This accounted for 15 basis points of compression. We also realized strong deposit growth from the federal stimulus and unemployment benefits that added to cash deposit balances. While bolstering our liquidity and low-cost funding base, these temporary \u2013 the temporary excess liquidity is low-yielding and pressured margins. As noted, we did realize benefit from lower deposit costs, which contributed 8 basis points to net interest margin.",
         "Turning to bank drivers for the remainder of the year. We expect continued margin pressure, but at a more moderate pace than in the second quarter. In the second quarter, NIM compression compressed quickly as variable rate loans repriced after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate to near 0 in March. Approximately 93% of our variable rate portfolio have now repriced and indices to which those variable rates are tied are at or near their floors. Thus, we don\u2019t expect that part of our loan book to have materially impacted \u2013 be materially impacted by further NIM compression. We do expect continued refinancing of our fixed rate loan portfolio, such as home mortgages, as customers take advantage of historically low rates. This type of repricing is more gradual. Aside from continued low interest rates, we expect increased amortization in the investment portfolio to continue to impact net interest margin.",
         "As a reminder of how that impacts NIM, we purchased bonds for the investment portfolio at a premium or discount, and that premium or discount is amortized over the expected life of the bond\u2019s cash flows. For mortgage-backed securities, which comprise 90% of this portfolio, the amortization increases if prepayments accelerate. We see this occur in low interest rate environments as refinance activity increases. We expect excess liquidity to continue to pressure margins at similar levels to those realized this quarter as well. Given these factors, we now expect net interest margin to be in the 3.35% to 3.25% range for the year.",
         "Turning to the provision. As mentioned, we did have an additional provision further in the quarter related to COVID-19. The total provision recognized during the quarter was $15.1 million as reflected in our \u2013 on our income statement, which also included $4.3 million allowance related to unfunded commitments. As noted on the slide, reserves for unfunded commitments are recorded in other liabilities on the balance sheet rather than the allowance for credit losses. We believe we have approximately \u2013 we have appropriately provided for future credit losses as of June 30. The provision outlook for the balance of the year is dependent on the economic conditions, which at this point remain uncertain. We are not currently providing full year bank provision guidance given the uncertainty created by the impacts of COVID-19 on our economy.",
         "Slide 15 provides an update on what we\u2019re seeing in our loan portfolio. Overall, we have a high-quality loan book that remains healthy with only 3% of our borrowers requesting or qualifying for additional deferral thus far. Our residential book comprises approximately 60% of the loan portfolio, and the loan-to-value of that portfolio remains conservative at 52%. Only a small portion of that portfolio, roughly 8%, have requested payment relief.",
         "In consumer loans, which make up just over 4% of the overall portfolio, we\u2019ve seen a high-volume of deferment request but at low balances. While curtailment of supplemental unemployment benefits could result in increased deferment requests, we\u2019re closely monitoring what happens with additional federal stimulus. We have moved all commercial markets and CRE loans with payment deferrals to what is called special mention, meaning that those are subject to enhanced monitoring. These loans will be reevaluated for upgrade after successful resumption of payments.",
         "Given the enhanced monitoring we have implemented for the commercial markets and CRE loans as well as the overall quality of our loan book, we feel we are well provisioned as of June 30. ASB continues to maintain ample liquidity and healthy capital ratios despite the challenging economic condition. The bank has strong liquidity with over $3 billion available from a combination of FHLB and unencumbered securities. ASB\u2019s Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.4% was comfortably above well-capitalized levels at the end of the second quarter. As a reminder, the bank is self funding, and we don\u2019t expect to see a scenario in which it would need capital from the holding company.",
         "Turning to our consolidated liquidity. We are well positioned to withstand the impacts of COVID through the remainder of the year and beyond. As of June 30, we had $425 million of undrawn credit facility capacity, consisting of $150 million at the holding company and $275 million at the utility with just $16.5 million in commercial paper outstanding, all at the holding company. The utility paid off $14 million in long-term debt when it matured in July with no other long-term debt maturities until 2022. As of June 30, it had $65 million in unrestricted cash balances. In 2021, the utility has $50 million in short-term bank loan maturity and expects to access the debt capital markets to help fund its capital investment program. At the holding company, we have $50 million long-term debt and $65 million short-term bank term loan maturing in the first half of 2021, and we are currently planning refinancing options for those maturities.",
         "On Slide 18, we expect our dividend from the \u2013 from an equity investment in the utility to be consistent with our earlier projections as the utility continues to perform in line with plan and has sufficient retained earnings to support its capital investment requirements and adequate liquidity to support growth in the customer account receivable balances and payment programs for customers that are impacted by COVID-19. Although the dividend from ASB is lower than our pre-COVID outlook, bank dividends received to date are sufficient to maintain HEI\u2019s strong consolidated capital structure and liquidity. On Tuesday, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share at an annualized rate of $1.32 per share. We expect to maintain our external dividend and do not expect the need for additional equity at this time.",
         "We\u2019ve talked through the key drivers for the utility and the bank. And on Slide 19, you\u2019ll see our resulting guidance for the year. At the utility, we\u2019re reaffirming our guidance range and expect to be within the low end of the range. At the bank, we are continuing to provide pretax pre-provision income guidance, which includes net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense to range from $90 million to $110 million.",
         "We now expect mid-single-digit earning asset growth compared to low to mid-single-digit growth we previously forecasted. Given the current low interest rate environment and excess liquidity, we expect interest margin in the 3.25% to 3.35% range. Our holding company guidance is unchanged at $0.27 to $0.29 loss. Since it is still too early to determine bank provision, we\u2019re unable to provide consolidated EPS guidance at this time.",
         "I\u2019ll now turn it back to Connie for her closing remarks."

And then I think there\u2019s still activity that\u2019s out there, and we just \u2013 we need to make sure our risk appetite is in line with the opportunities that are in the market. So there is some good volume that\u2019s out there for projects that we think are worthwhile. And \u2013 but we\u2019re \u2013 we got to triple check our assumptions now, right?

So you can be sure that we will be carefully balancing future growth because, as Rich said, we definitely want to support the economic recovery here.

And then secondly, as we were coming in, the PPP, the dilution effect of the PPP as that came in, that \u2013 and the ongoing dilution effect of that depending \u2013 again, depending on how fast they forgive or pay off, that\u2019s still a variable that we\u2019ve got to watch as we go forward.

The other security sales, so we had planned in our year to probably have $3 million, $4 million of sales. There\u2019s roughly \u2013 those happen based on portfolio repositioning and other things like that, that are normal course. We\u2019ve gotten $3 million of that in the first half. We don\u2019t see a lot of other repositioning right now based on where rates are and where our holdings are, but that can change depending on our \u2013 what happens with any individual security that we\u2019re in and dame\u2019s desire, our CFO\u2019s desire to stay in or out of a security.

We don\u2019t know how fast they\u2019re going to spend them because this is uncharted territory. So we keep it very available, right? So if they\u2019re going to spend it and a lot of them were targeted to spend initially, as you know, in the quarter in order to get forgiveness, the original guidance was spend it all by June 30, right? So we kept it available in cash like instruments so that on a moment\u2019s notice, customers are spending it, the cash is there. So that we had the cost side, to your point, and no \u2013 very little income against them. So you dilute down the return on the overall book because you have a lot at near 0 net interest margin."

So we are less exposed to the riskier segments. So we have reasonably modest exposure to the hospitality industry and some of the other riskier ones. But the reality is our local economy is not \u2013 these are not hermetically sealed sectors, right? So when one area is suffering, even though we don\u2019t have a direct exposure to it, the community does. And so it affects the level of economic activity across the community.",

And then I \u2013 just on your question on reserving, the way the reserving is done now under CECL is that every quarter, at quarter end, when the bank puts up its provision, it\u2019s got to make a judgment call. And for the commercial loans, that is actually loan by loan as to what the potential expected losses would be over the life \u2013 the remaining life of the loan. So we feel good about the provision that we\u2019ve taken as of the second quarter, but come September 30, and the end of the next quarter, we got to make that determination again, and we got to take into account, now that it\u2019s over the expected life of the loan, what may happen in the economy going forward.
