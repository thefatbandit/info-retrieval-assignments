         "Good day, everyone, and welcome to Saab\u2019s Second Quarter and First-Half Year Results Presentation. I\u2019m Merton Kaplan, Head of Investor Relations. And with me today, I have our CEO, Mr. Micael Johansson; and CFO \u2013 acting CFO, Thomas Hendel.",
         "So before we start the presentation, I would like to remind you that we have our \u2013 we have a Q&A afterwards, where you can \u2013 we\u2019ll take questions from the audience, both from the teleconference and also take your questions that you post online. So yes, you can, during the presentation, post the questions through our IR website, and we\u2019ll try to answer those questions afterwards.",
         "So with that, I\u2019ll hand over to you, Micael.",
         "Thank you very much. Let\u2019s thank you both of you, Micael and Thomas. So now we are ready to open up the floor for questions and do some answers. And I would like to actually start \u2013 before I start, hand it over to the moderator. I would like to, as usual, remind you that for those who are going to ask questions, I recommend to ask one question at a time. And if you have more follow-up questions, please come back to the line, so we can answer those, too, and give everybody a chance. So I think we\u2019re ready and we give the moderator to open up and take the first questions from the teleconference."

      "Micael Johansson": [
         "Thank you so much, Merton. Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll walk you through the Q2 report and also the first-half year 2020. I must say still unusual times. I guess, this quarter has been one full quarter of the \u2013 the full effect of the COVID-19 that has been in play, and I will come back to comment about how that has affected Saab as well.",
         "But let\u2019s look at some of the highlights for the first-half year then. I think, I\u2019m really proud of the order intake situation. I think, we had a really strong first-half year with a 45% increase in order intake. And also for the second quarter was a really strong quarter with 76% or 77% increase compared to the second quarter last year.",
         "The growth of the small orders have continued, which shows that we have a high activity in the marketplace and we are able to finalize a lot of contracts that we initiated before the COVID-19 started.",
         "Also, in the \u2013 on the growth side, we had a strong quarter. The \u2013 we have a 5% growth compared to the second quarter 2019, and five out of six business areas showed growth. We\u2019ve had effects on the civilian side of the operations, and I will come back to that in a second.",
         "We had solid performance. We have a earnings development, which are absolutely in line with last year and also for the second quarter that was in line with the second quarter last year. I think, we have had the defense contributing positively, compensating for the problems we\u2019ve seen on the civilian side.",
         "And on the cost reduction side, of course, we have been working a lot to mitigating the effects on the civilian side, where we have to reduce our activity due to the airline, not the airline industry, but the industry working with aircraft delivers, which we are affected from. We\u2019re mitigating the cost situation on that side, but also the OpEx side of costs have been reduced considerably during the second quarter.",
         "And since we have grown, we have, of course, then been able to continue our execution on the major programs according to plan, which is really, really important to us. But also when it comes to the cash flow and payments, those programs are essential to us.",
         "So a few things on the execution side, I\u2019d like to mention our delivery of the first GlobalEye to UAE in April, a very strong milestone, which involved sort of an \u2013 the new way of delivering a system since we couldn\u2019t actually perform the tests in country, unless we had our personnel in quarantine for a couple of weeks. We had a fantastic team doing that staying in quarantine and then doing the test for a week and then being able to perform that milestone, which is also connected and, of course, to payments.",
         "We have been flying our new technology on the radar side and done a number of air trials on the Gripen CD, which is the absolutely state-of-the-art electronic steered antenna technology, and that is now ready to be implemented in future platforms and also, of course, upgrades for the CD platform.",
         "We have done tests on the very important Lightweight Torpedo, both from a Gotland-class submarine, but also from VISBY Corvette, and we have checked a number of things now and that is going according to plan. And we have two important contracts with Sweden and Finland regarding that Lightweight Torpedo.",
         "And you read a lot of the situation in Brazil about actually, we have been continuing our activities according to plan in Brazil as well, and we have now started the production of essential parts of the fighter Gripen E and the dual seated F version in Brazil. The forward fuselage, the aft fuselage, the tail cone and some parts of the wings as well, so that is up and running and will be an essential production site for us going forward.",
         "One extremely important thing that we have completed now during the second quarter is the divestment of the \u2013 our shares in our joint venture in the U.S. on the 3D mapping technology with Vricon company. That was something we entered into in 2015, and we have now exited and capitalized on that technology development well in a market that we couldn\u2019t access, but we have capitalized on that. And still, we have the technology in our house to continue on our applications on the defense side. So that is a big achievement, I think.",
         "And then we have an important program on the Combat Air System side in the UK, our relationship with UK industry and under the MoU between Sweden and the UK. And that is moving ahead really well despite COVID-19 and restrictions in traveling. And we will now enter into a situation, where we will discuss the trilateral partnership with the Italian industry as well. So it\u2019s been an intensive first-half year in an intensive quarter, which I\u2019m really, really pleased with.",
         "Looking at COVID-19, then to give you some updates on that, I sort of alluded to that. We have had limited impact on the defense side, I must say. We have all the sites in Sweden more or less up and running according to normal standards. Our employees have been doing a tremendous job keeping our operations up and running.",
         "Of course, we have followed all the recommendations and guidelines and restrictions that the authorities have provided. And the health of our personnel is the primary thing to work with, of course, but that has been going really, really well.",
         "We have had sites outside Sweden on the complete lockdown, for example, Germany and South Africa was out two weeks on the defense side, but many other sites have been working according to plan. So we have been able to continue to work on our major programs and delivered, as I said.",
         "On the civilian side of our business, which is roughly 15% of Saab\u2019s revenue, especially related to aviation industry or Aerostructures organization in Link\u00f6ping and also our systems on the \u2013 what we call our Traffic Management systems for airports and air navigation service providers, those have been affected dramatically. And as you can see in our numbers of business, our IPS have been affected a lot.",
         "We are now taking mitigating activities, of course, to make sure that we can reduce our cost situation in those areas and essentially move personnel from the civilian side into the defense side and, sort of lower the number of consultants from external companies that we have in the organization. So we tried to mitigated that way.",
         "We are working hard on the supply chain side of things. We are not just in time type of company, as you know. We have substantial stock to work sort of short-term with our major programs. But we have to make sure that they are up and running to deliver to us for years to come.",
         "So this is a very complex material and some companies are, of course, up and running again reasonably well. Others having problems in different parts of the world, and we have a global supply chain. So this is a key thing to work with for us going forward. We have worked a lot, of course, with the financial flexibility during the quarter. We have a strong financial situation now with the credits we have available and also cash.",
         "So \u2013 and also we \u2013 as you know, we \u2013 the Annual General Meeting decided not to do a dividend as planned for this year. And that is something also affecting our financial flexibility, of course. So we\u2019re doing a lot of mitigating actions, but generally speaking, we have been doing quite well apart from the civilian side.",
         "Some market highlights. Well, I would say that I haven\u2019t seen any signs of that, our customers are refraining from continuing their procurement programs and acquisition programs. And that has also shown through our strong order intake situation. They \u2013 we have concluded contracts and have a good order intake.",
         "Many of these things were, of course, initiated before COVID-19. And fortunately, we have a strong marketing organization and many own employees in many different countries around the world that can continue to have interaction with our customers, that has led to the order intake.",
         "Business development is a little bit more difficult, of course, but we\u2019re doing that as well, as far as possible. It\u2019s hard to predict how things will go. But I can\u2019t see any changes in the marketplace in terms of that countries will avoid continuing with protecting their societies and protecting their countries. And the geopolitical situation is not going really in the right direction. It\u2019s actually becoming a bit worse during the COVID-19.",
         "So I see still our prospects being extremely valid going forward. But we have seen commercial market activity, of course on the airline side have dramatically been reduced, of course, but that is a limited part of Saab.",
         "A number of good things have happened during the quarter. We\u2019ve signed a new Airborne Early Warning contract, a big one and that is important to us. We have framework contracts for the shoulder weapons and support weapons side, both in the U.S. and in other countries, and that has been successful to us.",
         "And we announced yesterday that we had a new contract from the U.S., almost SEK 1.930 million, which is fantastic, and that framework contract is SEK 4.5 billion in total, and this was the second lot that was ordered from that. We\u2019ve also had a couple of important support contracts in Sweden, both for the Gripen and but also to the extension of the training aircraft, SK60, that will now continue to be in operations until 2025.",
         "And we have also had good contracts in the U.S. being a country that actually moved things forward a bit to support the defense industry in that country. So we\u2019ve had not unexpected, but earlier radar orders then what we thought would happen during the quarter. That is really good.",
         "And yesterday, we also announced another contract on the Airborne Early Warning side, the support contract for the GlobalEye in UAE, that will be registered now in Q3 and not in the second quarter, but that is also a big win to us.",
         "So in sort of summarizing what this means in numbers then looking at the first-half year to start with really good order bookings 45% up, as you said, and the sales is in line with the first-half of 2019, and also the operating income is in line with the first-half. So they \u2013 the first quarter this year was a little bit down, but the second quarters is a bit up. And all in all, we came to sort of the same level as 2019, despite the sort of the effects of COVID-19.",
         "And operational cash flow has improved dramatically, as I was commenting also after the Q1. We were seeing sort of an improvement also in Q2, which we have seen. Now, we will go into a little bit more detail to clarify exactly how the underlying cash flow looks like in a minute.",
         "If we then continue to the quarterly development, this is a very strong quarter. From the revenue side, I would say, it\u2019s one of the best ever for Saab, if not the best, and also when it comes to order booking, so an extremely strong quarter. And that is the same for the operating income.",
         "Operational cash flow, a big shift now to positive SEK 1.8 billion positive operational cash flow. That has, however, been affected by the deferral of tax and social fees that\u2019s been available for us from the Swedish government. But even with exclusion of that, we have SEK 600 million positive operational cash flow for the second quarter.",
         "I will reiterate that, even if we have said again that we will not give an outlook for 2020, we will stick by our judgment that we made after the Q1. It\u2019s difficult to predict. Again, the effects of the COVID-19 in different countries and markets and the supply chain specifically is something we have to work with in a meticulous way now going forward. But we do stick by our long-term financial targets of 5% organic growth and 10% operating margin definitely. And our strategy remains. It\u2019s built upon a number of other perspectives, where our employees is the most important one, of course.",
         "But when it comes to our portfolio, I think, one development that we have done now is then to divest our shares on the vehicle side, which is about portfolio management, of course. But also we continue to make sure that everything we do on the portfolio side is connected to our core areas going forward. So that initiatives in taking decisions on what is actually core to us continues as well.",
         "On the international expansion side in the marketplace, the strategic partnerships on the Future Combat Air System is really important to us, and we\u2019re taking new steps in that direction now when the FCAS project, together with the UK, is intensifying. We have also done, as I said, started our market footprint to a large extent in Brazil with our production up and running now in Brazil going forward.",
         "Automation digitalization is absolutely key to us. We work that everyday. A new technology will mean a lot to our core systems and core areas going forward. And we are on our toes to investing in these areas continuously to make sure that we can do things with our core systems in a new way using new technology.",
         "So I just want to reiterate that this strategy is in place and we have lots of initiatives following our strategy pushing forward and we stick by our long-term financial targets.",
         "And with that, I think, I will hand over to our acting CFO, Thomas Hendel."

      "Thomas Hendel": [
         "Thank you, Micael. Let\u2019s go into more details on the financials. We had a solid performance in the defense-related business for the first-half, especially the second quarter, as Micael has said, and that is, of course, the majority of the business.",
         "We had a good order intake in the Q2 SEK 14.1 billion, almost compared to the SEK 9.7 billion for the first-half, which is the 45%. Also, we normally monitor very much and follow-up the small orders, and now we have 9% up for the half year versus the half year last year, and it\u2019s also in second quarter as such is 14% up actually, so it\u2019s very good.",
         "We have a sales, which is very much in line with last year, despite the drop in, in the IPS business, i.e., the civil business, and we have the organic growth in the second quarter of 5%. And then we have stable earnings and in the both quarters, and so for the half year, coming from the positive volume effect in the defense side, but also impact from cost reduction actions, that also Micael mentioned, and that is all \u2013 both in the cost of goods sold area and also OpEx.",
         "We have an improved cash flow in the second quarter, and I will come back to that in a minute in more details for the analysis. We have a strong financial position. We acted early end of Q1 and early Q2 to secure the liquidity in the light of the COVID-19 situation. And also that we signed, as you might remember, an extra revolving credit facility also around that timing.",
         "Backlog duration, which is a KPI that we closely monitor, and it\u2019s very important for us, of course. We have to execute the rest of the year SEK 15.6 billion to add to the first-half of sales. And then we have also, as you see, starting to strengthen our backlog now for 2021. So that is also going to plan.",
         "Order size distribution, we already talked about that. But what I wanted to point out with this slide this time is actually that we are now approaching the book-to-bill ratio 1, as you see, and that is quite sometime since we were close to the one on the book and bill ratio.",
         "Order bookings by business area, the \u2013 once again, the strong growth, encouraging that we increased the volume, both from small and larger orders, and the growth is very much driven by Dynamics, Surveillance and Support and Services deal.",
         "Sales stable volumes year-over-year. Stronger Q2, 5% up in Q2 in \u2013 and that is actually five out of six business areas that shows growth in the second quarter. High activity level in \u2013 from our backlog and also encouraging to see what we have said earlier here that Dynamics is starting to pick up in their deliveries, which is very important for us in the second quarter. And then IPS, there we see the downturns starting to see that even if Combitech made a good performance at the end of Q2.",
         "Operating income very much affected. Now, IPS is very obvious in this slide. Strong improvement in Dynamics and Surveillance. And also that we still have \u2013 we\u2019re to mention Aeronautics and Support and Services at a high level \u2013 stable level according to plan. And also, we have seen all \u2013 despite there\u2019s still on the low level, but we have productivity measures implemented in Kockums and where we also see starting to give effect.",
         "Cash flow. Yes, we are improving. We have improved cash generation. We had a good collection in the quarter, mainly from meeting payment milestones and deliveries in our major programs. We have then lower levels of working capital. And now starting to see the PoC receivables/contract assets starting to decrease, as we have mentioned quite sometime now.",
         "Then, we have this, let\u2019s say, one-time positive effect from the deferrals that Micael mentioned. Continued investment was pretty high level on both fixed assets and capitalized R&D investments, which is according to plan, of course. And then further deliveries are planned for 2020, which is a key for us to generate cash flow.",
         "And we reconfirm that we have a continued ambition to near \u2013 generate positive operational cash flow for 2020. And here, I like to stress that this is without any one-off effects from the deferrals that we still reconfirm our continued ambition on the operational cash flow side.",
         "I should also mention that we \u2013 the cash from the Vricon divestment was actually received after the Q2 closing about SEK 1 billion. The net debt situation is pretty much stable, basically reflecting the free cash flow for the first-half year. And we have \u2013 and the net debt of SEK 7.4 billion, you should \u2013 then we should see that we have \u2013 out of that, the net pension obligation is actually SEK 4.8 billion out of the SEK 7.4 billion, which is important information.",
         "The equity asset ratio is strong 36.2%, which is actually one of our long-term targets as well to be ahead of the 30% equity ratio. And then we have an improved cash situation now, where we have the SEK 10 billion on unutilized revolving credit facilities and when we \u2013 end of Q2, we also had cash on about SEK 6.3 billion.",
         "So finally, focus, like always, execution delivery of projects is key for us. We need to secure targeted orders in certain areas, continued productivity measures and managed cost and growth and the cash flow generation, mainly from meeting the payment milestones in the large programs, but also increased deliveries in our product business.",
         "So by that, if we can leave over to Merton."

But I wondered when you would expect to pay those, because it\u2019s clearly not a \u2013 clearly not being let off that particular obligation. Is that something we should expect to see as a cash outflow next year? Thank you."

But I mean, the rules for that is that, the deferrals that we have been entitled to use for this quarter can then be paid back in a year\u2019s time. But it\u2019s important and exactly when we will do that, I will not comment upon, but it\u2019s important to state what Thomas just said, that we will absolutely have the ambition to generate the positive cash flow without sort of taking that into account, having these deferrals this year. So that is as far as I would go right now."

            "Well, I think, if you start with the Gripen side, we \u2013 we\u2019re doing really well. We haven\u2019t sort of said that much about that, but we have now started to fly another aircraft during this quarter and the program is running well. Now, we\u2019re adding sort of tactical functionality to the program, and we are going to deliver the first aircraft to Brazil this year into Brazil, and then they will continue to get a few aircrafts next year and also the Swedish deliveries will start. So I\u2019m really pleased with that.",
            "The GlobalEye program has been running absolutely according to plan and we have achieved our milestones as we\u2019ve mentioned. And we have the T7, the training aircraft in the \u2013 together with Boeing in the U.S. I would say that, that so-called industrialization phase that is ongoing will now lead to the first delivery of our aft fuselage parts to U.S. during the fall.",
            "And then from the end of next year, we\u2019ll start sort of doing outputs from our production facility, West Lafayette, Indiana, also going really well, and the construction is going according to plan. So I\u2019ve seen pictures, I can\u2019t travel right now, but I\u2019ve seen pictures of walls and roofs and the inside of the building, at least.",
            "Apart from that, we have the Squadron 2020, the command and control in the sensor side with the Finnish Navy, also running according to plan in a very good way. So I would say program after program, and I think the quarter shows that has been running according to plan and we have met our milestones."

I have visited twice myself now and it\u2019s looking really well.",

And we start seeing effects now in a very positive way, I must say, during this quarter. As you might know as well that the defense forces have taken delivery of the first Gotland-class submarine during the quarter as well. So we delivered well on that as well."

Regarding the order momentum, you have seen quite good order intake in the past quarter. What is your outlook for the rest of the year? How you\u2019re doing? Do you see any hesitance at government with regards to spending on defense in an environment, where they need to put some money on kicking \u2013 kick starting the economies, so starting with that?"

            "And so I think the marketplace is still very active. I mean, there\u2019s a slight problem getting face time with the customers, of course. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to have people at sites of, say, internationally to work with them. It\u2019s a bit frustrating not being able to travel the same way as usual from our main hubs.",
            "But I would say that country seems to be focusing on protecting their societies and protecting their countries and continuing with the programs that we\u2019ve seen. So we have many prospects still to work with, during the remaining part of the year and going forward. And we have large campaigns as well like the Gripen campaigns in Finland and Canada, and also hopefully, continuing with the Gripen in Brazil. So the market activity is really high. I can\u2019t see any signs of that sort of going in the wrong direction."

Then we\u2019ve had, of course, traffic management, air traffic management systems, where we deliver command and control systems to the air navigation service providers and airports to manage the air traffic in the vicinity of the airport, optimize that, and that has also been affected rather dramatically.",

Will there be eruptions of infections again, which will require countries to take initiatives \u2013 will \u2013 which will affect sort of lockdown? Will we see lockdowns again? Hard to predict. I can\u2019t judge. But we look upon sort of the civilian part. Supply chain is critically important as well around the world. Those are the main things we work with."
