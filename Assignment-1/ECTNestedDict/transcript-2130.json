      "D.G. Macpherson": [
         "Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. To say that this quarter was different and challenging would be an understatement. I am very proud of how our leadership and team members have stepped up to the challenge. Whether dealing with the pandemic or with social injustice issues, our team has been fantastic throughout this uncertain time.",
         "Let me start off by providing you with an update on our pandemic response and a brief overview of the quarter before turning it over to Tom to dive into the details. So starting with an update on the pandemic, the Grainger team continues to work tirelessly to keep the world working during this challenging time.",
         "As I outlined on our first quarter call, Grainger is an essential business, and our customers count on us to keep their businesses up and running. Our pandemic response is wrapped in three broad priorities: First, serve our customers well through this challenging time; second, support the needs and safety of our team members; and third, ensure we remain in a strong financial position. I\u2019ll provide a quick update on each point.",
         "First, our businesses remained open every day to serve our customers. I visited one of our DCs last week, and we have implemented several measures to protect the safety of team members and to ensure the continuity of our operations. We also recently reopened our branch showrooms to add to the curbside pickup service we have been operating throughout the pandemic. Our KeepStock team members continue to serve the vast majority of our customers. The exception would be some disruptive businesses where we\u2019ve had to flip to alternate solutions.",
         "Throughout, our team is focused on customer and team member safety, including new protocols, temperature checks, space covering mandates and social distancing guidelines. This has certainly made operating more difficult, but we believe we have done very well with these changes. On the customer front, business reopenings and related activity continue to vary greatly based on industry and geography.",
         "Sales to health care, government and other essential businesses remained strong throughout the quarter. Sales to non-essential and disruptive businesses bottomed in April, and they\u2019ve rebounded in May and again in June, although they still remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels. I\u2019ll talk about the pattern of revenue in a minute.",
         "Our supply chain has operated well throughout the pandemic although we have seen some lumpiness as we work to match supply with tremendous demand for some pandemic-related items. For most product categories, things have improved. But for some categories, global shortages will make supply a challenge throughout the balance of the year. Our team is working tirelessly to ensure supply for customers as the pandemic ebbs and flows.",
         "As we mentioned before, supporting the needs of our team members is a critical importance, especially during this period of uncertainty. Our team members are essential to serving our customers, and team member health and safety remains a priority. We have been fortunate to have absorbed the pandemic without major layoffs and currently have less than 3% of our workforce still on furlough. We have more team members who will return to work in the next few weeks. Having an experienced cohesive team will help us accelerate growth through the recovery.",
         "In addition, we remain vigilant around safety. Our team members give us great marks for making safety a priority as they support our customers. Finally, we have maintained a tight focus on our financial position throughout this period. On our Q1 call, I discussed our priority to preserve cash, including deferring action on certain capital projects, pausing our share repurchase program and drawing on our revolving credit facility.",
         "We continue to focus on cash preservation and have reduced non-essential SG&A spend by over $75 million sequentially in the quarter. That more than exceeds our $40 million to $55 million target set on the previous call. These actions helped us to finish the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity. Since the business performed well in the quarter, we have begun to evaluate repaying part of the revolver and are assessing a potential dividend increase.",
         "Depending on the shape of the pandemic, we will see some sequential cost increases related to things like advertising, some travel and the reinstitution of merit increases. But we remain committed to managing expenses very closely given the uncertain path ahead. To be clear, we are managing costs well, but also investing for the future success of the business. We continue focusing balancing the long-term health of the company alongside our short-term operational needs.",
         "Turning to our quarterly results. The business remained resilient despite this unprecedented period. Our daily sales finished down 1.8% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, underpinned by heightened sales of pandemic-related items that nearly offset a mid-teen decline of non-pandemic-related sales. With the MRO market down 14% to 15% in the quarter, we gained a lot of share fueled by pandemic-related sales, selling to new customers and improving non-pandemic sales as the quarter progressed.",
         "Gross margins were pressured primarily due to pandemic impacts, which Tom will detail in a bit. A meaningful portion of this margin pressure is temporary in nature, what we don\u2019t know is how long the pandemic will last. Despite great SG&A performance, we have taken action to keep team members and customers safe that have added some short-term costs.",
         "Obviously, we\u2019re incurring expense to ensure we create safe work spaces and interact, but also doing things like expediting shipping and allocating product to lower-margin health care and government customers. To state the obvious, we have been focused on helping customers and communities as much as possible, which sometimes means we have added cost. We\u2019ve produced $230 million of operating cash flow and $189 million of free cash flow. That\u2019s a solid result in this environment.",
         "Balancing the short-term with progress in strategic initiatives has been key. We continue to make progress on our key priorities. We are on plan to remerchandise an incremental $1.6 billion of our assortment this year. To support further acceleration of these activities, we plan to launch our new product information management system over the next month. We have made great strides in analytics and marketing capabilities, including upgrading internal talent to own more of the marketing activities.",
         "Our new customer information tools have enabled us to better match marketing and sales activities with new customers. We launched a new visual search application that is based on machine learning. We are getting great reviews on this solution. We are seeing continued traction with our KeepStock and other embedded customer solutions. We know that customers who have at least one embedded solution, including KeepStock and EDI Pro account for roughly 60% of our revenue. So this is an important customer segment.",
         "Here, we have upgraded our systems and processes to accelerate new installations and improve service on existing solutions. With our endless assortment model, MonotaRO continued to invest in technology and capacity to fuel their growth, while we have started to see the benefits of last year\u2019s investments at Zoro in the U.S. And lastly, we further refined our international high-touch footprint with the completed divestiture of Fabory, and we announced an agreement to divest Grainger China. This helps us simplify our footprint and focus our efforts on our core markets.",
         "Looking at Slide 6, I thought it would be important this quarter to show the underlying trends with pandemic and non-pandemic products based on our current categorization of SKUs. Over the last several weeks, I\u2019ve been participating in virtual market visits with customers that were originally scheduled to be in person. I have talked with dozens of customers in several different industries to get a sense for how things are progressing.",
         "It\u2019s important to note that even for customers with strong revenue performance, there has been a disruption in normal activities. For example, our hospital system has been heroic in dealing with the pandemic and saving lives, and their pandemic product demand has been enormous. But many of their normal facilities maintenance projects have been put on hold through this time to focus on COVID, which means that even hospitals had lower non-pandemic sales through the last four months. There\u2019s a backlog of work that will need to be done in the future. But for now, customers in all industries are focusing on keeping people safe and recovery.",
         "In the U.S., we started to see increased pandemic sales in February, and they really picked up in March, where we quickly moved in-stock inventory. This trend continued with pandemic-related sales up around 70% in the second quarter. And while the environment remains fluid, this has continued at an accelerated rate into July. The heightened demand came from a multitude of customers across numerous industries with most of the pandemic products going to health care, government and essential businesses.",
         "Through most of March, non-pandemic sales were pretty stable. With the stay-at-home orders, we saw non-pandemic sales fall off significantly in late March, but they have gotten better each month since modeled out in April. We\u2019ve seen further improvement in July. The good news is that we have seen a steady improvement in non-pandemic revenue across all customer types. It\u2019s still below pre-pandemic levels, but it has improved. While we don\u2019t know how this will progress, we do feel good about our ability to help customers weather the storm regardless of how the pandemic evolves.",
         "So with that, I will turn it over to Tom to take us through the quarter\u2019s results in detail. Tom?",
         "Thanks, Tom. Before we wrap up the call and go to questions, I want to touch on an important topic. The recent events of hatred and racism stand as reminders of the injustice in our world, and particularly for the African-American community. At Grainger, one of our core principles is to do the right thing. The right thing here seems fundamental: respect each other, embrace our differences and stand out for what is right. Remaining silent is not an option.",
         "Collectively, we need to be better. As a company, we know that diversity, inclusion and acceptance of our differences makes us stronger. This is central to our Grainger Edge principles and vital to our commitment to keep the world working. We have been encouraging our team members to have real conversations with each other about their background and identity, including the tough topics of race, gender, age and sexual orientation so that we can better know and understand each other.",
         "We know these conversations alone are not sufficient to solving the problem, and we need to collectively take action to ensure that economic opportunities are more plentiful for all. While we have work to do, we are committed to improving our talent and recruiting processes to root out bias, and we\u2019re committed to promoting diverse hiring opportunities. This includes giving clear metrics and visibility, ensuring equitable pay and helping team members address unconscious bias.",
         "We\u2019ll also continue to direct an arm of our charitable efforts to promote the educational advancement of those without privilege or access. I want to thank our team and our customers for performing so well through the pandemic. We are pleased with how we performed, and we remain committed to gaining share profitably and delivering strong results moving forward.",
         "Now with that, I\u2019ll open it up for questions."

         "Good morning. Welcome to Grainger\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, SVP and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings.",
         "Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures and their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q2 press release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning\u2019s call will focus on adjusted results for the second quarter of 2020, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings press release.",
         "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to D.G."
      ],
      "Operator": [
         "Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.",
         "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Holman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin."
      ],
      "Tom Okray": [
         "Thanks, D.G. Starting with our total company results. As noted on Slide 8, daily sales were down 1.8% on a constant-currency basis. This decline was primarily driven by volume decreases, reflecting lower sales of non-pandemic products as well as significant headwinds from unfavorable product mix due to heightened sales of pandemic-related products. It should be noted that our endless assortment business grew approximately 16% in the quarter, showing tremendous resiliency despite the challenging market conditions.",
         "Combined, the U.S. segment and endless assortment business representing the majority of our revenue grew daily sales about 1% in the quarter and roughly 4% year-to-date. Gross margin for the total company was down 290 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. This decline continues to be driven mostly by pandemic-related impacts, particularly noticeable in our U.S. segment, as well as continued business unit mix impact as we experienced faster growth in our lower-margin endless assortment business.",
         "We gained 100 basis points of SG&A leverage with a total year-over-year cost decrease of $43 million. This leverage stemmed from prudent cost reductions across all business units, partially offset by increased pandemic-related costs to keep our people and facilities safe. Sequentially, total SG&A spend decreased over $75 million, exceeding our previously communicated goal of $40 million to $55 million, a great result as we were able to deliver better-than-expected savings in many areas of the business.",
         "We generated operating cash flow of $232 million, which we used to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and maintain a robust financial position. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $86 million to shareholders, had total capital expenditures of $43 million and significantly invested in inventory to ensure we can satisfy our customers\u2019 needs going forward.",
         "Operating cash flow was 114% of net adjusted earnings and return on invested capital was over 28% year-to-date. As expected, our liquidity has remained strong, and we are evaluating increasing our dividend and beginning to repay our revolver draw. I would note, our calculated decremental margins are a bit skewed given the modest level of sales decline. While the decremental margin calculation is useful, it has limitations with relatively small sales declines.",
         "For example, if our sales would have declined 10% in the quarter with the same gross margin and SG&A spending, our business results would, in fact, be worse, but our decremental margins would have improved from down 111% to down 50%. Overall, U.S. segment daily sales decreased 2.4% in the quarter as compared to a decline of an estimated 14% to 15% for the broader MRO market. The decline was primarily driven by volume decreases, including unfavorable product mix from heightened levels of pandemic-related sales as well as decreased volume of non-pandemic products.",
         "In the U.S. segment, we estimate that pandemic-related product sales were up over 70% in the quarter, peaking in May but elevated throughout the quarter. Non-pandemic products were down in the mid-teens but saw sequential improvements from April lows. Gross margin was 310 basis points unfavorable to the prior year. The variance was driven primarily by three factors: pandemic-related headwinds, tariff fuel cost inflation and the impact of our rescheduled national sales meeting.",
         "First, while difficult to pinpoint, we estimate that pandemic-related headwinds accounted for approximately 60% of the gross margin decline in the quarter. These headwinds are multifaceted and include product mix impacts as well as we continued to sell significantly increased levels of lower-margin safety and cleaning products skewed more toward larger health care and government customers.",
         "Additionally, as we work to support our customers during this challenging time, we saw further margin pressure as we sourced high-demand products from non-traditional suppliers. This included increased freight and handling costs to ensure expedient delivery of these much-needed and critical supplies. These dramatic but temporary pandemic-related impacts are not expected to continue once we return to more normal course operation.",
         "The remaining gross margin decline was primarily driven by the lapping of year-over-year cost inflation, which was largely driven by tariffs that went into effect in 2019 Finally, our national sales meeting represents a roughly 30-basis-point headwind related to the reformatting and retiming of the meeting. From an SG&A perspective, we gained 60 basis points of leverage with costs decreasing approximately $25 million year-over-year. The decrease was driven primarily by lower travel expenses as well as reductions in marketing, labor-related costs, professional services and general frugality.",
         "These decreases more than offset temporary pandemic pay increases for hourly branch and DC team members, and enhanced safety measures in our facilities. Operating margin remained strong at 14.7%, but declined 250 basis points in the quarter on lower gross profit margins that were only slightly offset by the achieved SG&A leverage. Return on invested capital was a very healthy 38%.",
         "Looking at the U.S. MRO market, while extremely difficult to predict in this environment, we estimate the U.S. MRO market declined between 14% and 15% in the second quarter. Ranger was able to capture roughly 1,200 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, a 70% increase compared to the first quarter share increase. It should be noted that despite the pandemic, year-to-date daily sales are up 1.6%, and we have gained over 900 basis points of share.",
         "Moving on to the other businesses. Daily sales in our other businesses increased 2.7% or 2.5% on a constant-currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at \u2013 grew combined at 16% year-over-year, driven by strong customer acquisition at MonotaRO and low single-digit growth at Zoro. MonotaRO continues to perform at an impressive rate despite the Japanese recession and amidst the pandemic backdrop.",
         "Sales at Zoro accelerated throughout the quarter, with June up near 10% and July growing at an even faster rate. The international high-touch businesses have been severely impacted by pandemic-related shutdowns, with each geography experiencing meaningful year-over-year declines.",
         "Gross profit margin declined 140 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by declining margins at Fabory and MonotaRO. MonotaRO\u2019s result is driven in part by freight increases from the acquisition of new B2C customers. We achieved significant SG&A leverage in the second quarter, resulting in operating margin expansion of 65 basis points.",
         "The SG&A favorability stems largely from decreased expenses across our international high-touch businesses, most notably at Cromwell, and expanded leverage in endless assortment. It is notable that despite some gross margin headwinds at MonotaRO, the endless assortment business grew operating margin in the second quarter. It is encouraging to see the 2019 investments in Zoro paying off.",
         "Further, despite significant top line challenges in 2020, Cromwell has meaningfully reduced its operating loss year-to-date. On June 30, we completed the sale of the Fabory business, the full operating results of this business are included in our second quarter results. Given the immateriality of the business, we will not be recasting our prior-year financials to reflect this transaction. So we will face revenue headwinds, but we\u2019ll have a modest tailwind to operating margin rate comparisons over the next four quarters. Starting in the third quarter, we will provide organic daily revenue comparisons to strip out the top line impact of the divestiture.",
         "Turning to Slide 12. In Canada, daily sales decreased 21.7% or 19% in constant currency. The decline is comprised of roughly 17.5% in volume and price headwinds, including customer mix of approximately 1.5%. Volumes at the Grainger Canada business continued to be impacted by the economic slowdown and lower oil prices stemming from the pandemic.",
         "Gross profit margin at Grainger Canada declined 145 basis points year-over-year, driven by the combination of aggressive pricing actions aimed at reinvigorating our customer base, pandemic-related mix impacts and lower vendor rebates. These impacts were partially offset by lower freight costs. Our cost management actions drove SG&A savings of $12 million year-over-year, resulting in 60 basis points of leverage. Operating margin was unfavorable 85 basis points versus prior year.",
         "Before I turn it back to D.G., given the unpredictability of the virus, it remains nearly impossible to predict how customers \u2013 how our customers will be impacted, but wanted to give you a sense for how July is unfolding and what it might mean for the third quarter. From a sales perspective, trends in early July are showing sales up mid-single digits on an organic total company basis, which strips out sales from our Fabory business.",
         "July-to-date trends show continued momentum with non-pandemic sales gaining steam from April lows and with pandemic-related sales remaining at elevated levels. Further, every business unit is showing improved performance in July when compared to June results. The situation clearly remains volatile. And as we saw in Q1, these month-to-date metrics may not be good predictors of our full quarter results.",
         "As we move into the second half of 2020, we anticipate gross margins will remain depressed as we expect pandemic-related impacts will continue. While we don\u2019t know how the situation will evolve as the year goes on, given what we know now, we anticipate improvement from the 290 basis point year-over-year headwind we saw in Q2, but to what extent will be largely dependent on the pandemic-related actions of our customers.",
         "With respect to SG&A, as business unit activity ramps up, we expect to see some natural increases in spend related to marketing and travel, and we also reinstituted our annual merit increase, which was pushed from April to July. With this, we anticipate total company SG&A cost to range from $715 million to $730 million in the third quarter. Importantly, we remain focused on long-term growth, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in people, process and technology to ensure we remain the industry leader.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to D.G. for some final thoughts."

But my question is, could you give us an update on your efforts in high touch? What initiatives are you driving on most right now to accelerate growth in that core business?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Thanks, David. I think they are the same things we\u2019ve talked about in terms of being critical, and they really fall into two groups. One is improving our offer, our product assortment, our product information, our customer information. So we\u2019re rolling out a new product information management system. We are remerchandising a bunch of the assortment to make the experience better for our customers. We continue to invest in digital technology for our website. So that\u2019s kind of the first set of things we\u2019re doing.",
            "We\u2019ve also increased our marketing effectiveness and reimproved our digital marketing, which is both \u2013 which really hits all customers within the Grainger model, the high-touch model, and that has been very effective. And we\u2019ve reinvigorated our KeepStock and on-site solutions for customers. We have a good traction going into the fourth quarter of last year and the beginning of this year.",
            "Some of that\u2019s slowed down, but we still have new installs. We still have changed some installs for customers to help serve them during this time. And really we think that almost every large complex customer has either a digital solution that works for them or we help to manage inventory. And so we\u2019re pushing on those basics of on-site service to make sure we do that right. And all that is leading to a strong share gain within the U.S. business."

And obviously, great timing on those. As we look to the future, will those kind of investments be less chunky ahead? Or will you periodically step those spending initiatives up and then followed by a period of harvesting the benefits?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. We would expect that to be less chunky. And the reason is a lot of the investments we made over the last 15 months or so, mostly in 2019, were really about a fairly significant strategic change to expand the assortment in the millions of products. We passed the 4.4 million products available to customers online Mazuro recently, and we\u2019ve got a great pipeline. That required us to do it very, very differently than we\u2019ve done historically. And so those investments are behind us. And I would expect them to be less chunky. We have \u2013 for the next three to five years, we will continue to expand margins with that business as we grow, given where we positioned ourselves right now."

         "Speaker": "Ryan Merkel"
      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, so it\u2019s a great question, Ryan. Yes, there is \u2013 I mean, well, visibility in the traditional sense, I\u2019m not sure. But certainly, if you look at our customer base, there are customers now who have planned, particularly PPE, into their process like they\u2019ve never done it before. So you talk with customers. One customer told me they used to use 700 per day of a PPE item. Now they\u2019re going to use 40,000 per day, as an example.",
            "So given the awareness of the virus, we would expect elevated levels of pandemic product for the foreseeable future. Will it be as much as we\u2019ve had? Probably not, although as we see cases rise, my guess is there will be pretty significant elevated levels of pandemic product moving forward. But I do think this has forced people to change the way they think about personal protection and think about some of these products and keeping team members safe. So we expect to see elevated product levels for at least the next 1.5 years and probably beyond."

         "Speaker": "Ryan Merkel"

      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. First, and I can turn it over to Tom. Margins were not surprising for us there, and they performed, clearly, better than the pandemic sales, because a lot of the pandemic sales are very large orders to large contract customers. So the margins were certainly better with non-pandemic. I would say that it\u2019s challenging. Our market assumption of down 14, 15 in the U.S. would assume that non-pandemic sales were down quite a bit more than that. And so we do believe we gain significant share in non-pandemic product as well. Getting that level of detail, looking at that \u2013 our model is almost impossible to do. And so I would say, don\u2019t really know. We think we gained share throughout all product categories. Whether we gained more or less share with non-pandemic is really, really hard to do. My guess is it\u2019s less, but still very strong."

But in some respect, they\u2019re down 19% or whatever core. They held up the profits pretty well. How did they do that exactly? Like, why was there not more decremental drag? Is that just because it\u2019s been bad for so long that it\u2019s been able to sort of move and adjust the costs?

And coming off of the SAP installation and some other things, we had real challenging period there with service.",

And so we\u2019re seeing very strong growth with midsized customers in the last six weeks, which is encouraging.",

As was \u2013 I\u2019m not sure, but we get the daily sales monthly from their website. I mean, I think the factors are pretty clear. But is there any way to think about the SKU expansion year-over-year? And how much of that is contributing to the growth versus just demand? And I\u2019m curious, given the nature of the shutdowns and the pandemic, is there any cannibalization happening between single channel endless assortment and your traditional business during this period of time?"

If you look over the last three or four years, you look at curves of new product adds and their productivity, remains a big part of the growth of Zoro. And in, let\u2019s call it, normal times, we would expect product adds over the next three to five years to be as much as half of the growth of the business. And so that\u2019s obviously an important growth driver. We have not seen any further cannibalization during this period than we\u2019ve seen at other times between Zoro and Grainger.",
            "In fact, Zoro\u2019s growth has been \u2013 a lot of it\u2019s been very, very focused on very small customers during this time and getting them product they can\u2019t get elsewhere. So we\u2019re pretty excited about the pattern. I will say that both MonotaRO and Zoro have had higher acquisition than normal, and some of that acquisition has been consumers. We don\u2019t remarket to consumers. They do find as some \u2013 as people have been trying to find pandemic-related or really any product during this time. But the business acquisition has been stronger than normal, too, and that\u2019s really the important number to look at. So that\u2019s strong business acquisition, driven in part by product adds."

The 30 bps of headwind from price and customer mix, would you be prepared to talk about price in isolation? How is pricing tracking right now?

I will say our pricing, in normal years, we see GP trail off as the year goes along. This year is going to be not as much of that as we do see price get better, and we\u2019ve seen it get better through the second quarter.

Product mix had always been in volume. But just historically, it hadn\u2019t been so relevant. It was fairly static.

Tom, in the past, you\u2019ve mentioned that some introductory pricing was certainly an onboarding engine for large customer acquisition. I guess, is that still a part of the strategy? You highlighted some of the other pieces there, but should we still expect prices, from a strategic standpoint, to be a bit lower in that large customer piece of the business going forward?"

And maybe since you brought up gross margin related, let me try to unpack it even a little bit further than we did in the prepared remarks. As we\u2019re not giving guidance, want to be as helpful as we can to everybody putting their models together.",
            "So as we\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got 60%, which is COVID-related. So on 310 bps, that\u2019s roughly 180 bps unfavorable versus prior year. You\u2019ve got NSSM, it\u2019s 30 bps. So there, it\u2019s 210 in total. And the remainder is cost/other and as D.G. mentioned, historically, going from Q2 to Q3, we would see a meaningful decline in terms of gross margin rate. This year, going \u2013 as it relates to Q3, we expect that to be mitigated somewhat for the following reasons. NSSM will no longer be a headwind, so we will gain that back. We also see the tariff cadence improving. So tariff-related cost inflation will improve a little bit.",
            "And then we see price inflation strengthening as well, and we expect that to continue into Q3. Now the big wildcard, of course, is the pandemic impact as it relates to gross margin. So that is really the wildcard in terms of what the actual gross margin rate will be for Q3. What we do expect, though, as we compare the gross margin rate to the prior year, we don\u2019t expect to be down 310 bps in the U.S. segment and 290 bps overall. We do expect improvement from that. So just wanted to give you that color to help you all with your modeling. Thanks."

They have executed, I think, while the last year, to put themselves in a position where they can grow and improve profitability dramatically. So the pandemic doesn\u2019t change our thoughts on the business. We\u2019ve talked about sort of making sure we have a fast recovery of that business.

With respect to repurchasing shares, right now, with the spike and are we going to have a shutdown to with an abundance of caution, we really haven\u2019t resumed the buybacks, even though we are obviously generating robust cash flow. That, we would probably start to think a little bit harder at the end of Q3. And if we were going to do something, it would likely be in Q4, I would think."

So we do have to qualify suppliers. We have to decide whether or not the product meets our quality standards and actually does what it says it\u2019s going to do. And then we have to, in some cases, as Tom mentioned, yet you have to pay some upfront money, which typically would not happen, and we\u2019ve done that in a number of cases.",

And so we\u2019ve had to work with our team in China and to work with our team in the U.S. to really understand the quality, the availability, the integrity of the supply, and that\u2019s been really important. I think we\u2019ve done a nice job navigating that. But I expect that to weigh now in some categories that may remain. But generally, it\u2019s gotten a little bit easier lately."

The differences, if they exist, are relatively minor. We think that the Zoro business should be able to get to certainly high single-digit operating margins, which is very profitable from return on invested capital. And we\u2019ve got our plans to go ahead and make that happen over the next several years. And so we feel really good about the profitability path of Zoro."

We would also expect, as D.G. said, some of the money we paid to, let\u2019s say, air freight supply, we would expect that to likely go down as well. The bottom line is it\u2019s just so hard to predict something that\u2019s never happened before in terms of the pandemic.",

And what we see is we see a modest increase when we open the showrooms. It is \u2013 it should help margins because, typically, the profile of those customers are not generally contract customers, and it\u2019s usually higher-margin sales. So it will be modest for the overall growth profile, but it will help. And we\u2019ve seen that already happen as we\u2019ve opened those up."

So it\u2019s not thousands of suppliers before, but it\u2019s tens of suppliers. But we have a line of sight into getting to 6 million or 7million SKUs at this point, and we feel like getting to $10 million is not all that difficult to do given the new processes we have in place.",

Maybe I missed this earlier, but any framework around how to think about SG&A or incremental margins in the third quarter if sales continue to grow in that mid-single-digit range?"

And that is a decrease, obviously, from prior year, but an increase from Q2 as the country starts to open up and we\u2019re spending more on travel, we\u2019re spending more on advertising. Those types of things.",
            "As it relates to decremental margin, if we were to see a volume decline from 5% to 10%, which is inconsistent with what we\u2019ve seen so far, July to date, we would expect decremental margins to be in the 35% to 45% range, consistent with what we said last quarter. Obviously, if we continue at a mid-single-digit growth, then we would flip from decremental margins to incremental margins. And there, I think, depending on, again, and I have to keep \u2013 I apologize, I have to keep giving the qualifier of what the pandemic looks like. But depending on how the gross margin behaves, we could be around 20% plus/minus gross margins as long as the pandemic does not take a really harder hit on gross margin."
