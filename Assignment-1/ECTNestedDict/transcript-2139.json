         "Thanks Victor. As Victor mentioned in his opening remarks, our third quarter revenues were $13.5 million compared to $21.6 million in the year ago third quarter and reflects our pursuit of higher margin business. We reported gross profits of $4.2 million compared to last year's third quarter profit of $4.8 million, resulting in a gross profit of 31.2% compared to the year ago gross profit of $22.4 an improvement of 9%.",
         "Our engineering and development expenses for the third quarter was $693,000 compared to $583,000 in the year ago quarter. In the prior year quarter, we received a refund of $150,000 from a consulting cost for a project that wasn't completed. Our SG&A expenses in the quarter were $3.9 million slightly decreased from $4.1 million in last year's fiscal Q3 due to a decrease in variable compensation costs.",
         "We reported a loss before income of $200,000 in Q3 compared to income before income taxes of $206,000 in the prior-year third quarter. During the quarter, we had income tax expense of $10,000. The prior year quarter had a tax benefit of $326,000. In early April, when it became evident that the COVID-19 would have a severe economic impact, we took several actions to improve our cash flow, including the suspension of our quarterly dividend, stopped our stock buyback program and applied for and received a PPP loan.",
         "These actions at the end of June, strengthened our cash position by approximately $3 million. We ended the third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $20 million, which includes cash of $10 million in the UK and we have a pension liability of $5.2 million. Our actions are designed to ensure that we continue to drive our bottom line performance and boost sales of our higher-margin products.",
         "With that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

         "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the CSPi Fiscal 2020 Third Quarter Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this call is being recorded.",
         "And now, it is my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Sherk with EVC Group. Please go ahead, sir."

      "Victor Dellovo": [
         "Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and express our heartfelt concern to those who have been affected. Since we last talked with you in May, our team has continue to adjust how we operate the business to maximize our opportunities in a manner that is safe for both our employees and our customers. We've been able to maintain most of our workforce executing for our clients in more than 90% of the team is working remotely.",
         "We announced several months into the new normal and despite limiting our ability to visit our customers and potential customers, we continue to build a pipeline in all lines of our business. Total revenue for the fiscal third quarter was $13.5 million compared to $21.6 million we reported in the same period fiscal 2019. The year-over-year revenue decline was primarily related to COVID-19 pandemic, our decision to also transition our business to higher-margin products and services enabled us to significantly improve our gross margin. I believe this achievement demonstrates the soundness of our execution of our profitable growth plan.",
         "Further during this transition, our prospects remain quite high and if nothing else, the suddenness of the COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented of remote working of our clients, is helping to highlight network vulnerabilities. Businesses, both large and small remain exposed to increased threat and there have been several well-publicized ransomware attacks. I believe this fear in addition to providing a secure remote work -- working environment is a growing concern for many businesses. It is critical that the businesses have a partner that understands the complex challenges.",
         "We're positioning CSPI to be that partner as our newer solutions ARIA and our unified communication as a service or UCAS team ready-made for today's critical network issues. For the quarter, our technology solution or TS revenue was $11.9 million. While the TS division was impacted by COVID-19, we were able to generate most of our revenue from our large customers. Our managed service practice or MSP continues to perform well as we signed new customers during the quarter, which include cloud business and UCAS.",
         "Accordingly we have not lost a single customer as they value the service we are providing. This stickiness demonstrates our influence to our customers even during these unprecedented times. I believe that the three lines of recurring revenue business we created, continues to bring stability to CSPI. Separately, the cruise ship industry remains one of the most COVID-19 impacted industries. When we spoke in May, many operators were looking to resume cruise during the summer month.",
         "However in June the Cruise Line International Association or CLIA announced that the association oceangoing cruise line members will voluntary extend the suspension of the cruise operations from the US port until mid-September 2020. However, some cruise operators have a plan to restart in the EU ports in the coming weeks. While the continued travel restrictions hamper the ability to gain access to the ships, we continue to communicate with the operators every other week and we are prepared to move on a moment's notice.",
         "On the positive side, these upgrades need to occur and the operators have already purchased the equipment, so we would expect these ships to be prioritized when business resumes. As we have consistently reported over the past few quarters, our Microsoft practice continues to perform well and this latest quarter was no exception. We are in a month through Q4, so I am reaffirming our belief that we will achieve a greater growth rate for the business compared to a full-year growth rate of 140% we achieved in 2019.",
         "Regarding our UCAS offering an all-in-one service for hard and soft phones including 24x7 security and technical support with redundant data centers both in Florida and Texas, as a reminder UCAS market size is expected to grow from $15.8 billion in 2019 to $24.8 billion by 2024, being driven by growing trends towards mobility and bring your own device of BYOD to the workplace.",
         "During the quarter, we continue to have success as we added new customers and expanded sites at our current customers, all while continue to increase the number of virtual product demonstrations we are performing on a weekly basis, the new business pipeline is promising and the team is engagement with prospects and is maintaining constant communication.",
         "Now I will move to our High Performance Products or HPP division. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 million in line with our estimate and reflects revenue from our legacy business being offset by the expected decline in Myricom business. ARIA our award-winning next generation cybersecurity platform, the health organization protect themselves from heartful in attacks without human intervention is continuing to garner tremendous interest in customer success as we recently completed installation for international customer.",
         "Further we continue to be well positioned within a leading cable company and other OEMs opportunities for ARIA. I believe the testimony along with the industry acknowledgement and robust lead flow we are generating from virtual tradeshows will drive future sales in the HPP division. Additionally, we now have six partners for our official general program and we are speaking with several others to ensure a robust program.",
         "To summarize, the CSPI team is performing well and remain focused during the unprecedented times. We have made and will continue to make necessary adjustments to our operations to ensure business execution. Specifically, our new ARIA and UCAS offerings are generating the expected interest as we sign up new customers and broadening our pipeline. We have a diverse customer base both large and small and this quest will allow us to successfully navigate the near-term uncertainty. We are excited about our long-term growth prospects.",
         "With that, I will now ask Gary to provide a brief overview on the fiscal third quarter financial performance."

Okay on the UCAS offering I see we've signed a couple customers with UPS, have we -- are most of the customers that we're getting here, I think taken the standard price or we do modifications like you had indicated some conference call ago?

If it's just a ring tone, it's probably not our bag, they're not customers that we were really interested in. If they try and do like $4 a month or something very, very inexpensive per user, that's not where we're trying to go after."

I represent an individual and a group, which is I believe a largest shareholder in the company, and we're extremely bullish about what you're doing. The technology is there, the innovation is there, the management is there. And the story is, and we believe the valuation to be really compelling especially when compared to so many names in your group.",

This is a growth company in the cybersecurity space that is trading at a massive discount in my opinion."

We're also continuing to at least trying to put the word out about the product itself, we're still competing in certain issues so that we get notified, I mean, noticed by different people in the media, and trying to get more there as well as we're being very proactive on the channel to get people there from the customer standpoint, but we really have to look at getting our message out more and more. We think you're correct in that and I know Victor is trying to get more things going on the IR front."

But if you really look at the technology, they do piece points where we feel that we're covering 70% to 80% of the overall security, we can cover with both the ARIA products that that we currently have.",
            "So I definitely think we're on the value, we need a few more customers to build up a little bit more of a reputation that you could go to some of the players that covered garden, the foresters and try to get them to cover it, but I put that product against any of the other products that are out there that you see on National TVs commercials and stuff like that, that are out there. But they've been doing it a little bit longer and definitely a lot bigger at this stage. But compared -- product wise, I definitely put us against the product any day."

Can you briefly speak to a couple of the companies that you're working with that you hope to work with that are among the well known, most well known in their spaces?"

I think even in this pandemic type of environment, they do have money that they have to spend in security, to protect whether it\u2019s clients information both on the financial or on the HIPAA and in healthcare. So those are two verticals that we've concentrated on. And we're talking to like I said the largest cable companies that are out there, also that we're talking to right now.",

So whether it's even ARIA can be as a recurring revenue model on a monthly basis, you have the UCAS on a recurring revenue model basis, usually the three-year contracts, and then so between UCAS potentially ARIA can be so just bought or month recurring revenue. And then you have the MSP, the managed service practice, which are all recurring revenue models. So we would recognize revenue as over the period of three years."

We didn't and certain months were stronger than other, but the trends were that the customers were purchasing. So at some times with a buying product, you're getting the whole product more, but the reoccurring revenue was the ones that we're getting the new stuff and that was sort of spread throughout the quarter that different things came on board."

So you are going to see huge swings. Every month you're hoping you just keep increasing it, but then there has been a lot some large purchases, some of our financial institutions that towards throughout the whole quarter spend millions of dollars at a time.",

So you bring that back down to 40% or 60% or however we want to do and that's how we manage it and then we have sales meetings and reviews with the salespeople every week and they go over their pipeline and net new opportunities and then we have other meetings where we have our project managers on the phone with the lead and head of engineering and we go through all the business that's either new SOWs that went out the door to customers or current SOWs that are already been signed in rollouts and where we are in the project and when we expect to close them.
