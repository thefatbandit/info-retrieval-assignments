         "Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong second quarter financial results during a period of extreme uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. As reported last time, the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and measures taken to control the spread of the virus had a significant impact on the economy, on retailers and our consumers. The month of April was particularly challenging for every business, including Garmin. However, conditions steadily improved, and we ended the quarter with significant growth momentum.",
         "Consolidated revenue came in at $870 million, down only 9% on a year-over-year basis. We experienced strong growth from certain online channels, including garmin.com, which partially offset weakness from retailers who were disrupted during the early phases of the pandemic. We also delivered strong profitability. Gross margin was 59.3%. Operating margin was 21.7%, with operating income of $188 million for the quarter. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.96 and pro forma EPS of $0.91 for the quarter. Doug will provide additional financial details in a moment, but first, I\u2019d like to make a few remarks on the performance of our business segments.",
         "Starting with the fitness segment, revenue increased 17%, driven by strong consumer interest in health and fitness. Sales of advanced wearables and cycling products were very strong in the quarter. Gross and operating margins were 53% and 24%, respectively. We recently acquired Firstbeat Analytics, our long time partner and leading provider of physiological analytics technology for health, fitness and athletic performance. This acquisition will help us achieve even greater levels of innovation that will benefit consumers. Looking forward, we expect that the interest in health and fitness will remain very strong. We are ready to seize this opportunity with a great lineup of new products with more new products on the way.",
         "Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 4% as boating and fishing became popular pastimes during the pandemic. Many boat builders were idle during the quarter, which tempered our growth, but retail sales were very strong, led by chartplotters and Panoptix sonars. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 28%, respectively. During the quarter, we launched quatix solar, our first marine smartwatch featuring solar charging technology. Looking forward, interest in our marine products remains very strong. We anticipate an extended marine season this year as boaters maximize their time on the water and boat builders work through production backlogs. Additionally, we intend to leverage our compelling product lineup to capture additional market share.",
         "Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue decreased 2%. Weakness in traditional handheld categories was mostly offset by growth in adventure watches. Gross margin and operating margin were 65% and 33%, respectively. We recently incorporated solar charging technology into the fenix 6, the 6S, the Instinct line and tactix Delta smartwatches. The Instinct Solar sets a new standard in low power technology by achieving unlimited smartwatch operation using only the energy harvested from the sun. We expect that our solar harvesting technology will be a significant differentiator for us in the smartwatch market. Interest in adventure and outdoor activity remains very strong. We are ready to seize this opportunity with a great lineup of recently introduced products with more new products and new categories on the way.",
         "Turning next to the aviation segment. Revenue decreased 31% as the pandemic created economic uncertainty that negatively impacted OEM partners and retrofit activity. In addition, sales of ADS-B products rapidly declined, as we expected, after the U.S. mandate passed and the market matured. Gross and operating margins were 73% and 12%, respectively. During the quarter, Autoland was certified, marking the beginning of a new era for general aviation safety technology. Autoland is already available and flying on the Piper M600 and Daher TBM 940, and additional certifications are on the way.",
         "For the remainder of the year, we anticipate aviation will continue to face challenging headwinds. However, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for this segment as interest in general aviation remains high and we are prepared with a strong lineup of products for every aircraft application. In addition, we believe that advanced safety technologies such as Autoland will make general aviation accessible to more people, which in turn is expected to grow the market.",
         "Finally, for the auto segment, revenue decreased 46% as automakers idled their factories and driving activity decreased significantly. Gross margin was 47%, with an operating loss of $10 million in the quarter, driven by the investment we are making to complete several significant programs. Specialty RV and truck categories were a bright spot during the quarter. We launched several products, including new diesel navigators with oversized displays and enhanced routing features and our new RV 890 navigator designed specifically for the needs of the RV and camping lifestyle. Looking forward, we anticipate that revenue from OEM products will grow in the back half of the year as we complete several OEM programs. Additionally, we continue to invest in specialty products and expect to enter new market verticals soon.",
         "And finally, most of you are aware of the recent cyber attack that led to a network outage affecting much of our website and consumer-facing applications. We immediately assessed the nature of the attack and started remediation efforts. We have no indication that any customer data was accessed, lost or stolen. Additionally, the functionality of Garmin products was not affected other than the ability to access some online services. Critical affected business systems have been restored, and we expect to restore remaining systems in the coming days. We appreciate the patience and kind words of support we\u2019ve received from customers and friends during this challenge.",
         "So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on financial results. Doug?"
      ],
      "Doug Boessen": [
         "Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $870 million for the second quarter, representing a 9% decrease year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.3%, 100 basis point decrease in the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 37.6%, a 220 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $188 million, a 26% decrease year-over-year. Operating margin was 21.7%, a 510 basis point decrease from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.96, pro forma EPS was $0.91.",
         "Next, we look at our second quarter revenue by segment. We achieved revenue of $870 million with two of our five segments posting growth, led by the fitness segment with strong revenue growth of 17%. As seen in the charts, we have a diversified business model from both a segment and geography perspective.",
         "Looking at our year-to-date revenue for the first six months of 2020. Our consolidated revenue was flat to the prior year, with three of our segments posting growth, led by fitness with 20% growth; marine, with 12% growth. Our geography, EMEA is up 6%; Americas is flat compared to the prior year.",
         "Looking next, operating expenses. Our second quarter operating expenses increased by $8 million or 2%. Research and development increased $17 million year-over-year, primarily due to investments in engineering resources. Advertising expenses decreased approximately $12 million from the prior year quarter due to lower media spend. SG&A increased $3 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses.",
         "A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $524 million, but decreased year-over-year in line with second quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential year-over-year basis due to our strategy to increase data supply, sport increasingly diversified product lines, timing of product launches, the transition to a higher percentage of ocean shipments compared to air. In the second quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $142 million, $50 million increase from the prior quarter.",
         "In the second quarter 2020, we report an effective tax rate of 6.8%. Excluding the impact of a $14 million income tax benefit due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves associated with the 2014 intercompany restructuring, our pro forma effective tax rate was 14% compared to 18.9% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to intellectual property migration transaction.",
         "This concludes our formal remarks. May, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

            "Hi. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. So just on aviation. You mentioned a long recovery here, and you do have tough comps on ADS-B to end the year. But do you think we\u2019ve kind of troughed in 2Q in your view? And are you seeing any kind of uptick in demand in July? And then on the margins, it looks like your gross margins are pretty steady from the last quarter. What can you do kind of on the OpEx side in the near term to kind of shore up profitability there? And any onetime items kind of hitting aviation or mostly just lower revenue impact?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Good morning, Paul. Definitely, we\u2019ve seen improvements in the sales across all the segments from April, including aviation. As I mentioned, it does take a little more time for that market to recover, but we\u2019re very optimistic about the future there. And definitely, those trends, I think, are continuing as we move into July, and we expect it to do so throughout the end of the year. In terms of margins, particularly the operating margin side of things, we do have \u2013 because of the lower volumes, we do have some additional overhead expenses that are being absorbed in the business. But as trends continue to improve over time, we would expect those to wash out."

         "Remarks": [

But what we see is that Autoland is a unique technology, differentiating for us that helps our systems stand out compared to others in the market. And so consequently, we see it as a significant differentiator for our entire cockpit system line."

So the results that we talked about, the increased interest in cycling is definitely Tacx is a part of that as well as our cycling head units. There was a lot of interest in these products and continues to be with a lot of people focusing on indoor activities, and the backlogs are very strong. So we\u2019re working to catch up with demand."

Cliff, can you talk about the sustainability of \u2013 especially on the consumer-facing markets, the fitness, the outdoors and maybe a little bit in the marine? Obviously, I think a lot of investors have expected the stimulus in North America and in part of Europe has drove a lot of money in the pockets of the consumers and that has helped spending in discretionary items. But how do you see that demand sustaining into the second half? And any kind of color you can give us on how you\u2019re thinking about the September quarter directionally? I know you\u2019re not guiding, but typically, seasonally has been down. Now obviously, it\u2019s a much more unique situation. So how are you thinking of sequential performance in the September quarter overall? That will be helpful."

         "Speaker": "Nik Todorov"
      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So the stimulus, I suppose, when people have more money, they do spend it, which is the intent of the program. I would say, though, that as we look forward, and there\u2019s uncertainty around what stimulus or how much it would be, we still see a lot of interest from retailers and excitement around things coming up in the second half. So we believe that with their indications, plus what we\u2019re hearing back from consumers that the product categories that we\u2019re in are the ones where people will spend their money. In terms of September, we don\u2019t comment in terms of forward guidance. As I mentioned in my remarks, we did exit the quarter with strong momentum, and we\u2019re continuing to experience that. And so we\u2019re focusing on making sure that we can fill all of demand for the quarter and also for the back half of the year."

      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And on the fitness gross margin, very strong given, I believe, you had a little bit more \u2013 you were a little bit more aggressive on the discounting to drive consumer demand, which actually paid-off. But when you talked about strength in cycling, are you guys seeing also, in addition to Tacx, maybe a little bit more contribution from your traditional cycling outdoor products, and that is a strong contributor to that gross margin, essentially staying flat year-over-year? Is that a right way to think about it?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, there\u2019s always product mix that comes into the overall gross margin for a segment. We definitely saw increased sales of Tacx, which we\u2019ve remarked in the past is at about at category average or slightly below. And then we also saw strong sales of other products, which are category average or above. So in general, it \u2013 the extra products and Tacx certainly didn\u2019t hurt us. And the promotional activities were targeted and the mix of sales between retailers and online was such that we came out very well in the quarter."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So as it relates to free cash flow in Q2, we saw there is some year-over-year improvement in some working capital items there. So as we saw the receivables receipts were higher year-over-year just due to the lower demand that we had in Q2 being lower from that standpoint. At this point in time, we\u2019re not providing any forward-looking guidance for free cash flow. And at this point in time, we do not have plans for any stock buyback."

I know you have a lot of opportunities there or on the PND side. Any kind of \u2013 what makes you most excited? I know you\u2019re generally not commenting on any future products, but any kind of hints will be helpful."

Cliff, you mentioned in the marine segment, the boat builders were idle and maybe constrained some supply or demand in the quarter. Could you address what you\u2019re seeing there? And then also in the broader wearables and any other categories where you\u2019re seeing maybe an imbalance in channel inventory out there."

      "23": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So I would say, in general, at the channel level, we think things are in balance or even possibly lean at this point. We watch very closely the real-time pull-through of our products through registrations that we have. And so consequently, we can definitely see the trends in the retail side of things and compare that to what we see in the channel and what we\u2019re shipping into the channel. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of strength on the consumer side of things. It\u2019s definitely not backing up in the channel. And then if anything, it\u2019s a little lean. From the boat builder side, they\u2019re not necessarily a source of inventory. They take products as they need them. But on the retail side of marine, sales have been very strong, and we\u2019ve been working hard with our retail partners on the marine side to keep up with the demand."

And then you\u2019ve talked a little bit about this BMW Tier 1 facility. Where are you on the ramp in these facilities? Any thoughts on the timing and the capital outlay associated with those through the course of this year into next year?"

            "Yes. So basically, I would say that, first, both of those facilities you mentioned, the Tacx manufacturing facility that we have in Europe as well as the OEM manufacturing facility in Europe, both of those are on plan. So we both \u2013 we expect both of those to be up and running here later in the year. And actually, things are going well from those, and those will be basically \u2013 especially from the Tacx standpoint, that really helped us out because of the increased demand we\u2019re seeing on our Tacx products to meet some of that demand. At this point in time, I\u2019m not providing any full forward-looking guidance on any CapEx."

The mix of maybe at your facilities versus at their homes? How that\u2019s coming back online? And then any influence that\u2019s had on OpEx to date, maybe lower OpEx levels with less people, less travel, things like that? And then any thoughts on how permanent this might be looking forward?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So we have been very careful as we\u2019ve gone through this process to try to maintain a very safe workplace. At the beginning, we had most of our people at home. Of course, as a production and distribution business, there are certain people that always have to be here. But for the most part, they were at home. We\u2019ve since transitioned to about one-third of our associates being on site, and we\u2019ve implemented protocols as we work here in our buildings across the world really for keeping safety. We\u2019re anticipating that this is a long-term deal. We\u2019re not rushing to get people back. But at the same time, we\u2019re also trying to focus on rotating people in and out of the facility to get them with their teammates to be able to interact and enjoy the dynamic environment that we have here at Garmin.",
            "In terms of OpEx impact, it\u2019s difficult to quantify, but I would say there\u2019s increased pressure for expenses, of course, as we provided more benefits for our associates to be able to manage some of the difficulties they\u2019ve had in their personal life with schools and family members and also concerns for their own health. But in general, we feel like that\u2019s manageable, and we\u2019re happy and we\u2019re very pleased actually with how we\u2019ve been able to work through this crisis so far."

As we move almost into August here from July, I mean, any reason to think that the trends you\u2019ve seen in fitness, outdoor, marine shouldn\u2019t continue through Q3? I mean it sounds like you exited on a really strong note, and I assume that\u2019s continuing. Just want to kind of confirm that first."

As I said in my remarks, we definitely see continued opportunity through the year in those categories, particularly as people are very interested in health, wellness, fitness and outdoor activity and adventure. So those are very strong products, the fenix Solar, Instinct Solar is resonating very well. And of course, I think consumers are excited about what will happen in the back half as retailers start to get back to normal in terms of promotions and holidays."

I mean anything you can call out on the supply chain front in terms of constraints or concerns in terms of components for products? And then the second piece is, as you look at the fitness category, in particular, I know a lot of retailers have struggled to keep as many bicycles in as they liked. There\u2019s been, as we know, strong retail demand on that front. Has that extended to your products? Are there any issues with respect to having enough inventory on hand for retailers on the cycling front?"

            "Yes. So supply chain wise, I think the \u2013 early in the pandemic, the focus was on supply chain continuity and maintaining the flow of components we needed for our business. As the pandemic evolved, of course, then everyone worried about the economic downturn. As things have come back, if anything, where we had challenges in supply chain is keeping up with the demand. And that\u2019s part of what we\u2019ve mentioned in terms of gross margin. The freight costs were higher as we work to get products in place for retailers and opportunities that needed them. Specifically around cycling, definitely that has been an area of constraint when it comes to product availability, especially in Tacx products. Again, we have a strong backlog of those. And also with cycling computers and those kinds of products, we are spending more on air freight as we try to get those into place at retailers. Cycling activities have been very popular with customers. "

And that\u2019s a region that, I guess, returning \u2013 I guess, should be returning to normal more quickly or should happen in Q2. Just to be interested in the color there, what\u2019s the mix difference maybe that\u2019s driving the relatively weaker performance in Asia Pac versus the other areas?"

I think the pandemic and the concern over the pandemic was much stronger there than in some of the other regions, especially at first. And so they\u2019ve taken longer to come back. Each country has its own story. But of course, China has been a significant factor, as well as larger countries like Thailand as well. So APAC kind of is a different narrative from the other geographies. In Americas, I would say that aviation impacted us more there than the consumer side of things. So Americas\u2019 performance, I feel, was very good. And a similar story, in Europe, although aviation\u2019s impact is lower there, but still was an impact. But in general, when you exclude that, I\u2019m very pleased with the performance of those geographies."

I wonder maybe you could just update us on your long-term thoughts on aviation.

We see some of the partners in the charter side of things see a significant uptick in the number of people who are inquiring about and proceeding with charter flights over the concern over exposure on airlines. And I think general aviation definitely has a slower timetable when it comes to reacting to these kinds of demand changes. It\u2019s still a very small market. But for sure, we\u2019re seeing anecdotal evidence of customers being more interested in investing in aircraft and in equipment."

I wonder if you think that\u2019s a permanent change or shift in the trajectory of direct-to-consumer as a proportion of your business? Or that was more temporary because of some demand that retailers couldn\u2019t fill? And then I\u2019m also curious about advertising spending. It was down a decent amount from a year ago, and you also got some leverage there. I wonder if there\u2019s a permanent change in maybe needing less advertising? Or that was just a function of sort of some of the things that were happening in the quarter?"

And again, we have a mix of all kinds of retail and product outlet situation. So we work with all of them, but we definitely see that customers are gravitating towards online purchases, whether it\u2019s through a partner or through Garmin. And we did see a significant uptick, as we mentioned in our own web sales, which we view as a positive development. In terms of advertising and what the dynamics are there, there are really two things. There was certainly impact because of the pandemic and everyone just pulling back because for a while, everyone was glued to news channels and websites, staying indoors and not doing much. But as things evolve, that quickly changed. And so we became very strategic in how we spent our advertising money, focusing on digital and social channels as well as co-op opportunities with retailers. I would see that continuing as well as we go forward, as the situation remains very dynamic and retailers\u2019 plans also are very dynamic."

So I think it\u2019s very specific there. Of course, there\u2019s fundamental control technologies that are probably extensible to other areas. But specifically for auto, that problem is much different to solve, and I wouldn\u2019t see a lot of overlap there.

I\u2019m just curious, from a high level, we know that in 2008, 2009, aviation was fairly weak. Would just love to hear what you think about aviation today during the current crisis relative to that time? And any differences you see that you can compare and contrast?

But I think that\u2019s probably where the similarity ends. Back in 2008 and 2009, there was a significant oversupply of every kind of business jet. And so as the financial crisis developed and companies were pulling back, individuals we\u2019re pulling back, there\u2019s a lot of used aircraft on the market, which impacted valuations. And even to this day, there\u2019s probably still impact from that more than 10 years on. And I would say that this time, though, one of the positive things that we see is that activity in the light jet side of things, probably light and up to light medium jet is still very strong. And as I mentioned in the earlier question that interest around charter and ownership in those class of aircraft is remaining firm. So we\u2019re excited about that. And we think even in the small aircraft side of things, there\u2019s more potential as people consider traveling by private aircraft as opposed to commercial aircraft.",
            "And then on your question with ADS-B, what inning are we in? We \u2013 actually we\u2019re in the extra innings. So we felt like ADS-B performed in terms of overall market adaptation, much better than anyone predicted at the very beginning stages. And as we go forward, it doesn\u2019t mean that we sell zero ADS-B products. We\u2019ll continue to sell ADS-B products to new aircraft. Of course, they all need that. And also as in the aftermarket, we expect that competitive systems will be upgraded. That\u2019s a market opportunity for us to take share. And of course, products, repairs and things that happen that require new systems. So it will be just an ongoing business going forward."
