      "Matt Kay": [
         "Thank you. Hello, and welcome to the FY '20 full year results presentation for Beach Energy. My name is Matt Kay. I'm the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Beach. Joining me on the call today is Morn\u00e9 Engelbrecht, our Chief Financial Officer. We're also joined by a number of Beach executives who are available to answer questions later. The format today is we'll run through the results presentation and the revised 5-year outlook before opening the lines for Q&A.",
         "Let's move straight into the presentation. Slide 2 presents our disclaimer and includes oil price and ForEx assumptions used in our 5-year outlook and FY '21 guidance as well as reserves disclosure. I'll let you have a read of that at your leisure.",
         "Before we move on to the main presentation, I wanted to point out Slide 3 highlights an important decision we reached in FY '20. During the financial year, Beach rewrote its purpose statement to more accurately reflect what we strive to do each day. This resulted in the rollout of our updated business purpose: the sustainability -- sustainably deliver energy for communities. This updated purpose highlights we are making a positive contribution to the communities in which we operate that have great importance to everyone at Beach, take pride in being an active and leading member in our communities while delivering the critical energy and society needs.",
         "Moving to Slide 4. To say that FY '20 was a tale of 2 halves would be an understatement. The first half of FY '20, Beach was tracking extremely well, its most ambitious and exciting year of organic growth in the company's history. At the half year mark, we have drilled 105 wells with an 83% success rate. That included exploration success at Beharra Springs Deep-1 in the Perth Basin, a positive appraisal drilling at Bauer in the Cooper Basin, which identified a field extension. We spudded Black Watch-1, which has subsequently been connected to the Otway Gas Plant, delivering its first new gas supply in more than 4 years. And importantly, we are on track to deliver full year production and EBITDA within the guidance range.",
         "And of course, during February and March, the full impact of COVID-19 began to hit the global economy, and of course, Beach is not immune. From a demand perspective, there was a significant reduction in global oil and LNG demand as behavior has changed rapidly to combat the spread of the virus. You will recall the Brent oil price fell to USD 18 a barrel during March. Furthermore, there were significant supply chain disruptions from global sources, creating issues in obtaining timely components for major equipment.",
         "Additionally, travel restrictions resulting from COVID-19 have added challenges from a workforce perspective as flying in and out of interstate and overseas locations became problematic. Fortunately for Beach, the combination of a strong underlying business and swift response to COVID-19 put the company in an extremely robust position to combat the challenges presented for the second half of FY '20. As at 30 June 2020, Beach's balance sheet sits in a position of strength, $50 million net cash and $500 million of liquidity.",
         "The swift market downturn has also highlighted the strength of our assets. Despite the challenging environment, Beach still delivered high returns with return on capital employed of 19% in FY '20. Further evidence of this is the fact there were no material impairments across our portfolio, and our reserves remain robust at even lower commodity prices. It's important to again point out to the revenue certainty provided by our gas business, which exceeds total operating expenditure and our stay-in-business capital expenditure.",
         "Despite the relative strength of our business, Beach took a prudent approach to costs in response to the swift market decline and COVID challenges. In the second half of FY '20, Beach made targeted staff and contractor reductions, renegotiated most supply contracts and ensured FY '20 field operating expenditure per barrel to 3% lower than FY '19. As you're aware, we also reduced planned FY '21 capital expenditure by more than 30%.",
         "Go to Slide 5. I won't dwell too much on this slide. Our response to the pandemic was swift and decisive. I'm extremely proud of the manner in which everyone at Beach responded. We enacted our crisis management team in February and have had and will continue to have a dedicated team focused on our business continuity plans. As a result, we're extremely confident in our ability to work with governments, regulators and our communities to ensure we can deliver the work program in FY '21.",
         "Slide 6 helps summarize where Beach currently stands in light of what has transpired over the last 12 months. Despite the global shock waves, Beach drilled 178 wells at an 81% overall success rate. Beach recorded production of 26.7 million barrels of oil equivalent in FY '20. That's about 2% higher than pro forma FY '19 production and was within 1% of guidance.",
         "Our EBITDA of $1.108 billion was within 6% of guidance despite the material decline in oil prices in the second half. As a result, our underlying NPAT was $461 million FY '20. Our final dividend of $0.01 per share is unchanged on the prior period as we continue to prioritize total shareholder returns through value-accretive investments.",
         "We now enter FY '21 in an extremely strong position to pursue value-accretive growth, albeit at a more measured pace in response to the current economic climate. We believe the greater than 30% reduction in capital expenditure in FY '21 is also prudent management of investment activity given the risks and uncertainty created by COVID-19. Despite this reduction in investment expenditure, there is still plenty of exciting activity to look forward to in FY '21.",
         "The offshore Otway campaign will now commence drilling between December 2020 and March 2021 following the signing of a new rig contract with Diamond Offshore for the Ocean Onyx.",
         "Now West, we and our operator Mitsui have made great progress with Waitsia Stage 2 final investment decision, which is expected in coming months based on exporting up to 1.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG by the North West Shelf infrastructure. More on that later.",
         "Additionally, the significant Ironbark 1 exploration well in the Carnarvon Basin is expected to spud with operator BP in Q2 of FY '21. As you can see, these investments make absolute sense with Beach's ability to invest through the cycle. I'll provide more detail later during the presentation. And we forecast to generate $2.1 billion of free cash flow over the next 5 years even with a reduced commodity price outlook.",
         "The stress test forecast peak net gearing to less than 10% even at USD 30 a barrel oil price over the next 5 years. Because of these world-class financial metrics, we have the full confidence in continuing our growth trajectory.",
         "Slide 7 provides an important insight into the Beach journey since FY '19. Given all that has occurred over the past 6 months, it's easy to forget where this journey started along the Lattice acquisition and how well Beach has performed over the past 2 years. As you can see via the table, Beach has met its stated cumulative FY '19 and FY '20 objectives across production and CapEx. In addition to this, we've exceeded expectations when it comes to free cash flow generation, reserves replacement and return on capital employed.",
         "Moving to Slide 8, a slide that we're extremely proud of as it again displayed our ability to achieve over 200% organic 2P reserves replacement for the third year running. In fact, we actually beat our FY '19 results in FY '20, achieving a 2P reserves replacement of 214%. This in turn led to an increase in 2P reserves life from 12.4 years to 13.2 years. As I mentioned earlier, we've taken no material impairments across producing assets. As mentioned in the slide, given a further 20% reduction in oil and gas prices, we only reduced our 2P reserves by less than 3%. That's a robust set of assets.",
         "Slide 9 outlines our safety performance. Despite this being slightly further down the pack than previous years, I can assure you safety remains the highest priority of Beach. From a safety perspective, our total recordable injury frequency rate or TRIFR remained below 4 for the third year in a row. Given COVID distractions, that's a solid result. Our environmental performance and process safety performance were both strong, maintaining the improvement levels that we've achieved over the past 4 years.",
         "Turning to Slide 10 and before I hand over to Morn\u00e9, I wanted to take a moment to mention Beach's commitment to sustainability. For the past 2 years, Beach has had an emphasis on improving our focus, disclosure and capability in the sustainability space, in particular around emissions reductions. Beach is committed to playing a key role in a lower carbon future. And over the past year, we've conducted emissions benchmarking at all of our sites. This benchmarking fed into a body of work, which ultimately led to the Board committing to an emissions reduction target of 25% CO2 equivalent by FY '25 relative to FY '18 benchmark levels. Those benchmark levels were set based on the timing of the acquisition of the Lattice assets. We look forward to investigating and implementing projects in the coming years to help Beach achieve these ambitions. You will note we've also disclosed our carbon price assumptions we apply to regularly test our portfolio.",
         "I'd now like to hand over to Morn\u00e9 to run you through our financial results in more detail. Morn\u00e9?",
         "Thank you, Morn\u00e9. If we move to Slide '18, you can see Beach is well placed at 3 gas markets we service: the Australian East Coast and West Coast gas markets and the New Zealand domestic market. While a large amount of our focus remains on the East Coast gas market in Australia, we believe all 3 markets represent attractive value to our portfolio. Note that we maintain a relatively even split in gas and liquids production across the portfolio, of course, with the benefit of a diversified spread of 6 production hubs.",
         "On Slide 19, you can see AEMO information released earlier this year. It shows the forecast Eastern Australian gas supply versus demand. Despite the short-term impacts of COVID-19, the fundamental story remains the same: Southeastern Australia is not producing enough gas to meet its own demand. As such, states of South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria are reliant on gas diverted from LNG projects in Queensland to meet demand. Going forward, the picture doesn't get much better. This reliance on LNG diversions is set to increase over time unless there is a significant increase in supply. We at Beach recognize the challenge, and our investment thesis to support East Coast gas supply remains, albeit at a more conservative pace.",
         "Slide 20. While we've seen declines in regional spot LNG prices and therefore in spot pipeline gas prices, especially in Queensland, Slide 20 helps reinforce the point of Beach's minimal exposure at lower spot prices. Indeed, in FY '21 to FY '22, only about 2% of our East Coast gas sales are exposed to spot pricing. They remain under long-term contracts.",
         "As I move to Slide 21, I wish to highlight that in the interest of time, we'll only dive into the Victorian Otway, Cooper Basin and Perth Basin assets. There's a bunch of information in here we provide for your benefit when you have the time. Detailed information about the other assets can be found in the appendices, and we're more than willing to answer any questions you may have.",
         "Moving to Slide 22, we turn our focus especially to the West. FY '20 was a very successful year in the Perth Basin, and we are confident we can carry this momentum over into FY '21. On the exploration front, Beach had success at the Beharra Springs Deep exploration well with flow rates comparable to that at Waitsia. We also completed the acquisition of the Trieste 3D seismic survey, which confirmed multi-TCF exploration potential in EP 320.",
         "Beach also moved to Waitsia Stage 1. With final investment decision and execution, I can advise that we introduced first gas into this facility in the past few days.",
         "Move to Slide 23, which I guess you could call our big reveal of the day: Waitsia Stage 2. We're on the cusp of taking final investment decision development of about half of Waitsia gas to LNG via the North West Shelf facilities. It's required a lot of work over the past 2 years with our operator Mitsui. And we are providing as much detail as we reasonably can today on final agreements, and approvals are well in progress.",
         "Now what's been happening on North West Shelf, we've now signed a detailed nonbinding gas processing term sheet for the North West Shelf venture. That means that key terms are done. We are now progressing gas processing and gas time agreements. We expect to begin exporting LNG via the North West Shelf by late 2023. We'll be marketing our own offtake, and we've had an experienced and senior LNG marketing team in place at Beach for more than a year.",
         "Two, gas pipeline access. If you haven't noticed, this year with Stage 1 expansion of Waitsia, joint venture has already created a 280 terajoule a day connection to the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline. We're well advanced in technical and commercial discussions with AGIG on transportation arrangements through the North West Shelf.",
         "Three, WA government and regulators. I'm very pleased to say that the Waitsia joint venture and indeed our Beharra Springs joint venture will be providing about 40 terajoules a day of domestic gas into WA this year. We also intend to expand that domestic gas supply. And that is helped by the Western Australian government supporting Waitsia exporting up to 50% of its reserves at LNG through the North West Shelf. The Waitsia Stage 2 development will be a significant contributor to the Western Australian economy. I can also advise that we're well advanced in submissions and the approval processes with regulators, including the EPA.",
         "Four, construction agreement. We're now at the final bid stage of what has been a multiple-stage process: the engineering, procurement and commissioning of our 250 terajoule a day gas processing facility at Waitsia. That provides enough feed gas to allow us to produce in the order of 1.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG at North West Shelf. As you can see, Beach and our operator Mitsui have been very busy at Waitsia, and all the jigsaw pieces are now coming together. We're in excellent shape to reach final investment decision in the next couple of months.",
         "Now you want to know a lot more detail about this. But given the confidentiality obligations, these various arrangements and many stakeholders, I can't share much more with you today.",
         "Go to Slide 24. Move back to Eastern Australia. You can see our offshore Otway drilling program is back on track with the execution of a new rig contract with Diamond Offshore on the Ocean Onyx. The agreement provides for the drilling of up to 9 wells with drilling operations expected to commence in December 2020 and March 2021. The agreement, which is at globally competitive rig rates for deepwater semi-sub rigs, includes provisions for COVID-19-related costs and delays. This agreement means Beach can move forward with our plans to develop more natural gas supplies in the East Coast gas market. You should be aware, Beach successfully drilled the onshore-to-offshore Black Watch 1 extended reach well, which is now producing into the Otway Gas Plant. We expect to spud the onshore-to-offshore Enterprise 1 exploration well towards the end of September.",
         "Slide 25 provides some additional context around the delay of the Otway drilling program and COVID-related challenges faced by the broader Otway development project. The supply chain for this project extends across multiple countries. Travel restrictions had an adverse impact on logistics and the supply chain, most notably around Christmas trees and subsea control modules. This challenge was mitigated by shifting the final stage of construction from Batam, Indonesia to Perth.",
         "The recent months, our contracts and procurement team has worked diligently with suppliers to mitigate additional issues and ensure supplies and services are ready for commencement of the offshore program. Importantly, delays have only reduced the present value of the Otway program at well below 5%.",
         "Go to Slide 26. We're moving back to South Australia and turning our attention to Western Flank. And wow, what a story it continues to be with more great results in FY '20. Operated production surpassed 23,000 barrels per day in the second half of FY '20, and drilling success stirred a 159% 2P reserves replacement ratio. Western Flank continues to be a high-returning asset with most development wells having IRRs of greater than 100%. However, given the commodity price environment, FY '21 capital expenditure will be reduced by 50% to $110 million, and we're going into a partial harvest mode. Our aim is to maintain output above 20,000 barrels per day as we seek to high-grade our prospect and lead portfolio for drilling program in FY '22.",
         "On this point, it should be noted that at least 4 oil fields have yet to be fully appraised. And we have 7 drilled and uncompleted wells waiting in the Western Flank oil portfolio.",
         "Slide 27. I won't spend too much time on this slide. I think it speaks for itself. Expected ultimate recovery of oil in our Western Flank acreage has more than doubled in the past 4 years. And as most of you know, we've doubled production in the last 2 years. 2P expected ultimate recovery is now approaching 100 million barrels net to Beach, a truly outstanding result.",
         "Go to Slide 28, give you a quick overview of the Cooper Basin joint venture operated by Santos. It's very pleasing to see FY '20 production reach 8.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, 6% higher than the prior year. JV also recorded a 111% 2P reserves replacement. Beach remains highly supportive of the joint venture's efforts to high-grade drilling opportunities in FY '21. Beach expects to participate in 40 to 50 wells with a focus also on infrastructure opportunities to support improved reliability and capacity. Excitingly, Beach plans to work with Santos to explore the potential of carbon capture and storage in the basin, this work being evaluated in the first half of FY '21.",
         "As we move through Slide 29, we're now about to change gears to turn our attention to the updated 5-year outlook. On Slide 30, you can see FY '21 is scheduled to be Beach's biggest investment year with the full year of offshore Victorian Otway program, the full year of Waitsia Stage 2 construction and the continued aggressive Cooper Basin drilling program. However, given macro issues, more than 30% of planned FY '21 expenditure will be deferred in capital expenditure at a range of between $650 million to $750 million. This will mean the capital expenditure forecast for FY '22 and beyond will be higher and spending is deferred into those years.",
         "Additionally, FY '20 to '24 cumulative CapEx increased by around $200 million to $4.2 billion as new growth opportunities have been identified. These include follow-up drilling and development in the Perth Basin following exploration success at Beharra Springs Deep, increased Western Flank investment following the FY '20 successes and Kupe joint venture considering a new well to extend plateau beyond FY '24.",
         "Slide 31. It should be no surprise that a deferral of FY '21 activities delay a potential production contribution from some of the assets. Despite this, production remains on track to deliver between 37 million to 43 million barrels of oil equivalent in FY '25. In essence, the destination hasn't changed, only the timing and the profile to reach it.",
         "In the current environment, we believe this is the prudent approach to ensure Beach maintains financial strength through a period of volatility. Importantly, a significant increase in production over the next 5 years comes from known sources within our existing portfolio.",
         "Slide 32. You can see that we've taken a conservative approach to forecasting production of 37 million barrels of oil equivalent by FY '25. In the interest of being prudent, our key assumptions in the low case are things that are virtually certain as opposed to further upside. Even in the 43 million barrel of oil equivalent scenario, you can see outcomes that are likely given our previous track record of delivery especially in the Western Flank and the Perth Basin. The high case does not rely on material exploration success.",
         "Slide 33. Here, you can see our revised free cash flow outlook to reflect the revised work program, and of course, most importantly, the updated commodity price assumptions. Our updated assumptions forecast Brent oil price at USD 41.25 per barrel in FY '21, USD 53.50 a barrel in FY '22 and USD 60 a barrel from FY '23 with an underlying exchange rate of $0.70. Under these assumptions and the updated production and CapEx assumptions, Beach is forecast to generate $2.1 billion in cumulative free cash flow FY '21 through to FY '25. That demonstrates some exciting times ahead for us at Beach.",
         "Flipping through to Slide 35, we cover our FY '21 guidance. FY '21 production is expected to be between 26 million and 28.5 million barrels of oil equivalent, reflecting an optimized approach to capital expenditure as we seek to lower capital while maintaining production. On that front, CapEx is forecast between $650 million and $750 million while underlying EBITDA is forecast between $900 million and $1 billion. Beach will continue to be vigilant around reducing field operating costs, guidance ranging from $8.25 to $8.75 per barrel.",
         "Slide 36 outlines some more granularity on our FY '21 production. Really pleasing thing to see here is the significant increase in oil production we expect to achieve. Oil output from our Cooper Basin assets increases from 8.8 million barrels in FY '20 to between 9.2 million and 10.2 million barrels in FY '21. Forecast increase is driven through maintaining operated Western Flank output of 20,000 barrels per day through FY '21. Gas production is expected to be in the range of 13.7 million to 14.7 million barrels of oil equivalent. Gas production is impacted by natural field decline at both Kupe and the Victorian Otway Basin. However, this was expected to decline ahead of the compression project completion at Kupe, the start-up of the offshore drilling program in Victoria. Victorian Otway is also impacted by a 23-day planned shutdown in November 2020.",
         "At the same time, production is expected to increase in the Perth Basin, the start-up of Waitsia Stage 1 and also the connection of Beharra Springs Deep-1 well around mid-FY '21. Meanwhile, Cooper Basin gas production is expected to stay steady.",
         "Slide 37 provides more granularity on FY '21 CapEx. Here, we show you a split in expenditure by type, by asset, by the end target. Top-left chart highlights our focus on development CapEx in FY '21 as we look to temporarily reduce our exploration and appraisal spend. Consistent with our thematic outlined earlier, 65% of our investment in FY '21 is targeting East Coast gas suppliers.",
         "Looking at this granular spend, it's critical I'll point out, approximately 40% of FY '21 capital expenditure to generate production volumes in FY '21. The remaining 60% is targeting production growth in future years. What we've said previously still rings true: this is about creating sustainable growth business.",
         "Slide 38 highlights how we've continuously delivered on reducing our cost base. In FY '21, we maintain this focus to target a further 3% to 7% reduction in field operating cost per barrel compared to FY '20. As a reminder, those are Australian dollar figures.",
         "I think it's fair to say our track record of delivery and continued desire for improvement in this space has helped position Beach as a low-cost operator.",
         "Now let's move to Slide 40. As a reminder, today's key takeaways. First, we had a very solid FY '20 result despite challenging conditions. I don't think anyone on the call would have predicted the manner and the ferocity in which COVID-19 hit the global economy, not to mention our way of life including at work. Beach acted swiftly, and we were able to protect our people, our assets and ensure the continuity of our operations. As a result, underlying business continued to perform extremely well through FY '20 whilst able to navigate many challenges that are presented to us.",
         "Second, we now enter FY '21 with an incredibly strong foundation. The balance sheet is in excellent shape. We have a high-margin business, highlighted by no material impairments. We enjoy a resilient and growing 2P reserves base. On top of this, we have got an extremely robust gas business that provides a strong level of revenue certainty. In fear of being a broken record, I'll say it again: our gas revenues exceed our total operating expenditure and our stay-in-business capital expenditure.",
         "Third, Beach growth plans are unchanged but at a more conservative pace. We believe a 30% reduction in capital expenditure is prudent in the current environment to reflect the risk COVID creates and a greater economic uncertainty. The growth program is still well and truly underway. There's some clear evidence. We secured a new rig contract signed with Diamond Offshore to commence the Otway offshore drilling program. Waitsia Stage 2 FID is expected in coming months, with the ability to unlock an export opportunity. The Ironbark 1 exploration well is expected to spud in Q2 FY '20.",
         "We are confident not only in our growth portfolio but also on the fact we can invest through the cycle. We are forecast to generate $2.1 billion in cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years even taking into account a reduced commodity price outlook. We're stress-testing at a conservative USD 30 a barrel oil price over the next 5 years. And net gearing is forecast to peak at less than 10%, and committing to all of our currently identified growth opportunities. If you put those things together, it shows how well placed Beach is to succeed in the current environment. Beach came out of the mid-2015 oil price downturn as a bigger, better and stronger company. Now I have no doubt we're on the path to do the same again this time around.",
         "This marks the end of today's presentation. Would love to turn this over now to Q&A."
      ],
      "Morne Engelbrecht": [
         "Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. As Matt's already noted, the second half of FY '20 presented significant headwinds for the business. Notwithstanding this, I'm very pleased with how we've weathered the storm and how well we are currently placed.",
         "As you can see on Slide 12, we have performed extremely well on the financial front in FY '20, particularly proud of how we continue to retain a rock-solid balance sheet. We have $50 million in net cash and have access to more than $500 million in liquidity.",
         "As previously stated, we have not had any impairments across our producing assets. Our reserves remain economic to lower long-term commodity prices. On that point, Beach has a high level of revenue certainty based on our stable natural gas business. Over 99% of our gas was sold under contract, which was fixed price and present a natural hedge and downside protection. In FY '20, Beach generated more than $600 million in sales gas and ethane revenues. Importantly, these revenues cover all of our operating costs and stay-in-business costs.",
         "FY '20, we achieved our goal to reduce our direct controllable operating costs by $30 million per annum. Despite this, we continue to remain disciplined on costs. As such, we are targeting further reductions in field operating costs per barrel, which is incorporated into our dollars per BOE guidance for FY '21. We are reviewing all of our contracts to identify areas of further cost savings, and we have optimized our workforce to match the modified work programs going forward.",
         "On Slide 13, you can see our financial highlights for FY '20. Beach reported an underlying EBITDA of $1.108 billion for FY '20. This outcome was a result of 21% decrease in realized oil prices, partly offset by a 7% increase in realized gas and ethane prices and the inclusion of $21 million with the Tawhaki 1 exploration dry-hole well cost. Otway sale also impacted production and sales volumes, and it is important to note that production was 2% higher on a pro forma basis.",
         "On Slide 14, you can see our cash movements. Operating cash flow of $874 million was down 16% on the prior year. This was driven by a 14% reduction in sales revenue and $134 million increase in cash tax payments.",
         "As Matt stated earlier, Beach has announced a final dividend of $0.01 per share fully franked.",
         "Turning to Slide 15. You can see our underlying NPAT movements over FY '20, which recorded an underlying NPAT of $461 million in FY '20. This represented an 18% decline on the previous year and was mainly caused by the sale of the 40% interest in Victorian Otway assets, a 24% reduction on realized U.S. dollar liquids prices, which was partially offset by a lower Australian dollar and higher Australian dollar gas prices.",
         "Slide 16 is an important slide as I think it best illustrates our balance sheet strength. As you can see, saying Beach is in a robust position at low oil prices is an understatement. Current projections have Beach remaining in a net cash position through a peak investment year at USD 40 per barrel. Even in a scenario where oil remained flat at USD 30 per barrel to the 5-year outlook, net gearing is forecast not to surpass 10%. Can I repeat that? Less than 10% net gearing while fully funding all of our identified growth projects even at a low oil price scenario of USD 30 per barrel. It's the balance sheet strength that gives Beach the flexibility to pursue our growth opportunity set. We have a substantial portfolio of high value-accretive organic growth opportunities, which we'll pursue in a prudent and responsible manner. Furthermore, Beach can remain selective and disciplined in relation to M&A opportunities.",
         "Last point I want to make on this slide is that our balance sheet means we will focus our free cash flow generation priorities towards growth and reinvestment. However, we will consider capital returns for surplus capital if we believe it's appropriate and makes sense.",
         "Our current balance sheet strength means we can weather periods of heightened oil price volatility and economic uncertainty. Our net position -- cash position, combined with our robust gas business, means Beach has a natural hedge against any volatility. This remains a growth company, and our priority for capital allocation remains growing total shareholder returns via value-accretive growth investments.",
         "I'd now like to hand back to Matt."

         "Remarks": [
            "First question is just on the cumulative free cash flow guidance. Just trying to reconcile why the FY '21 to '25 period results in the same $2.7 billion in free cash flow as the old FY '20 to '24 outlook at constant commodity prices. Now I note that when I read up your charts, the production is a little bit higher for the new guidance. And I think that it's hard to see why that higher production would be completely offset by the $200 million higher CapEx guidance because at the end of the day, that CapEx is going into very high-margin opportunities like Western Flank oil. So the inference I have is that the margin expectation for the business is lower than it had been previously. And I wanted to understand whether that line of thinking was fair or whether I'd missed the mark. Just trying to reconcile there the old and new guidance, please."

There's no material change in expected margins in that number but is really just driven by cost in, cost out. And there's probably some product issues in there as well. So that's the totality of the outcome. So it's $2.7 billion before we amend the commodity prices, and after we amend the commodity prices for the downturn, it's $2.1 billion."

You still have plenty of balance sheet headroom, certainly upside, I think, for most of us when we think about long-term oil price. I appreciate you want to run a conservative balance sheet, but I wanted to understand, with that headroom, you said at a preference, you're investing in more organic growth over capital returns.

It gives us optionality, as you just said, to weigh up the investment across the 6 -- the operating hubs that we currently work through. That gives us the opportunity to look at M&A. I think the issue around M&A is, as we said, in the last 5 years here, we are always looking at M&A opportunities. We looked at every single M&A opportunity, frankly, in Australia and New Zealand in the last 5 years, and we've hit the trigger on one. So we'll look at many, but we're incredibly selective because we've got a great base business that it has to stack up against. So we have the optionality going forward.

So we do see a lot of reinvestment opportunity. We're getting our heads clear on Birkhead opportunities because we think there's more upside there. And obviously, we also have potential in the Perth Basin to continue to grow and as well as -- and as we mentioned, we've got potential for more wells in Kupe.

Now let's suppose that a big field like a Browse or a Scarborough or even, fingers crossed, an Ironbark was to come into North West Shelf. I would have thought that those big fields would have had priority over the Arledge in the processing capacity over a smaller field like a Waitsia. Now some of the modeling we've done in the past said if you saw North West Shelf decline at a reasonable rate or outperform expectations on decline, that there might not be room for everybody.",

And if there is interruptibility, how does that affect your LNG strategy you're marketing?"

So we're very comfortable with the profile of the Arledge that we have and the commerciality of it. It's really not much more I can tell you, right, today.

We've got a very small minute relative to that number, a number that we have to put into an onshore gas plant at Waitsia.

Clearly, you're best off marketing when you've got more certainty around the profile and the project itself. We've done soft testing at the market today.

So we're $2.7 billion versus $2.7 billion. Now fortunately, this year, you haven't given us as much information having provided the year-by-year free cash flow. But if you go back to last year's guidance, you basically guided to effectively no free cash flow in FY '20. That meant you were guiding to $2.7 billion of free cash flow FY '21 to FY '24.",

Now if that's the case, that means you're only doing $1.7 billion of free cash flow FY '21 to FY '24 now versus $2.7 billion previously guided. Can you confirm those numbers are broadly correct? And if so, where did that $1 billion of free cash flow pre-commodity price changes go?"

So there's difference in product mix, there's difference in timing of projects as we pointed to relative to the previous guidance, obviously, particularly in the offshore Otway and also on Waitsia. So there's a number of ins and outs around that. I think the main message here is to let the market know that without the change in commodity prices, we are still -- we were still on track for a very large amount of free cash flow over the next 5 years even after announced commodity price change..."

I mean $1 billion missing is not commodity assumptions here or there. That's a huge number. So I guess the only conclusion is it's not $1 billion in the first 4 years. In FY '25, free cash flow is going to be materially lower than you previously guided for FY '24. Can you steer us towards which one of those 2 assumptions might be right?"

Do you not think that puts you in a slightly weaker marketing position if you've already committed to the project? You've just said publicly 10 minutes ago that you plan to sell all the volume.

So you're talking about companies preparing to spend $10 billion to $20 billion of capital. Now even if you're a super major, as we've seen super majors do, you need to take a P90 assumption on your volumes. You need to get the reserves done. You need to basically presell before you can commit to that sort of number. We don't have that sort of capital exposure. And we're getting told through someone else's plant, so this is a very different situation.",

So what you're seeing on the ACCC, I really can add to. You're getting the actual data there, so there is not much more I can add quite genuinely."

So once these opportunities -- once Waitsia is committed and up and running, obviously, it's an incremental cost story at that point. So longer term as well, there'll be more gas to put into the market via infrastructure that we've put in place, which will also be supporting LNG.",

We've already been active in the last 12 months. So that's why you'll see on that chart on Slide 23 domestic gas sales is going across the entire span of the range of the deep because we've been active in all of those years."

It's a very simple tie-in. The existing facilities are more than capable of handling the pressures and temperatures associated with that well, and future development wells will be very much the -- in the same position. So the question really is, if we undertake appraisal drilling, which we're planning to do in FY '22, is there a justified case for expanding those facilities when you're into a different set of engineering issues? But fundamentally, the existing facilities can handle that gas."

So we've got a good understanding, and we're obviously live in all of those discussions ourselves. Look, the key still is we've got great support to Beach and what we're doing because we are obviously leading the charge on investment for more gas supply into the East Coast. And we're doing that through the Cooper, but most importantly, we're also doing that through the Otway. So we and our partners are spending in the order of $1 billion to get more gas into the East Coast market. We've got great support from regulators and governments in relation to that. But I do believe that some of the dialogue around some of gas pricing, et cetera, relative to the U.S. and other countries is probably not well informed. So I think if you look at some of the expert reports on what the cost of supply is into the East Coast, it requires numbers that are similar to what you're seeing at the moment in terms of pricing."

Just firstly on Otway, when you talk about natural field decline for Otway in FY '21, I just want to understand why you're seeing that decline in FY '21 given you've had Black Watch come online recently, presenting about 1/3 of the prevailing capacity. I mean that looks like a very steep decline rate. How should we be thinking about decline in Otway over the next 18 months?"

So clearly, the asset was built down a decline curve path until we came in to arrest it. I think you see this slide on the Otway Basin. I think it's Slide 25. You will see that we've put a chart in there, which shows you a pretty clear view with what we think will happen in terms of the Otway Gas Plant.

And we do think there's a fair bit of upside left in the basin, including McKinlay.
