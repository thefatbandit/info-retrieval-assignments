         "Thank you, Erin, and welcome everyone to Spirit Airlines\u2019s second quarter earnings call. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call will be archived on our website for 60 days. Presenting on today\u2019s call are Ted Christie, Spirit\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; Scott Haralson, our Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Klein, our Chief Commercial Officer. Also joining us on the call today are other members of our senior leadership team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for sell-side analysts.",
         "Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company\u2019s current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements are included in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements.",
         "In comparing results today, we will be adjusting on periods to exclude the special items. Please refer to our second quarter 2020 earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures.",
         "Ted, I now turn the call over to you.",
         "Thank you. We\u2019re now ready to take questions from the analysts. We ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. Erin, we\u2019re ready to begin."

      "Matt Klein": [
         "Thanks, Scott. I also want to thank our Spirit team. Throughout the upheaval caused by the pandemic and economic crisis, our team has pulled together to support one another and the communities we serve. I\u2019m inspired by our entire team and proud of everyone\u2019s dedication during this unprecedented time. As others in our industry have commented, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on travel demand. Our total operating revenue in the second quarter declined 86.3% year-over-year. As Ted and Scott both indicated, the demand environment has been volatile. Our flown load factor in April was 17.9% on a 76% reduction in year-over-year capacity. The May flown load factor was 65% on a nearly 94% reduction in capacity, and the June flown load factor reached 79.1% on a 79% reduction in capacity.",
         "We were very encouraged by the trends we were seeing for summer travel throughout the month of June. But unfortunately, as the headlines turned negative in mid-June regarding the increase of COVID-19 cases, demand for July pulled off a bit. Having said that, we anticipate July flown load factor will be in the low to mid-60s. We anticipated the recovery would be rocky, and it certainly has been. On an ASM basis, July capacity is estimated to be down 18% year-over-year, August down 35% and September down 45% year-over-year. This equates to third quarter capacity being down 32% compared to the third quarter last year.",
         "International travel bans are still restricting us from serving many of our international destinations. But once the bans are lifted, it remains our intent to bring back service to all the destinations we served prior to COVID-19. In the international markets where we have reinstituted service, visiting friends and relatives are a big part of the demand segment and we expect it to be so with other destinations once they open. As such, we anticipate we will add back service to our VFR markets first and broaden our service as more tourism-oriented destinations come back online.",
         "The timing of stabilized demand recovery remains uncertain, but it will recover. The economy of the United States is resilient and has always bounced back stronger than it was before any previous crisis presented itself. Based on history, we believe price-sensitive travelers going to visit their friends and relatives will be among the first travel segments to rebound, followed closely by low-fare leisure travel. Both of these segments are core to our network, we are in a great position to offer low fares and doing so at a profit.",
         "And now I\u2019ll hand it back to Ted."

      "Operator": [
         "Welcome to the 2Q 2020 Conference Call. My name is Erin, and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]",
         "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Maria Cuartas, Senior Analyst, Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin."
      ],
      "Scott Haralson": [
         "Thanks, Ted. I join Ted in thanking the entire Spirit team for helping us navigate through this crisis. The last few months have been challenging, and our team\u2019s perseverance has been inspiring.",
         "To our financials, for the second quarter, our adjusted net loss was $286 million or a loss of $3.59 per share. Adjusted operating expenses for the second quarter 2020 decreased 43.3% year-over-year to $481 million. These changes were primarily driven by a 92.5% decrease in fuel expense and reductions in other flight volume-related expenses. Salaries, wages and benefits expense was about flat compared to the same period last year, despite an 11.6% increase in our pilot and flight attendant workforce prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "Enhancing and preserving liquidity remains the top priority. We ended the second quarter with $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. During the second quarter, we completed a public offering of common stock, netting us proceeds of $192.4 million, completed a convertible debt offering, netting us proceeds of $168.3 million; and we increased our senior secured revolving credit facility from $110 million to $180 million, of which we drew the full $180 million during the second quarter. These transactions bring our total liquidity raise through financing transactions since the onset of the pandemic to over $540 million.",
         "And last night, we launched an at-the-money offering for 9 million shares of our common stock, which, if executed at yesterday\u2019s closing price, would yield about $150 million. In addition, we received proceeds from the Payroll Support Program portion of the CARES Act for $301 million and expect to receive the remaining $33 million of proceeds before the end of July. We are pursuing additional financing for our unencumbered assets.",
         "We currently have traditional unencumbered assets that are valued at approximately $600 million and intangible assets, such as our FREE SPIRIT loyalty and $9 Fare Club programs, as well as other brand-related assets that we believe could be used as collateral to raise significant additional proceeds. We have applied for a loan under the CARES Act secured loan program. If approved, we are eligible for up to $741 million, and we have until September 30 to determine whether or not to participate.",
         "Regarding our fleet plan, we have reached agreement with Airbus to defer some of our 2020 and 2021 aircraft deliveries and corresponding predelivery deposits. For the remainder of this year, we will now only take three additional aircraft, bringing our total 2020 deliveries to 12 versus 16 previously. For 2021, we now have 16 aircrafts scheduled for delivery versus 25 previously. You can find a copy of our updated fleet plan on our website.",
         "Of the three remaining deliveries this year, two will be debt financed, and the final delivery will be financed with the sale-leaseback transaction. 10 of the 16 deliveries in 2021 are secured under direct lease arrangements, and we have not yet secured financing for the remaining six. We expect to use sale-leaseback financing for these six aircrafts, the first of which is not scheduled for delivery until June 2021.",
         "Total capital expenditures for this year are estimated to be approximately $560 million or $215 million net of financing. The amounts not financed in this year are primarily related to predelivery deposit payments. For the remainder of the year, we estimate our capital expenditures will be $112 million or $28 million net of financing. The majority of these expenditures are related to aircraft. As we progress through the second quarter, our cash burn declined primarily due to an improvement in net sales. We define average daily cash burn as the sum of operating cash flows, debt service, total CapEx net of financing and predelivery deposit payments. It does not include the impact of any other financings, capital raises or funds from the Payroll Support Program.",
         "Our average daily cash burn trended from about $9.5 million in April to about $1.5 million in June. As Ted mentioned, our cash burn in June included a one-time principal payment of nearly $50 million related to an amendment of our PDP financing facility in conjunction with our Airbus aircraft deferral agreement. On our first quarter call back in early May, we previously guided to cash burn levels of around $4 million per day for May and June. However, we ended up at just under $3 million per day for those two months, excluding the PDP facility payment, which was not contemplated in our $4 million per day estimate.",
         "Looking forward, based on current demand trends and the operation levels, Matt will discuss, we estimate our average daily cash burn for the third quarter 2020 will range between $3 million and $4 million per day. Before I close, I want to address the question as to how we can maintain our cost advantage in this environment, even if our utilization is temporarily lower than in previous years. Our cost advantage comes from four things, higher utilization, higher density seating configuration, more efficient fuel burn and overall lower cost. In the end, the higher utilization has the smallest impact of the four, while our structurally low overall cost base is the largest contributor to that advantage.",
         "In fact, if we would have operated the daily utilization at the industry average of almost 11 hours per day in 2019, we would still have a CASM ex of well under $0.06. This is still half of the CASM ex of the three largest carriers and 30% to 40% lower than the other lower cost airlines. Point being, our cost advantage is here to stay. All airlines are going to be facing short-term utilization reductions and it impacts everyone\u2019s cost structure. With that, here\u2019s Matt."

      "Ted Christie": [
         "Thanks, Maria, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I want to start by saying I\u2019m very proud of how the entire Spirit team has responded to the changes driven by COVID-19. Many of our procedures, processes and work environments have changed, all while our personal lives have been disrupted. Our team has done an incredible job adapting as necessary, while maintaining their focus on delivering the best value in the sky.",
         "As we begin to welcome our guests back, we are taking purposeful steps to provide a safe and healthy experience for our guests and team members. We continue to expand and enhance our cleaning procedures. During the quarter, we launched antimicrobial fogging of our facilities and aircraft, which is effective against the coronavirus. This new process further improves upon our existing high-grade disinfectant fogging. In addition to these and other enhanced cleaning procedures, we are enforcing our policy that guests and team members must wear a mask while on board. These enhancements, coupled with the most advanced air handling and filtration systems onboard any aircraft line today, we believe create a safe and healthy environment for all.",
         "Financially, our top priority is to conserve cash and enhance our liquidity position. Given the significant decline in demand due to COVID-19, we dramatically reduced our flight schedule for the second quarter. During the month of April, we made several significant schedule cuts given the highly suppressed demand environment, operating only about 50 flights per day. In May, given the weak demand, we continued to operate this minimum schedule. We increased flying in June as a result of encouraging, albeit tenuous signs of demand rebounding. These favorable dynamics, our low-cost structure, a relatively-strong June and an uptick in forward bookings for July, resulted in favorable cash dynamics for the month of June.",
         "In connection with the finalization of our aircraft deferral agreement with Airbus, we also amended our 2018 PDP financing facility, extending the expiration date from December of this year to March of 2021. Due to deferring aircraft and amending this financing facility, in June, we made a principal payment of nearly $50 million. If not for this one-time principal payment, we would have achieved nearly zero average daily cash burn for the month of June.",
         "This, of course, doesn\u2019t mean we are through the worst of it. In fact, with the recent barrage of headlines regarding the increase in new coronavirus cases, we\u2019ve seen another setback in demand. We expect the rest of the summer to remain challenging for us and the industry. However, when demand for leisure travel rebounds and stabilizes, as evidenced by our June results, our leading low-cost structure positions us well to be among the first to return to profitability.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott to discuss more details of our quarterly performance.",
         "Thanks, Matt. The continued health and economic crises that have caused unprecedented challenges on many fronts. Social unrest in our country is another challenge we must overcome. Now more than ever, we need to unite as a country and stand together against racism and bigotry of any kind. At Spirit, we celebrate our differences and know that we are stronger together because of them. Despite these challenges, our team has remained dedicated to provide excellent service to our guests and each other and to offer compassion for those around us. I am humbled and encouraged by the heart of the Spirit team.",
         "In times of economic and societal crises such as this, the power of travel and human connection is ever more needed. In any macro setup, fares are the single most important component of anyone\u2019s air travel selection. And the simple truth is that Spirit is best suited to carry plane loads of low fares. As our cost structure and network construction give us the tools to do so in a profitable and sustainable way, nothing precludes any carrier from offering low fares. However, only a low-cost airline can do so and win.",
         "History has shown in a multitude of past recessions that low-cost airlines outperform the market. Some have questioned the sustainability of the low-cost model, be it because of utilization, density or lack of hubs. The facts and economic realities favor our model during periods such as this. Discussions about market share, marginal cost and hub economics are irrelevant to our business model. We will selectively deploy our assets in ways that we believe drive the best possible return, get us through cash neutrality, and on our way back to profitability.",
         "While it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to when demand will return to normal, one thing is very clear, the margin of travelers needed for Spirit to achieve these goals is significantly narrower than it is for any other airline. With that, back to Maria."

But could you help us understand just how the year-over-year kind of net revenue progressed? And kind of what your expectations would be, especially given the noise around seasonality?"

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. I don\u2019t introduce, and Matt can jump in here as well. So as we indicated in the second quarter, revenue really began to move in a positive direction relative to our size, of course. Throughout the later part of May and into June, and we added capacity into the summer period as a reaction to that. Once we head into the fall, it\u2019s a seasonally off-peak period of time. And I think it\u2019s fair to say September and October are going to be very off-peak this period. So I think you would expect that year-over-year revenues would be challenged in that period of time when compared to the experience we had thus far for the latter part of the second quarter and into the early part of July. But Matt, do you want to give any more specifics?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Ted Christie"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I think, Savi, as we think about the progression through the summer, I think it\u2019s important to note that the peak periods have performed relatively well. Again, this is all on a relative basis, of course. July 4 holiday was strong. There\u2019s a lot of travel demand out there. Our \u2013 I think, evidenced by what we\u2019re going to do from a load factor perspective in the month of July still speaks to demand is out there. What we\u2019re being very aware of and recognize is that as we get out of the summer into the fall, traditionally off-peak periods will continue to be traditionally off-peak.",
            "So we\u2019re expecting there to be a normal progression, probably a little more exaggerated this year for obvious reasons. And then we\u2019re just thinking about how we prepare ourselves as we head through September and into the fourth quarter and then hit the holiday periods again at the end of this year. So a little bit of \u2013 I\u2019m not going to give you exact numbers on how the revenue is progressing through the summer into the fall, but that\u2019s kind of the way we\u2019re thinking about off-peak periods heading back into peak periods."

         "Remarks": [
            "That\u2019s actually \u2013 still helpful. Thank you. And then on \u2013 just on the cost trend, I\u2019m kind of curious now that you\u2019re pulling down capacity again into the third quarter, but still above kind of the second quarter, just should we assume kind of a lower year-over-year declines? Or is there anything else that we should consider as further cost actions are taken?"

            "Hey, good morning, everybody. I guess two questions here related to Scott. The secured loan program under the CARES Act, the $741 million, the way it reads in the release, it does sound like that it\u2019s up to $741 million and the actual loan may be actually less than that. And I\u2019m just curious, you highlighted $600 million of unencumbered traditional collateral that could be pledged and then you highlighted some other items without a monetary amount.",
            "Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but does it suggest that maybe you wouldn\u2019t have enough collateral to back the $741 million, or maybe it would require almost all of your collateral that you have, both traditional and non-traditional? I don\u2019t have a sense of what the potential LTD is. Can you just add some color to that on that $741 million and whether or not you have a sizable collateral pool to back that?"

And we expect that we\u2019re going to be pretty close to the value that\u2019s needed for the government loan. We\u2019re still in the process of finalizing the valuation and how the government would take those assets, but we do expect we\u2019d have enough to cover the loan if we wanted to do that, but not require any other tangible assets."

And then just actually my second question, and again, back to you, when I think about your ATL, so from the March quarter to the June quarter, it moved from $411 million to $452 million, and that makes sense when you think about what your future sales are as you head into a peak period.",
            "How about \u2013 as we think about the split, though, call it, traditional tickets that are on the books that have been purchased versus what is potential refunds, did that split change all that much from March to June? I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like a one-third, two-thirds, carriers have sort of \u2013 the demarcation seems to be split along those lines. I\u2019m just curious if there was a shift here if it was what you saw at June quarter end, still very similar to what you\u2019re seeing at March quarter end? Thank you."

Ted, I think given that you announced the order book restructuring, can you give us any insight into how you\u2019re thinking about 2021 or even the normalized period? How fast do you want to resume growth? And do you think you could even do it before we get like a vaccine out here for this virus as some of your other competitors have highlighted that maybe demand will come back until we have that outcome?"

      "20": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Hey, Brandon. Sure. So obviously, we worked \u2013 Scott and the team work closely with Airbus to create a little bit more breathing room for us with regard to the order book. But another component of our fleet that remains that exists today that is somewhat \u2013 we\u2019ve described as kind of a swing component of our fleet is the entirely-owned 319 fleet, which is somewhere between 25 and 30 airplanes, it\u2019s in that ballpark. And we reserve the right to use those airplanes or not at any given point, either at regular utilization, lower utilization or not at all. And so the work we did with Airbus gives us a decent amount of breathing room with regard to deliveries, CapEx and also flexibility as it relates to timing the recovery. And then additional shock absorber is using those other aircraft to help us time it a little bit better.",
            "The core of your question, which is what is the \u2013 what is our expectation and when will we time the recovery? Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have any fresh information on that that would help you. But we are using the real-time information that we\u2019re seeing today to help guide our views on what the fourth quarter peak will look like, what will look like heading into the spring of next year. It is our expectation, by the way, that the company will resume its growth. That, as Matt mentioned, eventually, the economy will recover. Leisure travelers are returning to the market already. And we expect that, that will continue. It\u2019s going to be bumpy.",
            "And so navigating that window of time is really the crux of the issue. And Spirit is assembling a level of resources to be able to do that with fleet flexibility, with deferral rights and making sure that we have the appropriate capital on board to navigate it. So I don\u2019t have a definitive date as to when we expect that to happen because we\u2019re digesting real-time information, but I think we have created enough flexibility to be able to do it when it happens."

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, I appreciate that response, Ted. And I guess this question can be difficult to answer, but is this a situation where you got to build it and they will come? Or how do you manage capacity in this environment? Do you wait to see the bookings then had to the schedule? Help us out for folks that don\u2019t run an airline?"

      },
      "22": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Well, it\u2019s a great question. And we mentioned this on our May call that we were not intending to lead the recovery. We\u2019re going to evaluate the market, see where demand recovers and then deploy into it, which is exactly what we did in June and July. And I think that worked well for us. If you\u2019ve seen from our forward schedules, we are removing capacity versus the peak in July as we head into August and September. And I think that shouldn\u2019t shock anybody because as Matt mentioned, it is an off-peak period, and we don\u2019t intend to try to drag the market to recovery. We\u2019re going to evaluate it. And that will mean we\u2019re going to have to continue to move the network in and out, depending on the seasonality and the pace of the recovery.",

So when compared to a normalized period, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s impossible to tell because I think demand trend is choppy, I think that the capacity movements across the various airlines are different, and individual strategies around which type of traffic to target and that sort of thing. Those are all not normal today. So I think it\u2019s impossible to kind of characterize it.",
            "What I will say is that our activity in June and July has reinforced that low fares can bring back activity. And as the kind of media market and the news cycle in late May and early June began to turn more favorable, and we were looking towards a relaxation of restriction, leisure travelers were like a coiled spring, they were ready to come back low fares, okay? And admittedly, that has hit another bump in the road here because the new cycle has gone the other way. The numbers clearly in our home state of Florida are not encouraging. And as you know, our network is largely Florida. We have 45% to 50% of the network touches Florida. And so even specifically to us, we probably have a little bit more of a challenge right now as Florida navigates its issue.",

Has there been a difference in demand progression in the COVID hotspot states, if you will, pardon me, versus the rest of the network?

Back when things first started, and things started to pop up in the New York metro area relatively quickly, we basically stopped flying to the New York metro area for a period of time based on that information that was sort of at the outset of the outbreaks earlier. As that got better, we added more service back into the New York metro area.",

We have a relatively large presence in Myrtle Beach. And Myrtle Beach, for example, has had some negative news, and then you see bookings relatively quickly kind of tail off and there\u2019s an impact with cancellations as well. So as the headlines move around the country, then you start to see cancellations pop up and a lack \u2013 and a reduction in gross demand at the same time. We\u2019re not going to be immune to that. That\u2019s happening to every airline across the country.",

We\u2019re \u2013 we have some presence in California, but we\u2019re not a major player in California. That may impact airlines really soon that are bigger players in California.

But what I can do is probably walk you through some of the math of how that may play out. I mean we start today with $1.2 billion cash balance, and we have an ATM in the marketplace that you can take a guesstimate on how much we take of that in the year. We have the government loan or some type of program, where we use the frequent flyer program and $9 Fare Club as collateral. So you can take you a guesstimate on how much we could take from there.",

And then we\u2019ve given guidance on cash burn of $3 million to $4 million for the third quarter. You can probably expect the fourth quarter directionally to be a little bit better than that. We\u2019re not going to give a number because we\u2019re not sure where that\u2019s going to play out, but directionally a little bit better. So that could get you to sort of a year-end cash balance that we\u2019re looking at, or at least a ballpark.",

Or I mean, is that something that you\u2019d even consider doing right now, maybe going out with RFPs to position for when things normalize?

What\u2019s front of mind obviously is navigating the crisis right now, focusing on liquidity, cash burn, using the network to enhance those types of things. But with that said, as we \u2013 as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect that as the economy begins to recover, that our travel segment will be leading that. And we believe that Spirit will be at the front end of it of that travel segment. So evaluating our opportunities throughout the course of this crisis, while not the first thing that I wake up and think about in the morning and the last thing I think about at night, is a component of it.",

And so thinking about how to pursue that is one of our projects. Again, not the first one, but something that we think we can do, whether or not it\u2019s exploring unique airport partnerships or expanding in areas that were previously difficult for us to gain access or looking at our existing franchises, the way we fly today, be it in large leisure destinations or even international, and are there ways for us to capitalize upon our geography, quite frankly.

And included in that could be rightsizing a fleet and/or rightsizing of other fixed-related expenses and that sort of thing.",

And so while those are on the table, we continue to look at ways to mitigate the need for an involuntary action post September, 30. But right now, I think we\u2019re still reading the game film to be honest, because the summer has been up and down both sides, and we want to make sure that we digest all the information before we make a call.

And that\u2019s the \u2013 when I said, navigating the period of time by which we believe we\u2019re in this down \u2013 still in the shoulder part of this down, would guide our decision on whether or not that\u2019s true and we haven\u2019t yet made that call. But those are the working parts. It\u2019s the fleet count and the return to demand."

They\u2019re hanging in there actually. So those charges seem to be ones, it\u2019s part of our model, it\u2019s core to our model and our customers are continuing to act in a normal way there.",

So maybe first a clarification, did your agreement with Airbus to defer aircraft end up resulting in a slightly larger reduction to 2020 CapEx than that $185 million target you called out last quarter? I think on my math, I was getting closer to $210 million, although there could be some other moving pieces there. And then in your 10-Q, you have AerCap CapEx of $356 million for 2021, but 16 aircraft scheduled for delivery, that seems a little low. Is there something else being netted against that? I guess just probably bigger-picture question, how should we be thinking about 2021 CapEx in total? Thanks."

So if you net the PDPs for this year, we expect to have about $80 million remaining of CapEx this year. So maybe that\u2019s the difference in your 2020. In 2021, it\u2019s a little bit different because the 16 deliveries that we have, 10 of those are direct operating leases from lessors that are not part of our order book. So six that we have from Airbus during 2021 are really the CapEx of what you\u2019re trying to think about."

So if you\u2019re just talking about fleet, there are zero-cash burn airplane today, so they can they can be partially used, they can be parked or they can be retired and there\u2019s 25 of those aircraft in the fleet today. So that\u2019s going to be \u2013 which, for the size of the airline we are actually a sizable percentage of our global fleet. So I think that\u2019s the biggest component. Lease returns. We don\u2019t have any scheduled lease returns in the near-term here. So I think we\u2019d really be focused on this sub fleet of aircraft first."

And we don\u2019t have \u2013 like Ted said, we don\u2019t have a lease return until really the end of 2022. So it\u2019s the unencumbered assets that give us the flexibility."

What I will tell you, though is directionally, the ages of people on the aircraft have come down during the pandemic. So the traveling consumer on average is becoming younger on board. And along those lines also things like household income \u2013 we\u2019re tracking as much as we can, and some of those other components have changed around a little bit. As you\u2019d expect, with the younger average age, the household income has come down a little bit with that as well.",

The way that we sort of thought about it technically is, look EBITDA margin is your sort of ongoing cash generation breakeven number. So if you had a 20% EBITDA margin, you could withstand a 20% reduction in revenue to be cash breakeven as an estimate. So I think at any point below that number, if revenue declines greater than that number, you have to take a corresponding amount of fixed asset of your business, especially if you\u2019re going to operate a smaller amount of capacity. So difficult to say what that number would be. But I think from a longer-term perspective, you got to get EBITDA margin at zero to be cash breakeven."

So the setup in June was pretty good because demand was definitely coming in for the month, and we were booking July, which all airlines were doing at the time.

I think the other input is that labor volume went up because we were a growth airliner heading into this period. So we have more bodies on the property year-over-year than we would have otherwise. So I think that\u2019s offsetting some of the benefit of the voluntary lead programs that we saw. And of course, those built throughout the quarter. So we didn\u2019t get a full run rate benefit in there and we\u2019re not set up, given the company\u2019s opportunity to eventually resume its growth profile and go through recovery as leisure demand recovers, we have to determine how much of this is permanent and how much of this is temporary.",
