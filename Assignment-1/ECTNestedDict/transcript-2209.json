         "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Anglo American\u2019s First Fully Virtual Results Presentation.",
         "I\u2019m here slaving away at work. Stephen is setting in his backyard next to the pool. So if we look at each other and we\u2019re juggling between the two of us, it\u2019s just making sure that we\u2019re coordinated. Hopefully, you\u2019re all used to the format by now. We\u2019re still developing and making sure we get it right. But the most important thing is that we are connected with you, give you a chance to ask questions as well. And from our point of view, make sure that we\u2019re accessible to our shareholders.",
         "We are open for business.",
         "So I\u2019m on the first slide, which is the header. From our point of view, it\u2019s obviously been a very tough 6 months. COVID-19 is a new term we\u2019ve all had to learn and adapt to. In our case, it obviously had, it has obviously had a material impact on our operations and the business. But certainly, from our perspective, I think we finished the half strong. And we also believe that taking that improving performance into the second half will be the key to us delivering a much better full year result.",
         "In opening the presentation, I think it\u2019s also important to acknowledge all of our colleagues in Anglo American, acknowledge the communities with which we work, in which we operate and with which we work and the partnership we\u2019ve had with so many members in the community and so many stakeholders across the board. ",
         "Our WeCare program has become a cornerstone for our response to COVID, in which we focus on making sure that our people are looked after, that we\u2019re also playing our part in our local communities, even more so than we normally do, and I\u2019ll talk a little bit about that later. And from our point of view that we\u2019re making a real contribution.",
         "At the same time, we\u2019ve been working very hard to make sure that we protect the business, that we maintain business continuity, and we\u2019re rebuilding the operations after some pretty significant lockdowns in March and April. I guess the best way to show that will characterize that in numbers is in April. After the March lockdowns, we were producing at less than 60% of production capacity and by the end of June, we\u2019re at 90%. So the recovery continues. There\u2019s still got some, we\u2019ve still got some hard work to do. ",
         "And I do expect that the second half may be a little bumpy, but certainly, we\u2019re in a very different place. And I think we\u2019ve built a set of relationships with communities and governments, where they know and understand how we can help keep the economy going and at the same time, keep people safe. And I think that\u2019s the key to the future. And certainly, from our perspective, I think we\u2019ve built that foundation and that trust with our communities and with our governments that does support us in going forward.",
         "So let\u2019s jump straight into the presentation. I\u2019m going to go to Slide 3, which is the agenda, very simply put. We\u2019ll keep the order of play as usual. I\u2019ll talk about where we are today. With the world a more complex place, and I think it\u2019s important for you to know how we\u2019re dealing with the issues. Stephen will take you through the numbers and pull apart the detail, and then I will pick the ball back up and take you through how we see the forward look. And then we\u2019ll go to Q&A.",
         "So I\u2019m now on Slide 4. As we should and always do, we open with safety, health and environment. At first glance, if you look at where we\u2019ve come from over the last 7 years, we\u2019ve been significantly improving our performance in the business.",
         "In safety, about a 70% improvement in terms of our injury frequency rates, but even more important, our fatalities have dropped 93.5%. In the last 12 months, we\u2019ve lost one colleague. That\u2019s one too many, but we\u2019re making progress from where we started. Secondly, in terms of health, we\u2019ve improved our position 95% in eliminating serious health hazards throughout the business. And on environment, we\u2019ve reduced our incidents by 97%. But when you talk about those issues, it\u2019s not simply about numbers. We\u2019ve had some serious incidents in the first half, and we\u2019ve just been bloody lucky we didn\u2019t lose a colleague in those incidents. And so we\u2019ve improved the underlying performance, we still haven\u2019t delivered 0 incidents, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re focused on, and we\u2019ll continue to improve.",
         "As you\u2019re aware, on the Moranbah longwall face, we had a ground fall. We\u2019ve since recovered. We understand the issue, where we\u2019ve not had the right technical design inputting into changing geotechnical conditions. We\u2019ve actually changed the organization design to make sure that we\u2019ve got that response. And we\u2019ve also checked across the business in any other areas where we may be deficient in terms of the level of technical input, and I think we\u2019ve straightened that issue out. I guess the proof is in the pudding. We ended up getting the wall away about 3 weeks earlier than our forecast after the fall, and the operation has been going well since. And certainly, the digitization work that Tony and the team have been doing with Seamus has helped improve our performance, and we have to keep improving.",
         "In terms of the converter incident in platinum, Natascha and the team have already implemented a range of both physical and operating process controls, 8 in track. And again, we\u2019ll continue on our pathway to automation and the high, installation of hard controls in those processes where we have elevated risk. I guess in both cases, the important thing to observe as well is that our secondary safety controls, that is the flags and making sure people were clear of those areas where there was a heightened risk, ensured that we didn\u2019t have any injuries through either of those incidents. And that\u2019s a very important issue for us and a good learning as well. In terms of Grosvenor, the ignition of gas on the longwall face, it would appear, the gas was flushed through a wasteful.",
         "In looking at the other elements and learnings, we\u2019re still very much in an investigation process as is the department. But most importantly, our 5 colleagues that were injured are now making a good recovery. Some are already home. But again, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re working with the families and helping them on the rehabilitation path. I guess, most importantly, and again, the key point to stress for us as a business is that we have to continue to improve and get to 0. On health, our WeCare program was our central focus in 2020, obviously with COVID. I will talk to that a little bit. And on the environment, we\u2019ve had one incident, which was a repeat spill due to heavy range in South Africa in one of the tailings areas in the Base Metals Refinery.",
         "And again, introducing some additional engineering work to make sure that we don\u2019t have that exposure on a go-forward basis. So for us, the other two milestones that were important for us in 2020, on the environmental side, was the confirmation that we believe we can get to carbon neutrality by 2040 and that we would have at least eight operations carbon neutral by 2030.",
         "I think that -- I think the thing that characterizes us differently is we are willing and will show you when we meet a pathway to carbon neutrality that\u2019s quite unique and different in the industry. And our 2040 date is certainly leading edge in terms of industry and making sure we get there in good time.",
         "That obviously -- and that move obviously coincides with our announcement on the demerger or our intention of a potential demerger of thermal coal operations in South Africa in the two to two year timeframe. All very important milestones for us and our business and very much a statement about where the portfolio is going over the next few years.",
         "And going to the next slide, which is Slide 5 in your deck. Again, the numbers show how challenging and volatile times have been and we didn\u2019t help ourselves with those self-inflicted interruptions. But we\u2019ve still maintained our focus on improving the business and making sure that we\u2019re putting our best foot forward wherever we can.",
         "While production was down 11%, I think it\u2019s more -- it\u2019s very important to understand that at the same time -- and with the big lockdowns, we lost 20% of our working hours during the course of the first half. As I said, we were down -- or we lost almost 50% of our workforce at the end of -- towards the end of March and into April. And on a full half basis, we lost about 20% of the time available to us in terms of our production teams. So the 11% production drop is credible in that context.",
         "Our operating costs, 4% lower than we were last year, has obviously had some help from foreign exchange. But again, at the operating level, we were still down 3% or 4% against where we were last year on an apples-for-apples basis. And so I think the progress we\u2019ve made in continuing to improve our productivity has been very solid. And again, when I adjust for hours worked, our productivities were actually up 7%.",
         "So the underlying performance was strong, but obviously, big impact from lockdowns and the other measures we\u2019ve had to take as a consequence of COVID. Stephen will take you through the balance sheet details a little further. So I won\u2019t dwell any longer on the actual operating numbers other than to make one point. We\u2019ve delivered a dividend consistent with our policy, the 40% payout ratio, and that\u2019s important. And so from our perspective, we\u2019ve maintained faith with our shareholders as we said we would.",
         "In terms of defining and describing our response to COVID, we\u2019ll talk about the response in three parts. Firstly, and through our WeCare program, we focused on prevention, that is keeping people safe and hoping that we can keep them away from exposure in terms of the virus. And that includes our work in the community. Secondly, in having an exposure, how do we respond? How do we sort the business and make sure we configure the business to continue operations.",
         "And then obviously, while we\u2019re doing all of that work with the communities and doing all of that work with governments, we\u2019ve also got one eye trained very firmly on how we recover the business over time. And as I said, getting to 90% production by the end of June was very important to us. And I\u2019m still sure that it will be a bit of a bumpy ride through the second half.",
         "But the most important thing is we\u2019ve established a relationship with our communities. We\u2019ve established trust. We\u2019ve established a relationship with governments. We\u2019re providing advice and support on how they can deal with issues. We\u2019ve actually designed new ways of operating, social distancing. We have our own app, Engage, which every 1 of our employees has that helps them understand our expectations and also provides a platform to communicate how we can improve things. And so the tailoring of the business has been something quite unique. And from our perspective, there were many positives that come out of the learnings that we\u2019ve been through in terms of the business.",
         "And so the final point I\u2019d make in terms of our response and how we\u2019ve connected with our communities, this is not new to us. It\u2019s in our DNA. It\u2019s consistent with our purpose, which is around reimagine mining to improve people\u2019s lives. And again, the learnings that we\u2019ve had are significant and will certainly improve both our approach in connection with our communities and, on a longer-term basis, in terms of the way we see efficiencies and how we can work differently and more efficiently across the business.",
         "I\u2019m now on Slide 7. Just to reinforce how far we\u2019ve come in the last few years. In 2012 and with materially higher commodity prices, our industrial margin was sitting around 30%. In 2019, and with, it was almost 10% lower prices, we actually delivered margins of 42%. If I adjust for commodity price mix, we would have been at around 47% if we were back in 2012. So the improvements have been significant, and they\u2019ve been sustained in the business. Our operating costs are 30% lower. That\u2019s in nominal terms. And our productivities are double where they were back in 2012.",
         "For us, the first half was also impacted by the delay in sales. Obviously, not much going on in the diamond sector or the luxury goods sector. In PGMs, obviously the converter incident had an impact on what we get out, but we\u2019ll see both of those improve in the second half. And so we expect our sales to start picking up and certainly, the cash flow position to change to the upside as we continue to improve our sales and pull stock out of working capital.",
         "More specifically and talking about diamond, the diamond market and why we believe it\u2019s structurally attractive. As you know, the diamond market has been growing in the last 10 years. And 2009 was the last recession or the last major recession. And we\u2019ve seen consistent sales growth over that period. It\u2019s also important to note that we\u2019ve seen consistent supply growth through that period. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s changing across the industry. ",
         "Today, we\u2019ve seen continuing improvement, or we\u2019ve seen a very tough start to the year, but we\u2019ve seen continuing efficiency improvements in the business. But with the market where it is, we\u2019ve actually pulled back our production more than 20%. And we\u2019ve seen the other major player in the market pull its production back as well. And we also expect supply to fall away as smaller operators have found it more difficult to operate in these times. And with companies closing operation through resource depletion, because you can\u2019t forget we haven\u2019t seen a major new discovery in diamonds for the last 10 years, we think structurally, the prognosis is very good. Our research tells us that the market is strong. And in our case, when you look at China, which was first impacted by COVID, we saw virtually no sales in the first quarter. Yet in March and June of this year, we\u2019ve seen sales actually exceed last year\u2019s May and June figures. And the sense we have from interacting with people on the ground is very positive.",
         "Now we certainly don\u2019t expect Europe and the U.S. to recover as quickly. For us, a key selling part of the year is in the period from Thanksgiving through to the new, or through to Christmas and the New Year in the U.S. We would expect to see things pick up materially by then. But again, we\u2019re not ones to try and forecast in a month. Our stock position will be such that we can respond quickly to a change in the market. And certainly, we\u2019d expect to start to see stocks running down in the fourth quarter. But again, I\u2019ll let Stephen talk to that in terms of where we are. But given that we\u2019ve pulled production back, and we see a continuing depletion in the midstream, because there are sales actually occurring, we think the business will be in a good position by year-end and certainly be ready for a much stronger 2021.",
         "Finally, again, with supplies falling away somewhere between 15% and 20% over the next 2 or 3 years, we expect our rare product to become much rarer. And so for us, structurally, we think diamonds is in a good place. On a broader scale and across the business, and I\u2019m now on Slide 9. Our copper business has done extremely well in the first half. Great performances from Collahuasi. Los Bronces is actually starting to get some rains. So that\u2019s good news. Our costs have dropped from $1.35 to $1.07 a pound. And yes, foreign exchanges has played a part, but our operating costs have been really improving at the operating level on an apples-for-apples basis. And so thrilled with what\u2019s happening.",
         "And remember, with Quellaveco and other incremental improvements, we expect to grow our business 50%. With Quellaveco making a Q1 cost contribution to the operations, you\u2019re going to see us grow the business and reduce our operating costs. Really thrilled with the work the guys have done. In PGMs, again, we\u2019ve positioned strongly for the recovery. We\u2019ve got the second or the standby converter operating. We will have the refurbished converter operating in Q4. And so again, that will continue the recovery. And again, with Mogalakwena, almost at full rate, Amandelbult at about 70% and Natascha focusing very strongly on the stability and the performance of the processing operations, I think we\u2019re in good shape.",
         "We are still seeing infections around the communities in and around our platinum operations. But with recovery of people that had been infected actually outnumbering new infections, we\u2019re actually seeing a drift, positive drift back into the operations with people. So again, we think we\u2019re dealing and managing the issues well, and we\u2019re seeing people return to work. Across Bulks, again, another solid response, particularly pleasing with the Minas-Rio. Our ramp up through the half, I think we were about 21% of where we were last year. We actually touched nominal capacity in March. So great performance at Minas-Rio.",
         "The nickel operations also in Brazil have done exceptionally well. Seamus and the guys obviously had the Grosvenor incident in Australia, but now Moranbah and the other operations are doing well. Kumba, great recovery after the lock down in March. Timber and the team have done a great job and you will see in those results as they reported yesterday.",
         "I\u2019d also like to make a special comment and commend our Bulks team or, in particular, the marketing team in Bulks and across the board. They\u2019ve done a great job in getting our product to market. And in particular, when we had the issue with the converter, we were able to satisfy all of our customer needs in the PGM space. And I think that was a remarkable piece of work.",
         "And that is also why people probably haven\u2019t got our earnings forecast absolutely right because the marketing team have made a great contribution. So for the second half, we believe the operations are heading into more stable and capable territory. And certainly, we think the second half should be a much better half for us.",
         "And with that, I\u2019ll hand across to Stephen. Stephen, you can see? You\u2019re on.",
         "Okay. Thank you, Stephen. Now looking forward, I think it\u2019s important to make the point that the current, the last 6 months haven\u2019t changed our strategic view of things. We do think ESG issues will continue to come to the fore, but we\u2019ve been there for a long time. And certainly, the work that we\u2019ve done is starting to be recognized in terms of some of the new industries that are coming out. And our top rating in the FTSE in terms of what we\u2019re doing on the ground has been recognized. So from our point of view, all of those things matter. Consistent with that approach, and I\u2019m on Slide 19, our work on the portfolio starts obviously around Quellaveco in Peru.",
         "Now prior to the onset of COVID-19 in mid-March, we were tracking somewhere between 3 and 4 months ahead of the program. The guys have been doing a fantastic job. When the national quarantine was imposed, the majority of the project\u2019s 10,000 strong workforce were demobilized in line with the government\u2019s request and asked to head home. So we\u2019ve helped people get back to home. Construction work, as a consequence, was significantly slowed. And whilst we maintained some critical, works on critical items, we were substantially stopped across the board.",
         "With quarantine extended, we then decided to extend the lockdown for three months to give a chance for the country to get on top of COVID and, at the same time, so that we could minimize our outgoing cash expenditures with the view that we would then remobilize when we could put in place the workforce and deliver on full productivity.",
         "We thought that was the most effective way that we could contribute to the health and safety issues as well as make sure the project, when we hit the button, was able to run as hard as we could. So in taking that strategy, we\u2019re now on a restart, and it\u2019s a staged restart. We\u2019ve estimated the cost of demobilization, remobilization and the cost of the structural changes we\u2019ve made across the organization and how we\u2019ve rescheduled to make sure we reduce the peak of workforce through the process.",
         "And in doing that, we\u2019ve adjusted the financial estimate for the project to between $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion. Now that leaves us with some contingency on the expectation but it still will be a bit of a bumpy ride over the next few months, as we see secondary infections, those sorts of things. But we think we\u2019ve catered to those properly.",
         "And at the same time, we still think it\u2019s quite reasonable, and our forecast of delivering in 2022 remains on track. In fact, we\u2019re on track to the base schedule although we\u2019ve had to give back, obviously, the big gains we made prior to March. But again, a lot of work is going on to continue to improve that work.",
         "The last three months, we\u2019ve also been focused on improving the way we bring the operation up through commissioning. And so we haven\u2019t completed that work, but we\u2019ve got some positives there. So we believe we can offset any cost issues and pull back some of that improved value through the way we operate through commissioning. So I\u2019m pretty pleased with the work the guys have done, and I think we\u2019re in really good shape.",
         "In terms of crop nutrients, the U.K., despite a really tough period in lockdown, we were able to get back to work relatively quickly, implemented our social distancing rules. And where we\u2019ve been somewhere like 30% or 40% above on productivity in the underground operation by changing and reconfiguring.",
         "We\u2019re not quite at that level above our plan, but we are on track to deliver the planned works for the year. That is the $300 million. So Chris and the guys have done a fantastic job. And as we look at the business and we look at the market potential, we\u2019re happier today than we were on the day we bought the asset on the basis of what we\u2019ve seen. The guys have done a great job.",
         "Yes, there\u2019ll be some technical adjustments but they\u2019re at the margin. We think, generally, the team has got the configuration right. And from our point of view, the market and the interest we\u2019ve had in the market for the product has really been positive, particularly when you think about the new world in terms of fertilizers and what we\u2019ll have to see in agriculture in terms of smart use of fertilizers.",
         "We think the products will be producing are certainly made-to-order for that new world. So very happy with where we are on Woodsmith. In terms of the transition from thermal coal, I think it\u2019s important to remember that as we transition out of thermal coal, we\u2019re building crop nutrients.",
         "And the crop nutrients business probably has got a double the potential contribution it can make to the business. So we think that\u2019s a pretty good swap. In thermal coal, we\u2019ve already reduced our footprint by 55%, back in \u201815, \u201816 when we sold assets that we didn\u2019t think could make a material contribution in the longer term. So We\u2019re well on the way. Today, it represents 5% of the EBITDA across the business and probably reducing over time, given the price forecast. We expect to be out of the business within 2 to 3 years. And from our point of view, that\u2019s a good place to be.",
         "But at the same time, we\u2019ve got to acknowledge that they are and remain low-cost competitive assets, albeit with a relatively shorter mine life than the balance of our assets across the portfolio. But a good pack of assets. Likely a demerger within the next couple of years. We think that\u2019s the right decision for Anglo American.",
         "In terms of our broader portfolio and its positioning in the world that we\u2019re looking at in terms of the future, we\u2019re certainly positioned to contribute to an environmental-led new materials demand. We\u2019ve seen the early evolution of electric vehicles and some of the challenges of energy storage. Now we\u2019re seeing widespread investment plans in hydrogen, first in China and demand in the automotive sector. We\u2019re seeing, obviously, buses in Britain using hydrogen. And now in Europe, we\u2019re seeing a much broader application and pull for hydrogen products.",
         "We\u2019ve been central to the promotion of hydrogen as the new fuel source. We\u2019re a founding member of the Hydrogen Council. And certainly from our point of view, and our involvement in PGMs, gives us a vested interest in making sure that we help support growth in the industry.",
         "For us, you\u2019ll be aware that we\u2019re looking at introducing a solar array in South Africa to generate, or use renewables to generate primary energy, but we\u2019ll oversell, oversize those units and generate hydrogen so we can start converting the major truck fleets to hydrogen consumption as well.",
         "So from our perspective, it\u2019s a great place to be. And most importantly, over the same period and with a greater use of renewables, we also improve our cost structures by reducing energy consumption by 30% by 2030, which is also part of, and one of the most important drivers of our cost-reduction strategy as well. So one plus one gets three, in terms of what we think hydrogen and other new developments will contribute in terms of our world.",
         "On Slide 23, you\u2019ll see our conversation around having an active route to a greener world and from our point of view, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going as a business. This approach fits with our commitment towards the environment and minimizing our direct impact and footprint in terms of the communities around us.",
         "We\u2019ve committed to making the business carbon neutral by 2040 earlier than most, and that by 2030, we\u2019ll have at least 8 operations that will be carbon neutral. Again, it will be a combination of solar, wind and other renewable sources connected to hydrogen and also battery power so that we create closed-loop systems. And the pathway is very clear. The detailed design is still in the works, but we\u2019re also starting to move on the pilots that we\u2019re looking at developing to demonstrate those pathways. And the platinum business will be one of the first places that we develop. And in fact, we\u2019ll have our first off-highway truck on hydrogen during the course of this year.",
         "Our new technology and innovation work is also central to this footprint. That 30% energy reduction includes implementation of bulk sorting, coarse particle flotation, bulks orders. We\u2019ve got in 3 operations already through copper, PGMs and nickel. We\u2019ve also got coarse particle flotation units being built in the copper business in Chile as we speak. And again, as we go further down line, looking at reducing our water consumption by 50%. And so really changing the nature of the operations, the footprint for the operations, and we hope, creating a model for the industry that will drive us all towards a much greener future and a much more significant contribution to a green future for the planet.",
         "On Slide 24, we talk to the numbers in a very simple way. We\u2019re building and evolving a high-quality mix of assets that are suited to future demand and we expect to see improving margins as a consequence of those switch. So a consumer world, an electrified world, a greener world. And from our point of view, our cleaner, greener world products will make up 65% of our portfolio over the next few years. And certainly, from our point of view, even with our contribution in Bulks, we\u2019ll have high quality, highly efficient iron ore and met coal, which will make, again, another efficiency and cleaner contribution to the making of steel over the longer term.",
         "On Page 25, we talk to delivery. Like all journeys to a much better place, the road is always not a smooth, or is not as always smooth as you\u2019d like, but there is no doubt in our progress and our continuing commitment to outpace our competitors in growth and continuing business improvement. As we have along the journey, we will keep learning and getting better. And we continue to measure success in sustainability through 3 primary lenses: first, effectiveness. Over the long term, we believe those companies that can generate better than 10% free cash flow will provide the ability to pay dividends and grow their business. And I\u2019m not talking about the next 2 or 3 years, we\u2019re talking about the next 10 to 20 years.",
         "That\u2019s the business we\u2019re building. And as we broaden the contribution across our portfolio, you\u2019ve got a portfolio set for long-term performance. Measuring the efficiency in how we generate those cash returns is just as critical for shareholders. And so our return on capital employed targets make sure that we keep our eye on capital discipline and that we don\u2019t throw money at simply generating cash and at the same time, destroying value. And being sustainable is absolutely key. So we have our 7 performance pillars: safety; environment; social performance; talent pool, making sure we\u2019ve got the right people; production and resource base, and the life of assets we have in the portfolio; unit cost position, we continue to improve against our competitors; and ultimately, it\u2019s about having a conservative balance sheet that allows us to do the right things and continue to make sensible investments for the long term.",
         "And so with that, as a differentiated company in terms of assets, capabilities and the ability to deliver long-term returns, that\u2019s Anglo American, I\u2019m very happy to take questions."
      ],
      "Stephen Pearce": [
         "Great. Thanks, Mark. And thanks, Mark, and good morning. As Mark said, the business has been robust through a volatile few months. The strength of the balance sheet as we entered the period has served us really well, and I\u2019ll touch a little bit later on how we expect the balance sheet to respond from here.",
         "While I\u2019m on the balance sheet, really pleased to see the lifting of the South African exchange control restrictions that was also announced back in February. We\u2019ve managed costs tightly through the period, but sustainably, it\u2019s helped underpin our earnings. We\u2019ve been able to exercise a degree of flexibility in CapEx to help protect our cash flows where needed. But importantly, we\u2019ve done all of this in a really sustainable way, fully funding our stay-in-business capital and not compromising our growth projects.",
         "So looking at the numbers, it was always going to be a volatile period, but they reflect all of the hard work across the whole Anglo American team. An EBITDA of $3.4 billion, despite an 11% impact on production. And that\u2019s really benefited from the transformation process that we\u2019ve been through for the last seven years. It\u2019s really given us a solid operational base.",
         "EPS at $0.72 a share and off the back of that, a $0.28 dividend based on our 40% payout policy. Unit costs, down 4%, with some help from FX. But remember, that is off a lower production volume. So some really good performance at an important time for us. CapEx $1.8 billion. And I\u2019ll talk to cash flow and working capital a little bit later.",
         "So moving to Slide 12. Looking at the breakdown of the $3.4 billion across the business unit. As you would expect, very limited earnings from diamonds, given the extent of the lockdown right across the whole diamond value chain. And just to remind you, we did give flexibility to our customers, particularly through Q2.",
         "Really good performance from copper, as Mark touched on, in an environment where we had slightly softer prices. Some challenges at Los Bronces with water. But production back on track and traveling very strongly with C1 cash cost of $1.07 a pound.",
         "PGM is obviously heavily affected by the converter plant outage but strong earnings, when you consider this really closer to one quarter sale rather than two. And again, full complements to the marketing team who managed to juggle those production challenges, sourcing material in a tight market and meeting our customers\u2019 demand with all of the uncertainty that they were also going through.",
         "Bulks benefiting from the great work at Minas-Rio, good recovery at Kumba post the lockdowns and definitely helped by the stronger iron ore price. In the Bulks, partly offset by lower prices of met coal and the operational issues that Mark has spoken to.",
         "So if we turn to Slide 13 and the drivers of EBITDA. Firstly, price. Some ups and downs across met coal, thermal coal and copper that I\u2019ve spoken to. But broadly offset by the benefit that we see in the weaker producer currencies. The impact of COVID, approximately US$1.1 billion, largely from consumer demand affecting diamonds and the South African lockdowns that we had through that March-April period at Kumba, PGMs and thermal coal.",
         "We took a considered and staged approach at each site. We felt it was appropriate, also considering the community and country aspects, always with health and safety as our number 1 priority.",
         "The outage of ACP at PGMs reduced EBITDA by $0.6 billion and together with $0.4 billion in relation to the disruptions at met coal. So putting all of those things aside, the rest of the business actually performed quite well, led by copper and Minas-Rio, in particular. Hence, the $0.4 billion improvement driven by those 2 sites.",
         "Turning to Slide 14 on the balance sheet. We, as I said, we entered the start of the period, a very, very strong position. Net debt to EBITDA of 0.5 times at the start of the period. And there was 2 primary factors across the 6 months that saw net debt increase. So firstly, the allocation of capital towards growth, $0.4 billion at Quellaveco and $0.7 billion with the acquisition of a crop nutrients business as we acquired Sirius. Secondly, we had a $1.4 billion buildup of working capital across the half. Diamonds at $0.5 billion and PGMs also at $0.5 billion.",
         "We had some shorter-term weather impacts just towards the end of June at copper in Kumba. So we do expect working capital should run down through the second half. So Diamond is probably more over a 6 to 12 month period, depending on markets. PGM is fairly substantially over the next 6 to 9 months. And the copper and Kumba miner bill should clear in Q3. Also, helpfully, from a balance sheet perspective, the lifting of South African exchange controls, and that\u2019s now in the process of being implemented and developed. A really pleasing development. ",
         "As I\u2019ve said previously, the currency controls that used to exist didn\u2019t have a major practical or a significant impact on us. But we do welcome the simplicity in capital structure and the move towards a more typical OECD regime. I think it also sends a really strong positive message about the country\u2019s desire to promote investment and growth.",
         "So as a result, net debt of $7.6 billion, that\u2019s around 1.1x EBITDA, well within our guided range. Now obviously, as we look forward, all subject to the normal caveats, particularly around prices, exchange rates and any impact from COVID, but we would generally expect that number to trend downwards from here towards year-end.",
         "Turning to CapEx on Slide 15. We\u2019re staying with our revised guidance, down by $1 billion to $4 billion, to $4.5 billion. And that does include the $300 million of year 1 spend at the Woodsmith project following the Sirius acquisition.",
         "The decrease in capital driven from a number of factors: weaker local exchange rates; some flexibility in the timing of our critical projects; and obviously, staying focused on our staying business capital spend. That reduction does include $300 million reduction in Quellaveco, and Mark will touch on that a little bit later. But importantly, because of the strength of the balance sheet, we\u2019ve been able to make every decision for every asset for the right health and safety reason and for the right long-term economic outcome. At the same time, our Brownfield projects, the diamond vessel in Namibia and Aquila in met coal remain on track and on budget. And you would have seen our recent announcement of a life extension project at Kumba at the Kolomela mine site.",
         "So clearly, on Slide 16, we remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation. And so to the scorecard for the half. Over the last 6 months, we maintained our base dividend, $600 million for the final dividend from 2019. And we allocated capital to some discretionary options. So growth capital in total, $0.8 billion for Sirius acquisition and $6 billion on our other growth projects. And we also saw the finalization of the additional shareholder return. So $200 million from the share buyback program.",
         "So stepping back on Slide 17. Yes, a volatile few months, but we\u2019re well placed, and it still remains about balance. We reinstated the dividend in \u201817, and since then, we have returned $5 billion to shareholders. We remain committed to our balance sheet target of no more than 1.5x net debt to EBITDA through the cycle. All of that underpins our growth profile. Our P101 and technology development and the marketing focus on margins allows us to invest sensibly across the business. And that, in turn, will drive our growth in production, EBITDA and cash flow.",
         "Quellaveco project in Peru, the Brownfield\u2019s project, should deliver a combined 20% to 25% production growth by 2023. In copper equivalent terms, that\u2019s really market leading. We believe our long-term EBITDA margins from the mining business can reach that 45% level based on long-term consensus commodity prices. So a real commitment to get the balance right. In terms of balance sheet, returns to shareholders, importantly, relationships with stakeholders and the discretionary allocation of surplus cash flows.",

            "Yes, certainly. So in terms of the current year, Mark, the $1 billion reduction, probably about 0.4 of FX impact across the total spend, about $300 million in terms of Quellaveco. So they\u2019re probably the two which is biggest items. Now clearly, Quellaveco will shuffle across \u201821 and \u201822. We haven\u2019t updated that guidance yet across \u201821 and \u201822.",
            "Now we will do that probably at our December update call. So we\u2019ll work our way through that and really understand how we\u2019re progressing through the second half, which will feed into \u201821 and 22\u2019s guidance. Mark, back to you."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I think you\u2019ve also got to remember, Liam, that with the lower production, you will naturally see lower sustaining capital through the course of the year. We\u2019ve also done some efficiency work. So when you get those numbers, they balance out pretty well.",
            "On the carbon neutrality approach, I think, firstly, a comment on pathways. You\u2019ll see in Brazil, where we\u2019ve signed long-term contracts with renewable energy suppliers, doing similar work in Chile. We\u2019ve got lots of sun in Chile. We\u2019ve got lots of sun in South Africa and in Queensland.",
            "So we want to use solar energy as much as we can. The idea of then oversizing, converting to hydrogen, creating closed loops with battery technologies as well, is pretty well been thought through. And you\u2019ve got to remember, we\u2019re also looking at dropping our energy consumption through the efficiency work that we\u2019re doing at a technical level.",
            "So I think there\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019ve got a complete solution pretty well thought through, and I think that\u2019s what puts us ahead, Liam. In terms of the 2040 target, again, we think we\u2019re on a good track to get there. We haven\u2019t relied on offsets to actually get to those numbers because of all of the work we\u2019re doing on the front end. I mean, we\u2019ve been putting the right people on the ground, working all of these solutions out to come up with the position we\u2019ve taken.",
            "Certainly, that leaves us with the ability to look at offsets, if needed. But we really want to drive the business to make a better contribution. In my view, offsets are sort of cheating a little bit in that you\u2019re using someone else\u2019s credits to cover your own ability or inability to get to zero.",
            "So the focus for Anglo American is to get there under our own steam, if you pardon the pun. But at the same time, if we need to do a little bit on the offset side, we\u2019ll obviously keep that option open.",
            "And don\u2019t forget with crop nutrients, the idea of improving agricultural production means the world is going to have to use less land for agriculture to actually hit its carbon neutral targets. And so from our point of view, crop nutrients is a significant contributor to what difference we can make and given we\u2019ve got such a small carbon footprint. So we\u2019ve thought it through pretty well to get to those numbers."

            "Okay. If I could just, a very quick follow-up. Just, I mean, it\u2019s clear on the carbon offsets. What we see from some of the agri-minium companies is they use life cycle offsets. So given some of your commodities, PGM, for example, are used in emissions abatement. Are you going to use those sort of offsets in terms of your targets? Or is 2040, that zero emissions at the operations?"

Look, if at the end of the day, we need offsets in terms of land and those sorts of things, we will consider them. But it\u2019s not our focus. It\u2019s around improving energy efficiency, which improves our cost structures. It\u2019s about looking at developing closed loop systems that allows us to operate in a clean way.

And I think some people even used the word swagger. And more recently, unfortunately, we\u2019ve had some fairly serious operational incidents at both Amplat and in met coal. ",

So I\u2019m just wondering, can you give us some color on the operational shortcomings that contributed to these incidents? And specifically, I\u2019m interested to know how you might be adjusting your operating model or at least the implementation of the operating model to address these incidents?"

            "Yes. Jason, a very fair question. I\u2019m not sure that we had a swagger. We don\u2019t certainly believe we\u2019ve got a swagger. In our view, we\u2019re about 50% of the way through the implementation of the detail in the operating model. Where we start is what we call work management, which is about how we get work done, how we plan work and making sure we\u2019re delivering as per plan. And that\u2019s been the driver between safety improvement, the 90-odd percent, the environmental improvement, the 90%, the health improvement, 90%. And that work has gone well. We call that work management.",
            "In terms of operating strategy and the detailed technical design work, there\u2019s been a lot of good work there, but we\u2019re probably still only 50% of the way up to where we want to be. And that includes the change in the control systems we\u2019ve got. For example, in platinum. We\u2019ve still got a lot of stuff that\u2019s done manually. So there\u2019s a lot more automation required. And for example, Natascha has introduced 8 new both physical controls and procedural controls in the converter to make sure we don\u2019t have the same incident. So we\u2019re still working through.",
            "We\u2019re still learning. We\u2019re still a work-in-progress in many ways. To be specific, at Moranbah on the longwall, the area that we started the wall had a little bit different geology, but we applied a standard design. What we\u2019ve done now is said, look, any of those designs, and this goes right across the board or any of the major cutback designs, actually have to be signed off 1 level above. Because where you\u2019ve got a change in circumstance, you really do make sure you\u2019ve got all the issues covered. So I think that\u2019s an important change. And the new design configuration worked extremely well. We got away 3 weeks earlier and the operation has been going well.",
            "Now we\u2019ve been implementing digitalization technologies in the management of the longwall, and that\u2019s improved our productivity to more than doubled. But there\u2019s still more work to be done. The Grosvenor issue in, call it, a bit of a different issue. And I know a lot of technical people won\u2019t understand the issue. We don\u2019t think it was an operating issue in terms of the way we would handle things on a day-to-day basis. What appears as though we\u2019ve had a major fall in the waste area, which all operations have, where you do have some accumulation of gas, where everybody has it. And it\u2019s actually flushed, that gas onto the longwall face.",
            "The question is what may have ignited the gas? And that\u2019s where the investigation work now is going on. And we\u2019ll find that solution. And I think, ultimately, that will require changes across the industry in the way some of these technologies work. But again, I\u2019m going to let the investigation finish its work. But I think there\u2019ll be some changes in the industry. In terms of the ACP, again, there were some procedural issues and there were some control issues. I think Natascha is right on that. And to those that I\u2019ve been talking to in the last few months, my, I\u2019ve explained the selection of Natascha in terms of her background in making sure we improve the operation, stability and consistency out of platinum.",
            "And even though we\u2019ve had massive change in the portfolio, our consistency hasn\u2019t been as good as it could be. And that\u2019s where the focus is. So I\u2019d like to say that the 90% improvement that we\u2019ve seen across all the dimensions indicates that we\u2019ve gone somewhere very different to where we are. But we\u2019ve still got a way to go. We\u2019re still not as good as we would like to be, and we\u2019re still not at 0 incident.",
            "So we\u2019ll learn, we\u2019ll apply the lessons, and we\u2019ll keep getting better as we should. Good question."

I guess, if we were to roll forward that slide into the second half of 2020, how would you expect the working capital bucket to change across the 3 different groups of PGMs and then the other items and more importantly, diamonds as well? And would you, is it conceivable for diamonds to repeat the working capital build that we have seen in H1 during the second half? That\u2019s my first question."

What portion of that is FX and oil? And what portion is retainable or sustainable cost savings that we should expect to roll forward into next year?"

            "Okay. Mark, I\u2019ll deal with the first one, and I\u2019ll make some opening comments on the second and then maybe throw it to you. So in terms of working capital, if you look at the sort of three primary areas, diamonds -- as Mark said, will clearly be market dependent. And it\u2019s hard to pick a month, but we\u2019re confident the market will come back and demand will flow through quite strongly when it does come back.",
            "So without picking the month, whether it happens in November, December or January, February, I\u2019m not too bothered by it. It\u2019s really about market coming back, and I know the team are looking at how they can sell diamonds in a different way given the circumstances. So they\u2019re working hard on that one.",
            "On PGMs, given that we\u2019re now back up and running at the ACP and the materials flowing out, I\u2019d expect that to come back quite strongly over the next six to nine months. And so you should see -- it may not be all of it, but a substantial portion of that $0.5 billion reverse between now and probably the end of Q1 in 2021.",
            "And copper and Kumba really was just about swells or capacity at the port in Kumba\u2019s case. So I think that should close itself out back through Q3. So all things being equal, I\u2019d love to think potentially, you\u2019re at least $0.5 billion, maybe a bit extra flushing out of that through the second half. But it is, with all the qualifications that you would expect in terms of prices of markets and further interruptions by COVID.",
            "But that\u2019s probably about the best guidance I can give you. It\u2019s more around timing than absolute amounts. In terms of -- just maybe your first comment on our cost guidance, I mean, clearly, some of the businesses have been impacted by the disruptions, and some of that\u2019s flowing through into cost structure. Met coal is probably a good example where that\u2019s flowing through quite directly into unit costs. And probably the currency hasn\u2019t helped in that case as the Aussie dollar strengthened against the U.S.",
            "In the other markets, yes, copper is probably the standout. Yes, we\u2019ve seen quite a -- I don\u2019t know what the percentage would be, 20% movement in currencies through copper producing regions and that\u2019s clearly helped. And just looking across the others, again, there\u2019s no real comment there, given the limited sales through Brazil. Yes, again, we\u2019ve had some currency movement that\u2019s helped. It\u2019s probably more in the sort of 10% to 15% range.",
            "So where we\u2019ve produced well, you\u2019ve seen sustainable cost out. And, yes, that\u2019s been helped by foreign currency. There\u2019s no denying that. But you also have seen price movements. And so on Slide 13, I think you can see that those two things have largely offset one another between currency CPI and price movements. And so there\u2019s a bit of give and take across each of those.",
            "So rather than just focusing on cost, as I often do, I\u2019d also ask you to focus on the price movement as well. Mark, any comments from you on that?"

      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Look, again, another good question. I think the way I\u2019d characterize where we are, firstly, on average, the assets that we have in the portfolio -- and these are the same assets, so I\u2019m not talking about the portfolio change, I\u2019m talking about the assets that we\u2019re operating, are on average doing 30% more in terms of production. And in terms of their actual performance, that group of assets is doing at least 20%. I think it\u2019s about 23%, 24% better on unit costs. ",
            "So we\u2019re at another level of performance. And it\u2019s interesting our actual underlying performance is actually even better than that, but we\u2019re having a little less consistency because we\u2019re at a higher level of performance.",
            "Now people know there\u2019s a few of us in the business that are pretty forensic in the way we pull stuff apart and understand what\u2019s going wrong and what we need to do to get right. So we\u2019ve obviously looked at the issues in coal and the ACP issue. But it\u2019s actually a much broader view. And we\u2019re looking at how we can improve the stability to take another 5% to 10% step on the operating cost side. And the two go hand-in-hand.",
            "So on the big improvements, we\u2019re continuing to make, we\u2019re giving about 60% back to inconsistency, and I\u2019m talking about the last 12 months. So we\u2019re just working really hard with the teams to get the stability. And so on the basis of the first half, and Stephen stripped away COVID and other movements, we had about a $400 million improvement outside of platinum and met coal. There\u2019s about a 4, 3% to 4% underlying cost improvement in the business if we can get that stability across the business that we\u2019ll take into the new year. So that\u2019s what Tony is focusing on with the operating teams, is to get the stability.",
            "We\u2019re working at another level in terms of risks and automation. That work\u2019s ongoing with the digital work. So I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019re taking 3% to 5% improvement that you\u2019re seeing some of it in the underlying performances into next year. But that\u2019s 1 we\u2019ll talk about at the end of the year once we\u2019ve seen how far we\u2019ve come along in terms of improving our stabilities. But the 1 thing I have to say, being in Anglo American is about constant improvement. ",

            "And then maybe secondly, on met coal. Are your views changing around met coal given the moves to decarbonized deal in Europe? Is the future looking grimmer for met coal? And then maybe with De Beers as well, what sort of cost savings you expect from this business transformation? And where do you think prices will rebase once the market comes back?"

            "Firstly, on the thermal coal transfer, certainly from South Africa, the response from the government has been very positive and constructive. So if we ultimately go down the demerger proposal, and that\u2019s the most likely route, we\u2019ll certainly, I think, do that in better than 2 years. Cerrejon, people know where we stand on Cerrejon. We will exit at some point. But we are also being very respectful of our two partners in terms of our processes. We maintain a dialogue. And at some point in the next 2 or 3 years, I think we\u2019ll be gone from there as well. Again, I don\u2019t want to be or can\u2019t be too hard on the timing of that. Because, again, we\u2019ve got 2 other, I was going to say, customers, 2 other competitors and 2 other colleagues that we have in that asset, we\u2019re making sure that we deal with that the right way. But again, we should be out of both in that time frame. Certainly, the South African change will be much quicker.",
            "In terms of met coal, look, the carbon issue is obviously a question. But I think most investors are a little more sophisticated than people give them credit for. They understand that steel is absolutely critical. And that you need met coal in the mix, and it will take time to make the changes. But there\u2019s no doubt that in terms of capital allocation, we keep an eye on when those changes and how those trends will change. We do for iron ore as well. Because we will see more recycling by 2035.",
            "We think steel will make, steel recycling will make up 50% of the mix. We think iron ore starts to change shape by 2025. So with both iron ore and met coal, we\u2019ll keep an eye on capital allocation. We\u2019ll tend to operate and run to pull a bit more cash. And our new investments will go into those commodities or products that we think are longer term, the big game changers. And that\u2019s why we think we\u2019re very different to our competitors, we\u2019ve got a much longer view. We\u2019ve got a portfolio that\u2019s set up for the future. And certainly, we\u2019re making sure people are very clear that we\u2019re building this business for long-term performance.",
            "In terms of De Beers, being consistent on the different product side, in the last 10 years, De Beers have delivered around 10% sustainable free cash flow. So that\u2019s before it\u2019s growth CapEx. We\u2019re currently operating at about 27 million, 28 million carats. We can actually take that up to about 37 million, 38 million carats, if the market is strong. We expect supply to drop away, 15% to 20% in the next 2 or 3 years. You know about Argyle, and there are other changes in the market that are recurring.",
            "So structurally, we think the business is in good shape. We are, when you look at it, running the best diamond business in the world, and it has been for 90 years. So there\u2019s no reason for us to think differently about that. We think prices will likely be stronger on the basis of supply falling away. There hasn\u2019t been a major discovery for 10 years. But in terms of what Bruce is doing, the rest of the business has made significant improvement in our cost structures. De Beers has made improvements, but it hasn\u2019t come as far down that cost curve, but also, it has to think about the midstream, downstream and its marketing investment.",
            "So Bruce is thinking right across the value chain, looking at improving its cost and looking at how we continue to evolve the business for the long term. And I know 1 or 2 old timers from De Beers say that it\u2019s not like it used to be. Well, it can\u2019t be. We\u2019re not about shaping this business for the last 20 years, we\u2019re about shaping this business for the next 20 years. And so Bruce has worked that we\u2019ll talk about in the next little while because, obviously, we have to take all our employees through it, is about improving our costs. It\u2019s about making sure structurally the business is set for the long term, and it\u2019s about making sure that we\u2019re the key supplier getting the right price for a rare product that\u2019s becoming rarer. And certainly, we think it\u2019s positioned for the long term."

I wanted to get a bit more insight into what do you think the cost and CapEx over the time or in the near-term will be to achieve your GHG reduction target, energy efficiency, et cetera, by 2030, I guess, initially, and then ultimately, carbon neutral by 2040. Have you done much work on that sort of margin abatement curves and what implies sort of carbon price you need to achieve that in terms of cost parity?",
            "And then the second question, just on what you mentioned in the earlier answer, Mark, about your views on met coal and iron ore sort of changing market dynamics. Does that make your view about -- you said capital allocation decisions will change, but I\u2019m curious what your views would be then on a Moranbah-Grosvenor debottlenecking? And also curious just your thoughts on this cut stable project approval, given that sort of view you\u2019ve just given on capital allocation?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Okay. Again, a lot in that, Ian. Let me pick up the issue of carbon cost. What you\u2019ll find in the Kapstevel approval, Timber and the guys have actually used carbon costs. And we\u2019ve costed that in the proposal against the South African carbon costs. Look, I\u2019ve seen carbon cost estimates ranging from $20 a ton to $100 a ton. I still think that\u2019s a moving feast.",
            "We look at all the scenarios and try and work out what we think it\u2019s worth. But if I just looked at the diesel -- current diesel costs, capital costs and operating costs, in looking at the solar array that we\u2019re looking at for Mogalakwena, oversizing, providing our primary power source to the plant, and then using excess capacity to generate hydrogen in a closed-loop system and then running our trucks, and it\u2019s -- the truck that we\u2019re looking at is a fuel cell battery hybrid -- it will be the first off-highway truck in the world designed by the Anglo American people.",
            "We\u2019ve had some people supporting us, but our teams actually designed it. We believe the fuel cost on the total cost basis will be actually lower than what it costs us to run that system with energy off the SA grid and diesel fuel imported at global prices. ",
            "We\u2019re not going to talk capital numbers yet. We will start actually explaining those numbers when we start presenting our sustainability strategies and when we talk to the detail on Mogalakwena. So we\u2019ll start unpacking the detail towards year-end and as we go forward. Stephen, I see your hand up. You\u2019d like to say something?"

      "26": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Thanks, Mark. And you mentioned in your opening comments about some of the renewable power and energy contracts we\u2019ve got in Brazil and Chile, as an example. They are, in fact, and will be substantially cheaper than what we had in place previously. And I think you\u2019ll see more and more of that coming through as you get scale and volume in that sort of segment.",
            "A couple of other quick comments on that. Yes, a lot of the things that will help us get there are actually really good for our business anyway. So, yes, some of the technology improvements, the coarse particle flotation, et cetera, the way we crush is good for the business and good from an ESG perspective. So they\u2019re actually a really integrated spend that helped drive you down that course.",
            "And obviously, some of these contracts and developments would be a question of, well, who spends the capital and how do you pay for that over time, not all of those things will necessarily be us spending the capital, but us getting the benefit of the outcome of that.",
            "Maybe then just a couple of comments, and I\u2019ll throw it back to Mark on met coal. Again, capital allocation, we often do think in a 5, 7, 10 year world as we allocate capital. And so, yes, met coal, I think, will still be a major part of particularly high-grade met coal. A major part of the steel production for 15-plus years. So we\u2019re still well inside that in terms of capital allocation.",
            "The Moranbah-Grosvenor debottlenecking, no, that won\u2019t be impacted by that. The rapid payback and returns on that, it\u2019s really an expansion in efficiencies through the wash plant that will give us the additional volume and returns. And Kapstevel south, as Mark mentioned, took full account of carbon pricing, community expectations, water, all of those sorts of things in our consideration and also has a fairly rapid payback through a 5 to 7-year period. So again, well inside, and again, a high-grade product like we currently produce on Kumba.",

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Thanks, Stephen. That was a good summary. In, to sort of capture that in a final comment, we believe that the capital implications are not significant on the basis that there will be a combination of what we invest in and Stephen\u2019s point around third-party supply, and there are people that are providing different types of structures and deals where they can have shared installations that will reduce our upfront capital cost and are very competitive from an operating cost perspective. And we\u2019re in a number of those conversations. And we\u2019ve seen some of those already come through.",
            "And on the operating costs are actually then lower than what we\u2019ve got as infrastructure in place. So it works both ways. And as Stephen said, Moranbah-Grosvenor debottlenecking, obviously, we\u2019ll get through the investigations and understand the key issues on Grosvenor. It will change, I suspect, a few things the way we operate. But the debottlenecking is a pretty straightforward project. It\u2019s got a rapid payback as has Kapstevel and other types of projects. ",
            "So we\u2019ll continue to invest in the business, but you won\u2019t see big step outs in terms of substantial new projects. They\u2019re more likely to be in other parts of the business, if I could make it. It\u2019s a lean towards other parts of the business as opposed to a massive step out at this point in time. Because the prognosis is still good in met coal and iron ore, but prices will track down, we think, the opportunity to make better returns will shift into those areas over time."

It feels like it\u2019s really picking up steam there. I guess, presumably, any Mogalakwena expansion will be very high IRR.

But it\u2019s a competition for capital. We make judgments about what we think the markets will look like. So nothing less than you would expect. In terms of the PGM business, Mogalakwena has a few different types of options. We\u2019ve got the ability to expand the open cut. And with the new exploration work, we\u2019ve also got the ability to tee off with shallow declines into high-grade underground ore bodies that give us the ability to utilize our processing infrastructure more effectively. And those costs from those operations are very competitive, and in some cases, lower than the open cut operating costs.",
            "So as we\u2019ve done our exploration, we\u2019ve developed a whole new range of possibilities and options. And so where we should spend in the mine versus on the processing side is we\u2019re just trying to look at getting that balance right. We\u2019re also creating a lot of low-grade material out of Mogalakwena as well, which is very low-cost material, when you put it through the process. So we\u2019re getting those balances right to get the capital allocation right. So at the end of the year, we\u2019ll be talking about the preferred option for Mogalakwena. And it will likely be a bit more from the open cut future developments in underground, and there will be some processing configuration changes. And we\u2019ll try and utilize our facilities with more of our own feed because that will drive us further down the cost curve. So that\u2019s 1 example, Tyler. I could go through more, but I think you get the flavor of where we\u2019re going."

Where can we expect to see the most significant change? Is it in the upstream? The midstream?

            "Thanks, Dominic. Look, the sight, let me just talk in the broad. Firstly, from an operating perspective, and I use waning as an example, our shovel productivities have improved 40% to 50% and the team is on the trail and chasing some of our best-performing operations. So they\u2019ll continue to improve. And so we\u2019re taking those into account. The changes that are upper, the nicher productivities, our productivity is across all parts of the operation and looking at continuing to reduce our costs in those parts of the business. That\u2019s one.",
            "Our overheads, our administration has always got to look at tightening up and trimming those costs. We also want to invest more in diamonds and in our brands. Our brand\u2019s Forevermark have been growing much quicker than the rest of the industry, and it\u2019s very clear that you can get what we think is fair value for your products, if you\u2019ve got the right brand and people understand what you\u2019re trying to do with the product.",
            "And so our investment strategy around marketing is very important. Given the last two or three years, and the positive growth we\u2019ve seen in Forevermark, that\u2019s also a very important part of our strategy. So understanding right the way through to the consumers as well as the position with our customers. Now our Sightholder are our direct customers. They are part of the change. We are consulting them in the process. And so they will be part of the restructuring.",
            "Now to be fair to them, we would -- we think it\u2019s important to have those dialogues, but we are flagging. There\u2019s an important exercise that we\u2019ve got to go through in making sure that they understand who will get what, how we\u2019ll position those conversations. And I\u2019m not going to preempt what those conversations will look like. But again, the whole value chain has to keep evolving for the world that we have and how we\u2019re competing with other discretionary spend products.",

So yes, the immediate term is very, very strong, and we expect to see continuing volumes through the plant. And then we\u2019ll do the second step up to the 210 aiming to hit our \u201823 target in terms of volumes. It\u2019s a little bit lighter than that, but we\u2019d like to get there a bit quicker."

            "The guys have actually been doing very well. They\u2019ve been able to trade water and find new sources of water. So the forecast that we put on a full year basis was on the fact that we felt we\u2019d have a pretty dramatic drought and that we would only include those sources that we believe we can get to. The good news is we\u2019ve had lots of snow and rainfall, even to the extent that we\u2019re not able to mine on a few days because there\u2019s so much snow. So we\u2019re certainly in a good place. I think we\u2019re just under an average year rainfall at the moment. So that basically pushes back the water problem.",
            "And with Aaron and the guys and the work they\u2019re doing, I think as we go into \u201821, we\u2019re going to be in pretty good shape. We won\u2019t say anything more than that until we get to the end of the year because the season, and we hope the rainfall season is not finished. But I\u2019d have to say today, I\u2019m a lot happier than I was at the end of year results. So really pleased with the progress. And so we expect Los Bronces to make a strong contribution for the balance of the year."
