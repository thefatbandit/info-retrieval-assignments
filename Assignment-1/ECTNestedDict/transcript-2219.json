         "Well, good morning, everyone. And welcome to day two of the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Conference 2020. And thanks for joining us here as we progress through our medical device presentations here in the morning. In fact, pleasure to have this year, our first large cap presentation of day two, which is Stryker. And I've got multiple members of management team with me, including Kevin Lobo, CEO, Glenn Boehnlein, CFO; and Preston Wells, VP of IR. Kevin is going to do a couple of quick slides here with his traditional preamble, those should be loaded in your screen; you should have the slides. You can see both the disclaimer and the slides on your screen. He's going to run through those and then we're going to jump into Q&A.",
         "With that, Kevin, the floor is yours."
      ],
      "Kevin Lobo": [
         "Okay, great. Thank you, David. And I am going to go quite briskly through these slides and then obviously have Q&A with David. Let's start with slide 3, which is the mission and values. And we launched this about six years ago. It's been a unifying force in our company, and nor has it been more important than during a pandemic, where we were on the frontlines supporting all of our customers, but really a rallying force for all of Stryker, and it's really helped to shrink the company and collaborate more than ever. If you go to the next slide, slide 4, this is the recovery curve. So you've heard every type of letter imaginable for prognosticators on what this recovery curve would look like. I think if you look at this curve, it's pretty clear that it's a V, a very strong V shaped recovery, we're really pleased to see that progression consecutively following the month of April, May, June, July, and August also is an improvement over July.",
         "And so obviously the pace of that V will start to moderate as the recovery really accentuates, but a really terrific recovery curve and frankly, much faster than we were expecting ourselves a couple of months ago. If you go to slide 5, I think it's really important to highlight that we haven't stopped our innovation engine at Stryker. So I just have a few examples here. On the left, you see the Surpass Evolve, which is our flow diverting stent, the next-gen flow diverting stent for neurovascular. We're very excited about this. Here are a couple of pictures from the first cases in the United States. This was approved in Europe a couple years ago, and has had great success; very, very streamlined delivery system. And as you can see, it's the first one with 64 versus the 48, normally, with other flow diverting stent stance, so we're really excited to be on the market in the US, great initial feedback from the surgeon community.",
         "In the middle, you see the new bed, so I'm really pleased to announce effective today we are launching the new bed called ProCuity. It's been a long time coming. And we're very, very excited about this launch. It has a number of very exciting features including fall prevention. So it has a low height feature to go very, very, very low to the floor so patients can put their feet on the floor. It is completely wireless and has a whole range of other features and so we're in that sort of thing the early launch phase right now. And full launch will be up by the end of the year, but very exciting new launch for our medical division. ",
         "And then on the right hand side you see the Ambulatory Surgery Center. And here Stryker is extremely well positioned. We've been winning a lot of deals this year; we created a dedicated team to act as a quarterback for all surgery center deals; so you can see there are a large number of procedures done in surgery centers to shift the surgery center has started prior to the pandemic, and it will only accelerate with this pandemic. And we believe we're very, very well positioned with strength across all of these product categories as well as having capital equipment, disposable and implants.",
         "If you go to the next slide, we -- just this quarter celebrated our 1,000th Mako installation. And that's a picture of me, I was able to go down and attend that. You can see it just arrived and was going through its testing. So it's -- that's not in the actual operating room just yet. But very excited about the progress of Mako, as you heard, we had a terrific second quarter with Mako. That's continued into the third quarter with a very, very strong order book. So the lead that we have in robotics is clear. And it's continuing. And it's a really a global thing. We have over 28 countries now that have a Mako robot, and that growth will continue long into the future.",
         "And then turning now to the last slide that I have, just as the long-term commitments that we outlined a number of years ago; we are still affirming that these are the ongoing commitments that we imagine for our company. Now, obviously, this year is a bit of an anomaly year, we have also called out right medical as being a little bit higher than normal dilution. But these 30 to 50 basis points we expect to be able to get back on that train. And that would assume, let's say the smaller amount of dilution from normal acquisitions, right. It's a bit of an outlier. But we do feel with this recovery, that V shape that you saw on slide 4, that we're going to be sort of back to doing the Stryker offense that we had prior to the pandemic.",
         "So that'll close my prepared remarks and open the floor back to David."

            "Great, Kevin. Thanks. That was pretty quick. I appreciate it. Also appreciate you announcing your new technology launches at the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Conference. We wish more companies to do the same. It's exciting news on the bed launch, so thank you. So appreciate your comments on recoveries, I'm not going to sort of a bemoan that point too much. One of the dynamics, though different Stryker is because of your capital-oriented businesses. You've said when you're seeing recovery; you now just said we've seen that recovery to extend to the summer. That's great news. Some investors are concerned that because you have these capital businesses that your recovery by has been V shaped to start, it will look particularly like that in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter because the MedSurg business sort of moving around. So what would you say to those investors who are concerned about your pace of recovery to the back half and do you think Stryker could get back to some semblance of normalcy by the fourth quarter?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, so what I would say is we have pretty good visibility on capital equipment through the end of this year, so our order book, we track orders, and obviously on large capital, the order timing is a little longer than smaller capital. But we have actually pretty good visibility through the end of this year. And right now, our order books are very healthy, across large capital as well as small capital. And so what we saw in the financial meltdown, if you think back to them, we saw the order book completely fall off. And the fact that the order book is healthy gives us confidence that this recovery will be sustained, at least through the end of the year, and I can't predict next year, right. Obviously, as the year unfolds, we'll have greater visibility into 2021. But certainly through the end of this year, we feel very good about and I do believe in the United States, which obviously is our biggest market. The stimulus funding has been a big source of strength for the hospitals, which have enabled them to continue to acquire capital at a good rate."

            "Okay, I want to come back a little bit to MedSurg, Kevin. But I know Glenn is on mute, but I want to ask Glenn a quick question here because you went there with Kevin. If I think about 2021, Glenn I know that guidance this year, we're not going to get it for next year. But Kevin just made a comment about getting back to that sort of 30 to 50 bps of margin. I know we have right to contend within 2021. In my model has 2021 margins, I think, similar kind of right around 2019 margins. Is that a crazy way to think about it in 2021 margins be higher than 2019 margins?"

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I think to Kevin's comment, I think what we're assessing now in our business as we look at 2021 is we have a number of programs that have been ongoing to really deliver margin expansion. And I would say that all of those programs with the exception of our ERP program have continued through sort of this pandemic. And if anything, it's allowed some good focus in areas of shared services; in areas of direct spend. So I do expect that those will continue to drive savings. As I think about 2021, obviously, Wright Medical will be a call out relative to that op margin dilution. But I do think that we would look at maybe 2019 as the sort of the benchmark to expand off of. And we would look to drive the underlying business, somewhere between that 30 and 50, based on benchmarking with a 2019 number."

And then Kevin, similar question for you as relates to growth, obviously, part to do this in 2021 yet, but I have my 2021 revenue numbers kind of nine percentage above 2019, which obviously, I could argue that sort of conservative number, not conservative number. Any ways of thinking help us think about qualitatively what 2021 could look like over 2019 for growth perspective."

            "Yes, it's a bit early, David to really -- in January, we'll give you our guidance for 2021. But most of your models are never really crazy. Honestly, when I've looked at what you've modeled, I would say it's based on your assumptions that you do, and I've never felt that you sort of been an outlier, frankly on the conservative side or the aggressive side, so we're based on the recovery curve, if things continue as they are, we're expecting to have a pretty good 2021. But that's a big improviser, right? This pandemic is new. And let's see what happens in the future. But we're feeling pretty good about 2021."

      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, so let's think about the Stryker, stating the obvious, was the premium growing large cap-medical device company for several years and in fact, accelerated every single year under your tutelage here as CEO of the business. So people can ask you very simple question, can Stryker get back to the top tier grower that it always has been? And I want to focus on three core tenets that I've identified as what I think is most important. So number one is you and Boston Scientific and [Indiscernible] acquires a lot of M&A. You've said multiple times that the M&A muscle is something that's been developed and located under Stryker, you've done 100 deals. ",
            "So the question now is you're going to exit COVID, you went from the most flexible balance sheet in med tech, to one of the -- to a less flexible balance sheet kind of 3x net debt to EBITDA, a little lower. I think some are concerned that you cannot continue to do this kind of cadence in a world where for 18 to 24 months; you can't do the same kind of deals. And I think that M&A is driven kind of 50 to 100 bps of incremental growth. Should investors be concerned that said that M&A engine or rely on M&A in the next 18 months is going to be more challenging?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "DavidLewis"
      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, well, obviously, Wright Medical is a very big deal that we'll be doing. And we expect to close in early October. So that field brings tremendous growth with it by the way, so the Wright Medical was growing quite a bit faster than Stryker's overall growth rate. And so we're in the high growth space, but it does tie up capital; we will still do tuck-in deals, but they won't be, let's say, at the same size as the more recent years of our acquisitions, but we've gone through many years with a small number of tuck-in deals and that continue to fuel growth.",
            "But we also have existing growth engines that are very strong. I just mentioned neurovascular, with the flow diverting stent in the US just really being able to go after that market. We also have the large-bore catheters that are recently launched, including our Vecta 74 catheter, which is really receiving very favorable feedback. So we have good product flow there we have the new bed, and Mako continues to be a tremendous engine for growth. And then, of course, international has still been an area of great growth potential for Stryker, you saw the last two years, we had terrific growth in international. So we have the foundation for tremendous growth in our existing business with new products with geographical expansion. ",
            "And so I don't see any reason why we won't continue to be at the high end of med tech. But that's one of our commitments, and we had that going into the pandemic and nothing's really changed, our strategy is still solid. Our decentralized business unit focus is still solid. We've maintained high employee engagement throughout this pandemic with the recovery curve coming back; the fact that we won't necessarily be doing as a large deals as a NOVADAQ or K2M while we digest Wright. That's just very temporary and with our focus on cash flow, if we generate better cash flow, we'll be able to do even more deals. So we've not turned the funnel off. And don't forget, we are picking up a pretty grow the asset with right."

         "Remarks": [
            "On at that point, Kevin, $7.5 billion was deployed K2, Mobius and then Wright; some would have preferred that that $7.5 billion went somewhere else. But there's two ways you can go med tech; you can take share in your core markets, or just get into better markets. Why would you sit back the benefit of hindsight, that $7.5 billion deployed, you make your case on why that was the right $7.5 billion to spend?"

      },
      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, if you go back to our strategy, David, which we articulated seven years ago was category leadership, and really being strong in every single market. We had a number of areas where we were far from category leadership. We were far from category leadership in spine. We are far from category leadership in sports medicine, and foot and ankle and the last remaining big gap was upper extremities, specifically shoulder and moving into category leadership has been tremendous for us. It really makes us more relevant with our hospital customers. If you think about a surgery center that slide I showed you those roughly 20 specialties, we're going to be strong in every single one of those including shoulder with the addition of Wright Medical, so Wright Medical, yes, orthopedics is not as fast growing market as some of the other spaces in med tech, but upper extremity sure is, right? ",
            "Upper extremities and even lower extremities, extremity is the fastest growing segment within orthopedics and we're going to be the number one player in the upper extremities and the number one player in lower extremities; they also bring a nice biologics portfolio with them. So the fact that we're deploying -- when we did spine there were people I think, like you who weren't as crazy about us deploying capital within spine but that's shoring up spine is makes us a stronger overall company. It's the largest market in orthopedics, innovation is rewarded. And so we feel that this is -- this category leadership philosophy and strategy has been consistent and has been a winning formula and our spine business is certainly in a much healthier position than it was prior to the acquisition of K2M. And it really does help in the surgery center. ",
            "We provide everything they need across all those 20 specialties including Mako; including stretchers, Neptune waste management, power tools, we give them the capital, we give them, so we're very deep in the service lines and that's -- it's not a new strategy. So we've just continued to fulfill our strategy; just look at right as a large tuck-in, I mean it's a very large one but it is a tuck-in to really strengthen our category leadership philosophy and honestly we're a high growth company. You sort of look at a market and then you look at Stryker's growth. And if we-- with our winning formula, we can grow well above market rates and do it very sustainably. I think you've seen that; it's not a one year thing or a two year thing. And so even if a market may not be as attractive as another market, if it leverages our core strengths, and fits within our categories, we know we can win."

      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, that's very clear. Second key component and I'm going to focus on the business that is the most misunderstood business inside Stryker, which is MedSurg, right? It's a big capital business. It can't grow. You and I both know that business has grown about the corporate rate really for the last five to six years. Here we [Indiscernible] COVID. You just talked about your order book in your preamble, which sounded pretty healthy, frankly, there's still that persistent fear that this is a capital business, we're going through a challenging cycle. Why if I said investor, Stryker grew 6.5% in MedSurg last few years, take the over the under on that 6.5%; 99% investors are taking the over it's taken, taking the under, why are they wrong? Why are you so still confident that this portfolio can continue to grow in a challenging environment?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "DavidLewis"
      },
      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, so I think there are a few reasons why it's misunderstood. I think the first reason is there's sort of a memory of what MedSurg used to be, right? If you go back to the financial meltdown, the MedSurg business dropped like a rock, right? There's a liquidity crisis, which there isn't' this time, and it was much more tilted towards capital and large capital. And now if you look at the MedSurg portfolio, it's been very diversified. Over the past seven or eight years, we've added businesses like Sage like Physio-Control, like Invuity, all these instruments, little, little deals, they're much more disposables, much more consumables in our portfolio. So the mix of business and metric has changed very profoundly. ",
            "That's the first thing. Second thing is we've accelerated our innovation cycles. So the time between a camera launch; the time between a power tool launch, the time between launches has shortened. And we've gotten faster at continuing to innovate. If you keep innovating on a faster cycle, you can drive higher growth. And so this is done and we've also specialized so more and more specialization, drives growth and that's been a formula for Stryker, you saw just a year ago, we split our instrument Salesforce, and created two different parts of that Salesforce just within the surgical portion of instruments, and it drove terrific growth and part of that split though was doing the Invuity acquisition, doing the TSO3 acquisition; doing these little, little deals that create this engine of growth and, and it really both sides have grown. ",
            "So when you split a Salesforce sometimes you worry that you'll focus on a product that was more neglected, but the product that was the flagship would start to say and that hasn't been the case at Stryker. So we have this winning formula in MedSurg and we have very high market shares. So when we have this replacement cycle, we were able to renew this fairly, fairly easily. And so we love our position in MedSurg; it's kind of the -- it's been the reliable -- the most reliable portion of our business and if, when I joined Stryker, orthopedics was the largest segment of Stryker. MedSurg is now our largest segment, reporting segment. That's not an accident. We see great opportunity within MedSurg. And we have really great strong businesses. Our challenges, frankly been to grow MedSurg more outside the United States where we have very high, we over index in the US, and that's been part of the engine of growth in Europe has been getting MedSurg to really fly in Europe. So we still have a tremendous amount of growth outside the United States. But inside the United States, this formula that we have constant new cycle innovation, and specialized Salesforce and dedicated and tuck-ins, that's been a winning formula. And that'll continue."

            "Absolutely not crazy great at all. I think about something like sports medicine, that's been a tremendous growth for us and that sits inside of endoscopy. So we have some of these like hidden businesses that because they're small, they don't get as noticed, but that's -- those are all engines of growth."

      "18": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, that very clear. The only business in there as well as the medical business, some of your competitors there have been less bullish. You talked about the ICU bed market being having some structural drivers maybe outside the US. Is that medical business or just a bed business a significant concern or is it a small enough business inside Stryker where it's a manageable issue if there's some pull forward?"

      },
      "19": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Look, we look at medical. First of all, it's a big business for Stryker overall, there's beds, there is stretchers, then you also have the emergency care business, which is that you have the defibrillators, and you also have the powered cots that are in the ambulances. And we're still seeing tremendous demand for those through the pandemic, and we think that'll continue. And then you have Sage, which is, frankly, was hard hit in the second quarter, and that's going to come back as more and more procedures, there's higher census counts in hospitals. So we actually have a more diversified medical division than we used to have, when it was only beds and stretchers. And so now we feel pretty good about medical continuing to have strong performance. ",
            "What's unknown really is the second quarter we did have a bit of a spike in the ICU demand. How sustainable is that but for Stryker the ICU portion of the medical business is actually pretty small. And we're very excited about this new bed launch. And this has been a long time coming. And so I think that'll give us an extra spring in our step out that can also be converted to an ICU bed, if necessary, they designed to be able to be stepped up to an ICU bed. So it has that flexibility as well if let's say there's another pandemic or another outbreak, we do make special purpose ICU beds, but this bed has that functionality as well. So we feel very good about medical being able to continue to grow at healthy rates."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, very clear. The last 10 in fact, the most important has been your leadership in robotic orthopedics specifically with Mako and now of course, you have competition. So the fear is you cannot continue to grow market growth at the same rate as you were before. That being said, we've seen very substantial robotic placements during the pandemic, which must be some underlying driving demand. I'm curious in the last second quarter, how much that very significant placement activity was maybe a change in the selling models during the pandemic versus just good underlying demand in the US versus x-US?"

      },
      "21": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, I think it was good underlying demand was the main reason. I think now robotics is seen as necessary in orthopedics. So having competition has actually been for those accounts that were sort of waiting or thinking about it, and not sure, I think it provides a tailwind, but we're still in the early stages, I think we're starting to an inflection point on the S curve adoption rate, where we're going to see continued demand, third quarter is looking just as strong as the second quarter related to Mako. So it wasn't some kind of anomaly, that type of purchasing moving a little bit away from cash towards more financing. I think that's just related to concerns about liquidity. Because if you remember in the second quarter CARES funding hadn't really arrived yet at the hospitals, it was an uncertain amount that they were going to receive. So I think that shift I don't know if that's going to be permanent. ",
            "I think once hospitals sort of get back to more normal volumes and feeling better about their financial situations in the US tend to move to be more purchasers than financing. It did quiet outside the United States in the second quarter, but we're seeing that resume in the third quarter where the capitals makers are starting to be ordered in the outside the US market, so we're pretty bullish about the potential of robotics and I think competition has actually been healthy. Because we know we have a fantastic system and we have a leading system. And so we love our chances going competitively against any other system. But I think more importantly, there's room for everybody to grow when the markets at a low rate within robotics. ",
            "So we really are optimistic and bullish. And it exceeded our expectations; we actually felt that there was going to be a bit of a slowdown which didn't materialize. And part of it's been the flexibility of our model. But part of it's been a surgery centers; we are winning a lot of makers and surgery centers. And I think that there's been a shift and acceleration. It was already a trend that was as you know occurring, but I think that that trend is accelerating. And the fact that they want Makos in those surgery centers, the fact that you don't have to have lots of trays of instruments with Mako because they have a very small central -- their sterilization capabilities and surgery centers is very limited. This actually plays very well for the surgery center. And we can wrap it with all our other products and disposables and consumers."

      "22": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So a couple of things. I'll follow and ask how you made this Ambulatory Care Dynamics you've talked to now for about a year. It's not just about Mako; obviously it's also about other products you sell into that business as well, but the acceleration for ambulatory care or ASC for orthopedics, is that being more driven by COVID right now? Are we more driven by the reimbursement changes the last two years?"

         "Remarks": [
            "It's both. It's both. I think the two things; I can't parse it out between the two, David, but I think it was already happening and reimbursement was the biggest driver to the shift. Now the pandemic has added fuel to the fire. It's just mean patients feel safer there. It's just a more practical thing to do. So every hospital executive guys that I talked to is thinking about surgery centers and where the next surgery center is going to be. So I think the trend will absolutely accelerate. And we love the fact that we have this offense created with a quarterback that because the deals we're doing always involve multiple divisions, and they tend to be long-term deals. So that's really a source of -- it's really a tailwind for Stryker right now."

            "Yes. So I believe given your leadership position, you're going to continue to grow above your orthopedic market specifically in knees. The people who believe that the ROSA system is a defensive offering that sort of freezes Zimmer Biomet accounts and makes that makes it harder for you to sort of penetrate those accounts now. I think that's where the concern is coming from. What are those people missing? Are they missing that you're still under penetrated in the core implant side? Are they missing China? Are they missing Japan? I think that there's a lot of sensitivity that your relative rate of growth versus the market is going to slow. Not that you're going to grow fast than the market. I think everyone understands that."

            "Yes, I just look, there's -- it's a big market. We know we've grown our share very significantly, but our share is still like around 30% of the United States in knees. So there are still a lot of markets that we can go after even if competitors are successful with in retaining some of their business. There's still plenty of other business to go after. And yes, outside the United States, Japan is in the early phases, China; we still don't have approval for our total knee yet. But we're starting to place Makos around, hit the hip application and partial knee. India, we've started to, we've sold a few robots already in India, that's a potential future market. The big ones are China and Japan; those are going to be very, very big robotic markets. We have all the approvals in Japan, and hopefully soon, hope it's kind of put a delay, a little bit of a delay in the China total knee approval, but those are going to be very, very big markets for us. And we believe we have up the winning solution in robotics, and that's going to continue for a long time to come. And also cementless, I just had cementless. We index roughly 20 percentage points higher in accounts that are Mako accounts versus accounts that do their knees either navigated or manually. So that also we get a tailwind around cementless with every Mako that's placed as well."

            "Okay. And then one of the rationales for Wight, you already talked about a market leadership in a fast growing segment, but obviously there's an opportunity to taking other large joints and putting them on the system; you commented earlier this year in the midst of COVID or pre COVID, about CNET, seeing the technology, where are we on the kind of robotic shoulder? And how should we think about timing?"

So I can't give you a timeline. But I could tell you, I was down. I just happened to be down in Fort Lauderdale just before the pandemic hit and had a chance to look at the shoulder prototypes, and it is wildly exciting. And so obviously, we have to get the Wright Medical deal closed. And we're going to want to pair the Mako offering with their leading, market leading implants. And so that'll take a bit of time obviously, to do that, but very, very exciting because it's hard to do procedure and makers going to make it easy to do so. That to me is a really a game changer. And something that's very exciting. But I can't give you a timeline just yet. It's certainly not in 2021. It'll take a little longer than that."

            "Okay. What about spine? You made some acquisitions right before COVID. They were both about getting integrated navigation imaging robotic platform for spine. You've been a little behind, but you have all the components now. What about spine timeline? Is it -- it was sort of, it seemed to me as if that acquisition could accelerate your move into spine to the margin. Does the spine robotics come before shoulder robotics?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, in the spine, we have two options, right? So we have the option of doing something robotic with the Mobius. With the Mobius acquisition came this they had a Cardan Robotics unit that was working on robotics. So that's one option. And the other option is Mako for spine. And so the team is kind of going through that assessment phase and I don't want to predict exactly what we're going to do. But we have the option of using the Cardan which is we'll call it Mazor and Excelsior like, so it's more similar to Globus and what Medtronic has on the market today, that's what they were pursuing. Mako will be something different. That'll have the haptics and the cutting, it'll be a more advanced offering for spine, it's further out the Mako offering. It'll be more game changing and its application. But that timeline is probably a little further out. And we'll see whether the Cardan will be able to come to the market more quickly, but that's what the teams are working on. We have two different pathways there, David. And so I don't predict the timing. But with Mako I would say shoulder will probably come before spine. That's how it looks today. But that doesn't mean we won't have a robotic offering for spine because we do have that asset that was acquired within Mobius."

Obviously, the M&A concerning the balance sheet actually could, you've said exiting the high end in med tech, if this was a consistently a 7%, 8% type organic growth business and a normalized environment as you look at the portfolio now and you speak about the three areas that I was concerned about, do you still see the ability for this business to get back to that kind of 7% to 8% growth in a normalized environment, even considering some of these things we talked about this morning?"

            "Yes, I mean, we've seen over the past six, seven years, we consistently grow well north of 200 basis points faster than our underlying markets. That should continue. So if the market goes back to it's kind of 4% or 5% growth, and you should expect 7%, 8% per months, that's not an unreasonable expectation, but it does depend on what the market does, right? We can\u2019t - we are not going to defy gravity if the market is going 1% or 2%. We're not going to be growing 7%, 8% but the way things are covered -- that recovery curve, doesn't just apply to Stryker, right? So that V shaped recovery is the market improving, and you should expect to add that north of 200 basis points on top of the underlying market growth to our growth rate. That's our expectation and we don't see any reason with the offense that we have in place that, that won't continue."
