         "Thanks, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2020 conference call. With me for today\u2019s call is Saia\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Fritz Holzgrefe.",
         "Before we begin, you should know that during the call, we may make some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements and all other statements that might be made on this call that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release and our SEC filings for more information on the exact risk factors that could cause actual results to differ.",
         "With that said, I will now turn the call over to Fritz for some opening comments.",
         "Thanks, Fritz. Second quarter revenue was $418 million, down $46 million or 9.9% from last year. The revenue decline was driven by the 9.7% decline in shipment volume compared to the prior year.",
         "Fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 27.6% and was 10.6% of total revenue compared to 13.2% a year ago. While the reported yield was down 0.6%, the pricing environment remained stable and our yield ex-fuel surcharge was positive, as Fritz mentioned.",
         "Operating income of $35.7 million was 30.3% lower than last year and our operating ratio of 91.5% deteriorated by 250 basis points from the record OR of 89 we achieved in last year\u2019s second quarter. Compared to our record first quarter OR this year, the OR was only up 20 basis points sequentially, as Fritz pointed out.",
         "Moving now to key expense items in the quarter. Salaries, wages and benefits decreased 5.6% driven by our actions around COVID-19, including furloughs. These cost savings were somewhat offset by our 2019 July wage increase of approximately 3.5%, and the employee growth related to the nine new terminals we\u2019ve added since the beginning of the second quarter last year.",
         "Purchase transportation costs decreased 22.7% compared to last year. As a percent of total revenue, purchase transportation costs were 6.3% compared to 7.4% in the second quarter last year.",
         "Fuel expense fell by 38.8% in the quarter, while company miles decreased 6.3% year-over-year. National average diesel prices were approximately 22% lower throughout the quarter than a year ago.",
         "Claims and insurance expense rose by 39.1% in the quarter, reflecting increased accident severity in that expense line and higher premium cost versus the prior year. To put that in perspective, of the approximate $5 million expense variance to the prior year, $1 million was related to premium increases.",
         "Depreciation expense of $33.7 million in the quarter was 15.5% higher year-over-year. This is a continuation of the trend we\u2019ve seen over the past few years as we\u2019ve grown our terminal network, invest in equipment to lower the age of our tractor and trailer fleet and made meaningful investments in technology.",
         "Overall, operating expenses decreased by 7.4% in the quarter, combined with the revenue decline of 9.9%, our operating ratio again deteriorated by 250 basis points.",
         "Our tax rate for the second quarter was 18.3% compared to 25% last year. The decrease was primarily related to stock compensation impacts from director retirements. We expect our full year tax rate to be 22% to 23%.",
         "Second diluted earnings per share were $1.07 compared to $1.40 last year. For the first six months of 2020, we made capital investments totaling $142.7 million. And for the full year, we now anticipate net capital expenditures will be less than $250 million planned at the beginning of the year.",
         "Outside of our committed equipment purchases this year, we are continuing to take a very measured approach to all other capital spending. We believe our balance sheet is strong with $29.3 million in cash on hand and more than $300 million of availability through our revolving credit facility and additional outside borrowing sources.",
         "Before turning the call back to Fritz for closing remarks, I\u2019d like to provide a few details of the impact of COVID-19-related cost actions on our second quarter results. On April 1, we offered all full-time workers an additional five days of paid time off and one additional day for our part-time workers in light of COVID-19. The approximate cost of this action was $3.6 million in the quarter.",
         "Also, the $250 employee bonus in the quarter was an additional $2.6 million, an approximate cost, and more than $400,000 was spent in the quarter on PPE supplies. Some of these costs were offset by our temporary elimination of 401(k) matching in the quarter.",
         "With that said, I will now turn the call back over to Fritz for some closing comments."
      ],
      "Frederick Holzgrefe": [
         "Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss Saia\u2019s results. To start the call today, I would like to thank all Saia employees who continue to exhibit great professionalism and teamwork, while working productively through these difficult times.",
         "More than 90% of our employees are unable to work from home due to the nature of their jobs. Their willingness to adapt to new policies, procedures and safe practices has been remarkable.",
         "The unprecedented conditions brought on by COVID-19 pandemic have presented many challenges at home and at work, and I cannot be more gratified by the response and effort put forward by everyone here at Saia to adapt to the new normal.",
         "From the start, we\u2019ve focused our efforts on keeping employees and customers safe. Operational practices put in place in March and have been enhanced throughout the quarter to create a safe environment in our terminals and in our offices. Those policies remain in place today.",
         "We have consistent distribution of PPE supplies across our network, and any one of our employees who is able to work remotely is still encouraged to do so. Daily communication across our leadership team is taking place after the impact from COVID-19 trends from inside our company in the communities where we work can be assessed.",
         "We have many employees across the company who are volunteering daily in order to fill in for co-workers who may be out with COVID-19 concerns for family member or who are actually ill themselves.",
         "The already challenging environment has been further complicated as the impact and complexity of COVID-19\u2019s impact on the supply chain and economy has varied by city, region and even by customers. Freight patterns have changed in some cases on a daily basis as regions either reopened with restocking or imposed new restrictions that ultimately slow down. These variables along with the operating challenges that I\u2019ve described have tested our ability to calibrate in real time.",
         "We\u2019re able to adjust our cost structure in response to the declines we saw in April and subsequently support the improved trends that we saw in May and June. As far as a result, I was very pleased that we were in a position to be able to offer a one-time bonus of $250 per employee, paid in July to those employees who have worked through these trying times.",
         "Considering the incredibly challenging environment, I believe we have posted solid financial results. In the second quarter, revenue of $418 million was down only 9.9% after starting the quarter with revenue per - April revenue per workday down 13%.",
         "Second quarter operating income of $35.7 million was down 30% from a year ago, and our operating ratio deteriorated by 250 basis points to 91.5 compared to the record operating ratio in the second quarter last year of 89.",
         "It is worth noting that we only experienced a 20 basis point margin deterioration sequentially compared to our record first quarter 2020 result, in which we\u2019ve posted a 91.3 operating ratio.",
         "There are several components on the cost side, which Doug will cover in more detail in his comments. Fundamentally, re-calibrating our cost structure was critical to our performance.",
         "Despite our shipments being down 9.7% for the quarter and with industry volumes reportedly down even more, the pricing environment has remained rational in our view. While our yield, including fuel surcharge, was down 0.6%, excluding fuel surcharge, yield rose 2.6% and our negotiated contract renewals saw an average increase of 4.5%.",
         "With the combination of positive pricing and increase in weight per shipment of nearly 1% and an increase in length of haul of 4%, we saw revenue per shipment increased by 3.5%, excluding fuel surcharge revenue.",
         "Before I turn it over to Doug for a few - review of financial results, I\u2019d like to highlight a couple of operational achievements that are noteworthy given all of the changes made very quickly out in the field.",
         "Our cargo claims ratio improved to 0.65% from 0.76% a year ago. This is also the second quarter in a row where we saw sequential improvement. We\u2019re benefiting from our continuous training efforts, particularly with our newest associates in terminals opened within the past year.",
         "Productivity on our docks and in our city operations continued the strong trends for the first quarter and our production metrics improved on a year-over-year basis. Through our continued efforts aimed at network simplification, we also saw an improvement in both empty mile percentage and load average, despite the lower volumes experienced in the quarter and our expanded coverage area versus the prior year.",
         "With those highlights addressed, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug for a detailed review of second quarter results.",
         "Thanks, Doug. In closing, I will say that the primary driver of our steady quarter-to-quarter margins was the result of not only cost cutting, but also adjustments made to our operating model in the very early days of this pandemic.",
         "In a labor-intensive business like ours, it is critical that we match hours to workload, and our flexible non-union workforce was key in doing this effectively. Our terminal managers and frontline staff did an excellent job of executing on the plan.",
         "The difficulty in controlling hours and costs while making major changes to procedures cannot be understated. Virtually everything from our employees clocking into the terminal to dispatching drivers to making to pickup and delivery at customer locations had to be modified. Driver meetings, safety meetings, breakroom use, all of these procedures have historically been activities where our employees are together in a closed environment.",
         "We\u2019ve had to modify most all of our practices, and at every turn, our workforce has been united and really displayed the desire to take care of one another and do the right thing.",
         "In light of the near-term uncertainty around business levels, our focus will continue to be on health and safety and on execution of our strategy through these challenging times, and we\u2019ll look forward to better days ahead for all of us.",
         "With that said, we\u2019re now ready to open the line for questions, operator."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks. Good morning. Fritz, thanks for the clarification on the change in yield and giving us the number ex-fuel. You\u2019ve had very consistent track record of improving yields and obviously feel some impact here in the quarter.",
            "But how do you think about the yield environment going into the back half of the year? It sounds like contract renewals are still pretty consistent with where they were in the first quarter.",
            "Can contract pricing accelerate as tonnage improves or is it still an environment where it\u2019s a little bit difficult to go out and get more price right now with where the economy is?"

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "No, I mean, trends have been pretty steady there around pricing throughout all of this. I mean, the July the July trends, I would say or we\u2019d phrase it is probably solidly mid-single-digit. So I think the opportunity is still there. I mean, the mix of review each quarter on contracts varies. So it\u2019s hard to say from quarter-to-quarter.",
            "But generally, I mean, something in line with the GRI that everybody put in place earlier in the year still seems to be possible to achieve and we\u2019ve retained most of that GRI in line with historical levels, 75% or 80% of the GRI seem to stick so far.",
            "So I think - I don\u2019t see any reason that that wouldn\u2019t be the opportunity in the back half. Things have tightened up, but volume levels will have a lot to do with it as the year goes on."

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. I can go through the quarter. I didn\u2019t do it in the prepared remarks. So we\u2019ll just take it month-by-month. So in April, our shipments were down 16.2% and tonnage was down 12.9%. In May, shipments now 9.2% and tonnage was down 8.8%, and then in June, shipments down 4.1%, tonnage down 5.7%.",
            "So far in April or so far in July, shipments are actually up 1.9%. And the weight has been pretty volatile for the last couple of months, weights down in July. So tonnage is down 2%, but still an improvement continuing from what trend we had in place in Q2."

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And why do you think the weight per shipments down in July? Do you have any kind of - and I know that there has been some moving pieces kind of across the industry with weight per shipment. But just any thoughts on weight per shipment into July, the impact there?"

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "It\u2019s hard to say. I mean, we don\u2019t really see it in any particular industry vertical or region of the country. I think just maybe it\u2019s the fits, new starts with the reopening. Some customers more confident, perhaps in the plan to reopen, maybe putting bigger shipments through the system, while others maybe not or they\u2019re seeing parts of their business come back, so the shipments are smaller.",
            "But it\u2019s been hard to say. But there is some really good days and there are some days that weight is lower, and it\u2019s just been volatile. But all in all, I mean the shipments positive in July feels pretty good."

      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. Okay. Let me ask one more and then I\u2019ll turn it over. But what can you share with us about the operating ratio going forward? Obviously, very good, it was relatively consistent with 1Q. But a lot of moving parts with the furlough, the insurance expense and obviously the tonnage trend.",
            "So anything you can share with us directionally about how we should think about either incremental margins or the operating ratio into the back half of the year?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Todd Fowler"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. I feel like we\u2019re in a little better position to talk about sequential margins than we were March into April. Once trends bottomed and started improving, we feel a little bit better looking forward given that there is still uncertainty getting into the fall months.",
            "I would say, historically, if you go from Q2 to Q3, you usually see a deterioration of, call it, 75 basis points, 85 basis points. This year, we\u2019d - like you said, with all the moving pieces, we would hope to target 100 basis points of sequential improvement this time around. And if we did that, that would put us very close to the record OR we had last year in the third quarter.",
            "So I mean, that\u2019s - with two months left in the quarter and accident volatility always out there, that\u2019s our best guidance we could give you. We would target about 100 basis points better actually."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks, operator. Hi, Fritz. Hi, Doug. Hey, Doug, I was just hoping actually, it\u2019s a weird quarter, so I think it would be somewhat helpful to just kind of understand how June and July shipments are trending sequentially. It\u2019s a little bit of a nit-picky question, but it seems like you guys are winning some market share. And I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s giving you confidence or the opportunity to maybe raise pricing a little bit more given the demand environment that you guys seem to be seeing or the improvement in demand? You have obviously a big 3PL business, you have other types of business, wondering if you\u2019re seeing an opportunity to raise prices because of the market share that seemingly appears to be that you guys are winning?"

      },
      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So Amit, I would just jump in on that. I mean, I think the pricing opportunity continues for us and we\u2019re very diligent with that. I mean, there certainly is the more analytics that we can put into that, the better. We\u2019re driving those sort of pricing decisions.",
            "Particularly, when you think about the costs that we\u2019re adding as we manage through the pandemic scenario. So it\u2019s certainly that the -- we have to be very aware and cognizant of that and what the impacts are in the network. Now it\u2019s the opportunity that we\u2019ve long held with Saia and we look at the pricing opportunity versus the rest of the industry, that remains.",
            "And I think one of the important things, the takeaways from the second quarter is although we\u2019ve managed through some real challenges, it fundamentally - the thesis for Saia remains, right? So what are - what we see is the longer term opportunity, maybe in some cases it picks up, but we don\u2019t see a change to that. We did see it\u2019s an opportunity for us to continue to execute. Very pleased with the second quarter execution in light of what we were dealing with, and that pricing quite frankly falls into that category as well."

         "Speaker": "Douglas Col"
      },
      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And to the first part of your - Amit, to the first part of your question, I would say that really since early in May, each week, it seems like shipments per day we\u2019ve kind of seen a building trend. And not every week is up week-over-week, but I\u2019d say June to July is still a little bit better in terms of shipments per day.",
            "But that gives us confidence on the pricing side. If we\u2019re seeing that kind of volume come back and we\u2019ve - some terminals, it\u2019s hard to have enough labor each day with the COVID virus and all. So that gives us - puts us is in a pretty good position to push price.",
            "I mean, if we have a lot of congestion in the network and in some areas we need, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing to run off a little business if you try to push the price too hard or a little bit higher than you might otherwise. So the pricing opportunity is still good for us I think."

      },
      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the follow-up for me is, as you guys expanded in the Northeast, I mean, you\u2019ve got a lot of smaller kind of break facilities all over the place and you have an ability to kind of build direct loads that builds that network effect.",
            "And then one thing the LTL industry hasn\u2019t done well in the past is really capture, optimize accessorial charges. And there\u2019s companies out there that provide LTL companies kind of better visibility on being able to capture those accessorial charges.",
            "So I\u2019m just trying to understand like is that - where are your accessorial charges today? Is there opportunity to capture more of that money that basically drops directly to bottom line, if you can address those points as well?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Amit Mehrotra"
      },
      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. Amit, absolutely. And with that -- and what drives that really is understanding what the freight is, what the customer situation is, what the delivery looks like, what services we\u2019re providing, be it a lift gate or are we in a situation where maybe we\u2019re making a delivery that\u2019s an extended range beyond our terminal or into a high cost or complex area. All those things are part of making sure that we get our accessorial charges in it.",
            "You think about it two ways. On one hand, making sure you understand what your costs are. And when you understand that what the complexities are of customers\u2019 freight or where the delivery is, making sure you charge for that. Likewise, to the extent we\u2019re using any sort of specialized assets, we need to be charging for that as well.",
            "So it\u2019s an opportunity. It\u2019s a data-driven opportunity. It\u2019s about making sure we understand not only what\u2019s going on with the customer, but then kind of what is the impact on our operation."

            "Yeah. Sorry about that. Thanks very much for the time, and thanks for taking my questions. So I guess, either Doug or Fritz, if you want to take this one. Just kind of curious if you guys can maybe talk for a moment about the sequential build that, Doug, you referenced in the business beginning in May and you\u2019ve seen it continue on through July or into July.",
            "Could you maybe talk about what types of customers you\u2019re really sort of seeing the most sort of upside from? And are you seeing spill-over from the truckload market? Do you think at this point - just any sort of clarity on sort of where the building strength is sort of most apparent?"

      },
      "21": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So Jack, one of the real challenges with this right now is that, I\u2019ll call it, the variability or the volatility of not only daily sort of shipments and tonnage, but then also what the impacts has been on our customers\u2019 supply chain.",
            "So one of the interesting things that we\u2019ve seen as we\u2019ve come out of this or emerged out of the sort of the depths of this is that it\u2019s - the freight patterns have changed and they\u2019re changing pretty frequently for us.",
            "So it\u2019s - there is not a good call out because you - some days, you\u2019d say, wow, three days in a row in this part of the country, it seems to be doing well. Then you got a little bit of a pullback, maybe there is a pandemic uptick or perhaps that customers restock.",
            "So it\u2019s - I think what\u2019s interesting about what right - is going on right now is underlying sort of changing supply chain and the bit of the volatility that comes with that. Overall, the trends have improved, as Doug described. But what\u2019s interesting is that underlying sort of daily, weekly change continues."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Got you. Got you. And then I guess for my follow-up question, just sort of curious where you guys think you stand today relative to maybe your available capacity? You referenced headcount, excuse me, you referenced some capacity constraints.",
            "So just sort of curious where is headcount now relative to March? And sort of how should I be - how should we think about that layering back in? And how much available capacity do you feel like you have in the network today to be able to handle an economy that we hope is beginning to continue to accelerate?"

These are the complexities of running an LTL network where we\u2019ve got to adjust both manpower and assets as we need to match the customer demand."

I mean, it\u2019s a much larger industry, so small shifts in truckload supply impact our industry in a pretty meaningful way. So if it continues and the tightness continues, I\u2019d say, we\u2019d probably expect to see some of those heavier volume slip down into LTL.",

So there has been a less consolidation on the truckload side. They don\u2019t seem to have that luxury. Their pricing is much more volatile. They get it when they can get it.",

We want to be consistent and approach our customers in a professional way each year and discuss the environment and get the needed rate. And we have - we\u2019re able to do that because probably the consolidation that\u2019s going on in our industry. Supply doesn\u2019t come and go as easily as it does in truckload."

We wouldn\u2019t expect necessarily to see that in the next quarter and moving forward. about - of the $5 million-ish year-over-year increase, about $1 million of it was related to premiums and that was around our insurance renewal that we completed in February.

There\u2019ll be an introduction of a handheld that will replace existing handheld as well and integrate with some of these software tools that we put in place.

When sort of ground falls out from underneath you and you\u2019ve got to adjust quickly, we proved we could do that, maintain profitability of the business and now be in a position we can grow out of it. So I think that that\u2019s what\u2019s - to me, I\u2019m optimistic looking forward."

            "On an operational - one of the things that was particularly impressive is we put in our sort of social distancing operational policies in a matter of days. And then we -- as the quarter developed, we enhanced those. You learn things as you go. So it\u2019s kind of a continuous improvement, sort of a process. Some of the things you learn out of that are things that you hope to longer term fully operationalize.",
            "So one of the challenges that we have now is that we\u2019ve - we\u2019re social distance. We are a company that has long really valued communication with our employees and connections with our employees. Well, if a driver doesn\u2019t come into a terminal right now to maintain social distance, that sort of interaction doesn\u2019t happen, right?",
            "It\u2019s - we\u2019ve got to figure out other ways to communicate with the employees and to maintain that culture and that sort of support for that team. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re working on and looking at different options. That\u2019s - part of it\u2019s going to be technology-driven, part of it\u2019s just going to be getting past the pandemic.",
            "I think the other element that we\u2019ve learned through this process is that the line-haul network we\u2019ve talked about is an opportunity around optimizing that. And certainly as we have become more of a national player, optimizing that line-haul network, it helped us in the downturn here because we\u2019ve been able to reroute around cities or locations that maybe have been impacted.",
            "Well, you take those sort of key learning\u2019s and tools and that\u2019s something you apply in a more normal world going forward around how do you optimize the network to support the more profitable freight or the better markets that you want to compete in. So I think that that\u2019s something we learned in the downturn that we\u2019ll take advantage of going forward."

Obviously, there is speculation or talk of capacity exiting the marketplace on the TL side, how much do you think that\u2019s impacting smaller players in the LTL side as well?",
            "And at the same time, there\u2019s also been news of new entrants in the LTL space, both from asset-based carriers as well as asset-light carriers, and then one of your larger competitors just got a bunch of financial assistance recently.",

            "Well, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s kind of hard to say. I mean, you could look at it from a couple of different angles. I mean, over time, we\u2019ve seen continued consolidation, right, over the very long-term. The environment has gotten more and more difficult when you think about insurance cost, technology requirements. The cyclicality of our business puts pressure on carriers if their balance sheet is not able to withstand it.",
            "So over the last few years, even as good as the freight environment was in 2018, for example, we saw capacity leave in 2019 in the form of a small company failure. So the pressures that are out there for a truckload they impact all of us as well in those few that I mentioned to you.",
            "So it\u2019s hard to say. The new entrants - I mean, in terms of building a national network, nobody has done that since deregulation, nobody has set out to build an international network.",
            "So I think as we fill out the geographic map and we\u2019ve built to near fully 48 states covered with our own facilities, there is a huge value in that to us, because that\u2019s something that would be hard to replicate."

            "So if you can again remind us like what\u2019s the path to gapping or lower in a meaningful way in the coming years, kind of what\u2019s the path to low-80s or better? Is that primarily topline driven or kind of what\u2019s the algorithm there?"

         "Remarks": [
            "I think, Ravi, it\u2019s several elements of Saia\u2019s strategy. First and foremost, we talk about the pricing opportunity when compare that to the market, getting paid for the great quality and service you get with dealing or working with Saia. I think it\u2019s capitalizing on the Northeast expansion, developing those markets, both inbound and outbound.",
            "The really exciting thing about the Northeast is it gives us an opportunity to leverage our legacy networks. So the pre-Northeast expansion, 34 states, we had the Northeast. You have the opportunity to sell from a place like Dallas in the Northeast and that\u2019s incremental to Dallas, that\u2019s incremental to Northeast.",
            "So the value of that sort of network dynamic, you pouring that additional revenue over a fixed cost basis both on a corporate level, but then also on the line-haul network, you have the opportunity to optimize that. And then you look beyond the Northeast, and I think the other really interesting thing about Saia\u2019s long-term opportunity, and it quite frankly is still there. We have 169 terminal network and you look at some of the other larger competitors that have similar sort of service offerings or ones that are a little bit better than ours, perhaps or benchmark a little bit or longer term success, if you will, those networks are anywhere around 200 terminals or above.",
            "And so if we have the opportunity to as we generate returns in the business in real estate, in markets where we can build additional density for us, move closer to the customer, I think it\u2019s the third element of what drives value for Saia over time.",
            "I think you add all those things up and I think it says, we have the opportunity to drive the OR into the 80s. And most significantly, second quarter was a tough quarter, but it was one about execution in a really difficult environment. And I think that that performance, you translate that into what maybe a more normal environment going forward, I think it\u2019s pretty compelling opportunity for us."
