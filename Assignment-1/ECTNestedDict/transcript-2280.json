         "Thank you, Paul. Starting with High Purity Cellulose on Slide 6, second quarter sales decreased by $14 million, driven by 22% decline in commodity pricing, primarily from viscose pulp and a 16% decline in CS volumes, compared to the previous guidance of an 11% to 12% decline. The accelerated volume decline was driven by reduced demand for automotive, industrial and construction ethers grades, plus an additional 2% due to logistic issues, both of which are COVID related.",
         "Declines in CS volumes were offset by a 72% increase in commodity sales volumes due to improved productivity and mixed shifts from prior year. EBITDA for the segment was $31 million, down $3 million from a year ago. Price declines were significantly offset by improved costs, driven by lower wood, chemical and energy input costs as well as improved operational reliability. Compared to the first quarter of 2020, EBITDA improved by $5 million, primarily from higher commodity product sales prices and volumes as well as lower costs.",
         "Turning to Slide 7. Sales in our Forest Products segment declined $11 million from the second quarter of 2019, driven by a 21% decline in lumber volumes, as we took proactive measures to curtail operations for several weeks in the beginning of the quarter, as demand for lumber dissipated at the height of the pandemic. Volume declines were partially offset by 5% increase in sales, as we were able to improve our sales mix with the reduced volumes. EBITDA for the segment improved $13 million from prior year driven by reduced costs for wood, labor, energy and duties.",
         "Additionally, prior year results included a $4 million inventory valuation adjustment, which did not repeat in 2020. As a reminder, EBITDA results include $6 million for lumber duties paid in the quarter. Since the start of softwood lumber duties on shipments into the U.S. in 2017, we have deposited a total of $72 million of duties and accumulated approximately $3 million of interest on the deposits.",
         "In prior trade disputes, Canadian producers have historically recovered all or a vast majority of these duties upon resolution. The next step in the process will come later this year or early next year, as the tariffs are expected to decline from 20% to 8% once the preliminary determination is finalized.",
         "Turning to Slide 8. Paperboard segment sales declined $7 million as sales volume fell 12% from prior year, primarily due to the timing of sales in the year. Meanwhile, EBITDA for this segment improved $5 million driven by lower raw material costs and reduce transportation costs.",
         "Turning to our Pulp and Newsprint segment on Slide 9. Sales declined $22 million from prior year due to a 9% decline in high yield pulp prices, and a 19% decline in newsprint prices. Additionally, results were impacted by a 17% decline in high yield pulp volumes due to sales timing, and a 43% decline in newsprint volumes as the company elected to take market downtime due to reduce demand caused by COVID-19. EBITDA for the segment decreased by $12 million to a $4 million loss driven by the lower sales partially offset by reduced costs.",
         "Turning to Slide 10 on a consolidated basis. Operating income was flat to prior year at a $15 million loss. Impacts from market price and volume declines were offset by significant costs improvements from prior year, lower input costs and the benefits of continuous improvement effort helped offset the market headwinds.",
         "At the early signs of the global pandemic in the first quarter, we approached our banking partners proactively to seek more operating room in the face of the significant uncertainty in the global industrial and consumer markets. In June, we finalized an amendment to our senior secured credit agreement.",
         "Key terms of the amendment are laid out on Slide 11. In addition to improved liquidity, we obtained a larger cushion against our covenants. We also amended the definition of covenant EBITDA to carve out the non-cash gain and losses associated with long-term currency fluctuations. In return, we increased the LIBOR floor on our borrowings to 1% from 0%.",
         "We also agreed to limit the amount of cash that we hold on our balance sheet and the amount of standby letters of credit that we can issue. In addition, we agreed to incremental reporting obligations and pay the consent fee. Overall, the amendment provides us with the increased covenant headroom and added liquidity needed to manage through uncertain market conditions spurred on by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "Turning to Slide 12. Total debt remained at $1.1 billion. We have moved to a gross leverage test as part of our recent amendment based on our LTM covenant EBITDA of $122 million, our gross secured leverage ratio finished at 4.8 times compared to a covenant requirement of not more than 6.2 times. While the interest coverage ratio ended the quarter at 2.0 times compared to a covenant of 1.6 times, a 20% cushion to the covenant.",
         "We ended the quarter with $166 million of liquidity, including $49 million of cash, $98 million available on our revolving credit facility and $19 million from our factoring facility in France. Liquidity improved $21 million from the prior quarter driven by $16 million of free cash flow in the quarter and the amendment to our credit agreement.",
         "With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Paul."

         "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome again to Rayonier Advanced Materials\u2019 second quarter 2020 earnings conference call and webcast. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Paul Boynton, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Marcus Moeltner, our Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance; and Frank Ruperto, our Executive Vice President of High Purity and High Yield Cellulose businesses.",
         "Our earnings release and presentation materials were issued last evening and are available on our website at rayonieram.com. I\u2019d like to remind you that in today\u2019s presentation, we will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Our earnings release as well as our filings with the SEC list some of the factors, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we may make. They are also referenced on Slide 2 and 3 of our presentation material.",
         "Today\u2019s presentation will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures as noted on Slide 4 of our presentation. We believe non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information for management and investors, but non-GAAP measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included on Slides 17 through 20 of our presentation.",
         "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul."

         "Good morning, and welcome to the Rayonier Advanced Materials Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open to your questions with instructions follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.",
         "I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mickey Walsh, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations for Rayonier Advanced Materials. Thank you, Mr. Walsh, you may begin."

      "Paul Boynton": [
         "Thank you, Mickey, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start by saying how proud I am of the way the team has operated over the past six months in safely supporting our customers. Managing our complex assets in a normal environment is challenging. The global COVID pandemic has added a whole new level to this complexity and our teams have responded admirably.",
         "Throughout the pandemic, we\u2019ve kept pace with the demand for all of our products, serving as a reliable source of supply to our customers and enabling them to continue to provide uninterrupted support to their critical end markets. In product markets where we\u2019ve seen demand weakness, we\u2019ve been able to flex down our production to appropriate levels.",
         "In June, we successfully executed a significant plan maintenance shutdown at our Jesup facility safely bringing in over a 1,000 contractors under adherence a very strict protocols. We are planning similar maintenance outages in Fernandina and Temiscaming in the coming months. Financially, results were pressured by the pandemic and did not meet our expectations compared to guidance, but we are seeing some signs of improvements in certain areas, which I will discuss later.",
         "Let me first provide some highlights for the second quarter as laid out on Page 5. Overall, we delivered $19 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter compared to $21 million last year. Our ongoing efforts to reduce costs help offset pressure brought on by the COVID pandemic. We saw significant price decline in commodity High Purity Cellulose products. This goes in fluff pulp as well as in both high yield pulp and newsprint compared to prior year.",
         "Those are the specialties enforced products volumes were impacted by reduced demand stemming from the pandemic. Corporate costs while improved from prior year contributed to a missing guidance, primarily from non-cash charges. We generated $16 million of free cash flow in the quarter, as the team did a good job of minimizing CapEx and reducing working capital.",
         "I\u2019ll now ask Marcus to go into more detail on the quarters\u2019 results. Then I\u2019ll provide you with an update on key actions we\u2019re taking response to COVID-19 and provide a perspective on our markets before opening up the call to questions. Marcus?",
         "Hey, thanks, Marcus. Turning to Page 13. As noted, we\u2019ve taken decisive action in response to the COVID-19. First and foremost, safety has been and will continue to be our overriding priority. We have implemented exacting protocols in all our facilities to protect our employees and our operations. Our teams strict adherence to protocol has helped mitigate the spread of the virus and its impact on our employees and operations.",
         "Office and support staff continue to work remotely in most areas, including our Jacksonville, Florida headquarters and other global offices. Second, to control costs and minimize pandemic driven losses, we have taken certain curtailment measures with respect to both our newsprint and lumber facilities.",
         "While our lumber assets are back to operating near capacity, we are currently addressing weakness in the newsprint market by matching our production to market demand. We will continue to monitor these and other assets to assess whether business conditions warrant implementation of additional measures. Third, we are focused on maximizing cash flow and liquidity.",
         "As Marcus has highlighted, our credit agreement amendment provides us with further financial flexibility and improved liquidity. We are executing against our cost savings initiatives, and remain on track to reduce costs by $20 million to $25 million in 2020, excluding the benefits of market tailwinds for raw materials.",
         "Additionally, we remain intensely focused on free cash flow generation, including prudent deployment of essential CapEx and rigorous management of inventory levels. Finally, we expect to receive a significant cash benefit later in the year in the form of a $31 million tax refund, largely attributable to CARES Act features passed earlier this year.",
         "Wrapping up on Page 14, the COVID-19 pandemic has kept our earnings well below our potential. We are taking the necessary actions to manage through its impact to benefit the economic recovery on the backend. As the industry leader and owner of five of the eight global manufacturing lines dedicated to cellulose specialties, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the term. We have been encouraged that our go to market strategy implemented in 2019 has helped stabilize cellulose specialty prices in 2020.",
         "Our HPC assets also produce approximately 500,000 tons of commodity viscose fluff and other pulp products. These products have been significantly impacted by current market conditions and are trading roughly $135 to $250 per ton below five years historical average prices. Normalizing for these sales prices would generate $80 to $95 million of incremental EBITDA through price improvement alone.",
         "In our Forest Products segment, we are seeing significant market improvement. A rebust repair and remodel market has helped fast recovery in the early second quarter and rebounding housing start levels have allowed this momentum to continue. As a result, prices for lumber were up considerably in July compared to the second quarter. Our order file remains strong with bookings out over six weeks.",
         "Additionally, we expect duties on sales to the United States from our Canadian mills to be reduced 8% from 20% later this year or early next year. Given that half our lumber sales come from the United States, this could provide a welcome benefit to earnings. In paperboard, we continue to experience stable sales volumes. Paperboard margins may experience some pressure as pulp prices are expected to rise based on the forecast of many analysts. However, we would expect this pressure to be more than offset by rising prices for our high yield pulp products.",
         "And as noted earlier, newsprint remains under pressure and we are constraining our newsprint production to meet demand and minimize losses in this product category. Irrespective of the market environment, we remain focused on taking costs out of the business through our continuous improvement program. Our commitment is to remove costs out of the business each year at a level sufficient to offset inflationary pressure. As mentioned previously, we are focused on maximizing free cash flow through minimizing working capital and efficiently allocating capital to maintain our assets.",
         "Lastly, we are continuing to evaluate our portfolio and monitor capital markets for opportunities to increase liquidity and extend maturities. We are confident that we will emerge a stronger, more resilient company.",
         "With that operator, please open up the call to questions."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to start out here, I mean, as we think about earnings and the potential to improve from here. Opportunities does Rayonier have to increase EBITDA beyond the cyclical improvements in its various commodities. I mean, I know you talked about getting $80 million to $95 million from the improvement in commodity products pricing, and then also the kind of $20 million to $25 million in cost reductions for this year. But wanted to see, what else you might have in your arsenal here?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "John Babcock"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Hey, good morning, John. Thanks for the question. John, if you remember, at the beginning of the year, we kicked off a program, we are calling internally act now, right. And so that was real big push. And with that four different key elements, right. Operating cost improvement, we talked about $15 million target, corporate cost elimination $10 million to $15 million. Both of those were on a strong target to achieve, if not exceed. We also talked about, CapEx reduction of $10 million to $15 million. And again, I think we\u2019re on pace to improve upon that.",
            "And then finally on working capital improvement, we talked to as an opportunity out there, $25 million. I think that\u2019s one area we\u2019re a bit behind on, and that\u2019s largely related to COVID and moving inventories around. But I think the proven in the back half of the year is there and we\u2019re going to continue to target that.",
            "So I think good success on things that we\u2019re controlling in the immediate future. As we look beyond that, right, you mentioned right, just restoring commodity markets will improve pricing significantly and therefore EBITDA alone. We continue to have a lot of focus on new product efforts. And we\u2019ve got some opportunities out there.",
            "And again, it\u2019s going to be somewhat COVID related as these opportunities come around for these new products, just as the markets return. And of course, as you\u2019ve heard in the past, John, we\u2019ve worked hard and we continue to work hard to stabilize our cellulose specialty business and improve pricing there, which this year we\u2019re doing a stabilized, it should be slightly up for the year as we indicated it\u2019s not flat. And again, we hope we can continue down that path as well.",
            "So I think we had a lot of fronts here, both internally and externally with markets to improve EBITDA going forward. And if you keep in mind, just 24 months ago, we were well above a $300 million EBITDA. So we are certainly under significant pressure at the current time, but I think we\u2019re doing a good job at managing through it. And we do see an opportunity to improve upon that as the years combine in the near future."

And the synergy piece is probably the smaller side of that, $46 million, call it, maybe $5 million for that quarter. We continue to see gains on wood, chemicals and some energy inputs. And remember, we\u2019re anniversarying higher costs on wood last year that we had down in the U.S. south and also the productivity impact that we had up north in Temiscaming."

      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So for the most part, no disruptions in HPC at all in our high purity business or paperboard or high yield pulp, we had some disruption on transportation. On all of those actually, but not in the actual assets itself, when it comes to the actual assets itself, disruption is really around the curtailments that we talked about newsprint, as well as sawmills. We took those assets to actually down significantly in early in the quarter, taking out maybe up to a third of our volume capacity as a result of the COVID. And then the balance again is really disruption based on either transportation or as we talked about just overall demand in the high purity area and you saw that impact our volumes for the quarter."

      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And so that volume, I assume that\u2019s kind that 2% in HPC that was from logistics issues. And on that, I mean, will you get that volume back or is that volume that\u2019s, I guess, lost for now."

         "Remarks": [
            "On the logistics side, that would have rolled from one quarter to the next quarter. That\u2019s really shipping delays. I think the broader decrease from the 11 to 12 that we put out last quarter to the 16, the other half of that really is what we\u2019re seeing reduced forecast from our customers as they\u2019ve seen some demand weakness in their end markets. Specifically, in the construction and the industrial and automotive sectors, the one thing I would say though, is that it feels like most of that reduction was communicated kind of in the second half of Q2 and things feel a more stable now. As we\u2019re looking out through the rest of the year, that being said, the one thing that we continue to see is, uncertainty \u2013 and customers concerns about uncertainty on how quickly economies recover and where governments put money to work to drive those economic recoveries."

            "Okay. Thank you. And then just last question and apologies for all these. But just quickly, I guess, I want to kind of confirm here, so what are your peers ultimately took pretty significant downtime. Or I guess has curtailed production on the mills. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read about this. I wanted to see if there are any sort of commercial opportunities here for RYAM and how you\u2019re kind of reading that situation."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Let\u2019s give two answers to that. I\u2019ll start and let Frank continue. And first of all, yes, so you\u2019ve talked about some HPC, high purity capacity going out of the market. Certainly, we\u2019re prepared for all scenarios as well. And however, I think we\u2019ve been very fortunate with the quality of our products and the strength of our customer relations. We\u2019ve continued to see volume come in, even at the commodity level, where a lot of the volume, particularly in the viscose area has actually evaporated disappeared. We continue to have good steady orders come across.",
            "So that\u2019s been helpful. And I think it supports our overall cellulose specialties business, when our customers see the stability of our assets. Now taking advantage of these opportunities, let me just turn it over to Frank and maybe he can comment on that."

         "Speaker": "Paul Boynton"
      },
      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I think, John, the closures have been relatively recent and it\u2019s a bit early to call any real change in the market. Remember that, most of the facilities that tend to close or take downtime is, it happens after inventory has been built or they keep some key supply lines that supply important customers relatively whole. That said, we have seen some modest opportunity to step into supply chain disruptions that the closures have caused and believe that we will benefit in the future.",
            "To what extent, it\u2019s still to be seen. We\u2019ve kept all of our lines open. As Paul said, given our ability to place all of our tons due to quality of these commodity grades in the long-term relations we have. I would tell you that security of supply has become more important than many of our customers size and that we believe that customers should be putting a premium on the ability to have a stable and secure supply source.",
            "So I think that will help us going forward. It\u2019s just too early to tell how long some of these assets will be down and the inventory work-throughs and the re recovery from the demand side how that will impact more broadly, but obviously, it\u2019s \u2013 it should be a positive for us. The magnitude is really the question."

So when Lumber\u2019s going parabolic, like, it is currently. Can you convince the guys and I guess guys and gals to stay on the job? Like, how much production will you lose if in fact \u2013 if I\u2019m correct about this kind of global vacation?"

So we\u2019ve got all our assets up and running full. We did take our normal downtown. We tried to keep as many assets up and running as we could. Steve, if you look at, what we\u2019re expecting, we took substantial downtime in April, right.",
            "So we took over a 50,000 board feet out of the market at that time. And if you look at the balance of the year, we\u2019ll have a stronger back half of the year than the first half as a result of that curtailment, but we won\u2019t quite come up to last year volume levels. So just to kind of put that in perspective, but obviously we\u2019re running well now. And we\u2019ll try and do everything we can to take advantage of it.",

And so we\u2019re trying to take advantage of the strength of the market and continue to place orders out there. But a significant change in volume in the back half of the year, outside of normal capacity just happened. It\u2019d be more in normal lines, what we\u2019ve seen in the past years."

I mean, could we kind of not flip flop, but because of the holiday, but be kind of north of 150 million board feet.

We\u2019ve clearly seen a benefit to having capacity to run into other new product opportunities, as well as just run the viscose pulp on a more stable basis over that time.",

I\u2019d also say that a major part of that realignment was moving our sea line in Jesup to fluff pulp. And the spread of profitability on fluff over viscose this year given how weak viscose has been meaningful for us and so that has been a very positive move of that as well.",

Of that $7 million was wood, chemicals was about $10 million and maybe $2 million of energy. The balance of that is kind of that operational improvement as you stabilize an operation with a more predictable grade run, right, less grade changes. So that\u2019s where that shows up then."

There\u2019ll be some times we\u2019ll probably flex up, run both lines, flex back down to run one line, and maybe we\u2019ll take them both back down again if the markets don\u2019t improve.

If there\u2019s some positive news out there, and there is, is that there some of the capacity in the Ligno area has come out of the market, particularly, I\u2019m referencing a South African asset that is not running now.

But right now, we are now seeing volumes closer to kind of plan levels than, and that was missing in the past as the products has been kind of slowly ramping into the market and mainly because of an oversupplied market.

And year-to-date, our CapEx is obviously at a lower run rate. But as you know, it has some correlation to maintenance outages. And we just completed Jesup, and as Paul mentioned, we\u2019ve got Fernandina and Temiscaming coming on. So you should look at it as up from the first part of this half year. But certainly, we\u2019re being prudent on the amount that we deploy."

But I guess what I was interested in was the working capital, there wasn\u2019t an inflow in the second quarter. Given all your volumes down, I would expect it \u2013 and presumably, raw materials down, I would expect a working capital inflow."

And then we hope to bring that receivable down now and continue our progress towards the working capital target that we mentioned that Paul alluded to. So again, we\u2019re focused on that. It\u2019s more difficult in this COVID environment, but a lot of it moved into receivable."

And I don\u2019t mean to just completely go from one to the other. But like mix in a few percent or up to 10% or something like that in end market that customers might elect to do? Or can they do that? Or is it \u2013 does it just not work? It\u2019s too hard to specify that in for their customers, your customers\u2019 customers?"

It can a little bit here and there in different applications. But for the most part, the viscose pulp, the lower purity pulps that are out there, are being made for the textile markets, right? And so it tends to stay focused there. So I don\u2019t think we see a lot of migration back and forth. At the cellulose specialties, it\u2019s certainly one of the things our customers will try to do is do everything they can to figure out how to optimize their costs. So they are always looking at opportunities like that. But I\u2019m not aware of any major breakthrough in that regard and don\u2019t expect any. Frank?"

            "No, I\u2019d agree. I think customers are always looking to find ways to lower overall input costs, but product quality and performance issues tend to pop up on lower-quality, lower-grade pulps. What we do see more often, though, is CLP, cotton lint pulp, is often used in ethers applications because there\u2019s very high alpha and has good brightness and the like. And a lot of our focus has been on developing products that can go after that market. Two benefits to that. One is, obviously, it can expand our volumes in the CS arena significantly.",
            "Second is it doesn\u2019t impact the competitive landscape because we\u2019re not pulling share from other DWP producers. We\u2019re focused more on pulling share from cotton lint, and that is something that is a key focus of ours as we move forward, especially out of Tartas, who have developed some very, very high viscosity products there, as well as trying to work with Fernandina to do similar things. So we are seeing some of that as an opportunity. But on the first question, no, it\u2019s minor, and it\u2019s typically not all that productive."
