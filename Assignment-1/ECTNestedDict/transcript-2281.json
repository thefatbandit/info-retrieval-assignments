      "Michael O\u2019Leary": [
         "So in terms of current developments, as you know, I said, we returned to service in the 1st of July, 40% of our July capacity, covering about 90% of the network, but obviously with reduced frequencies. In August, we expect that to grow to about 60%. And in September, we\u2019re hopeful, particularly, there\u2019s a successful return of the schools across Europe, that we\u2019ll see about 70% of our normal September capacity.",
         "The big challenge facing us going forward is going to be the illegal state aid that has exploded all over Europe, and those airlines engaged in below-cost selling to the damage of the level-playing field in European aviation. We, and Ryanair, remains Europe\u2019s low-cost leader, but even we are rightsizing our business now to \u2013 rightsizing the cost base to reflect the lower fare environment we expect for the next couple of years.",
         "We are hopeful that the first MAX deliveries will take place in the winter of 2020. That is subject to the aircraft, the Boeing MAX aircraft successfully returning into service in North America at the end of Q3. I am \u2013 couldn\u2019t be more excited about the post-COVID-19 growth opportunities that will emerge all across Europe. We are in the initial discussions with airports, but some airports are losing enormous amounts of their existing traffic and will have to respond competitively to that loss.",
         "The Brexit risk has intensified, but everybody is aware of that. And therefore, we think our outlook really, we can\u2019t give you guidance on the full year in terms of profitability, but we think 60 million on traffic is a reasonable stab, but that could be impacted if there\u2019s any significant second wave of COVID-19, either across the continent of Europe this winter or spikes in different European countries. Just to briefly touch on the successful return to service on the 1st of July, we\u2019re running about 40% of the normal July schedule, covering 90% of the routes, but with much lower frequencies on those routes.",
         "And we\u2019re hopeful \u2013 we\u2019re on track, I think, to exceed a 70% load factor, whereas the initial guesstimate was that we do a 60% load factor. Some of that success has been delivered with the comprehensive health measures that we\u2019ve rolled out for both our crews and our passengers on board. Many EU governments are easing the lockdown restrictions. In fact, there\u2019s now largely free travel between most of the EU 27 members. The only exception of that has been Ireland, which has been slow and is not managing the reopening of its economy, particularly well. They produced a green list in recent weeks, which is very restrictive, and we think not sensibly based, and we are \u2013 continue to call on the Irish government to open up short-haul travel between Ireland and the other EU 27 member states. On-time performance has been excellent during July. We\u2019re running on-time performance of over 85%, combination of very good fleet reliability and also, very good European ATC performance given the lower volumes of our flights across Europe. We would expect or to continue to control \u2013 have a controlled return, controlling that capacity growth where we see outbreaks of COVID-19 or a dip in passenger bookings, we have the flexibility to sit those aircraft on the ground.",
         "So our capacity and our load factor will be controlled into H2, but maybe kind of \u2013 are bumpy. Traffic is very heavily dependent on there being no material second wave of COVID-19 across Europe in the second half of the year, and that\u2019s why our figure of \u2013 passenger traffic figure of 60 million is very tentative. We will look where we see opportunities, use seat sales to stimulate demand, to recover traffic, to try to build load factors and restore ancillary sales because we think a good strong winter will actually gear the way or pave the way for, hopefully, a strong return to normality in the summer 2021. But obviously, much of that will depend on there being a successful vaccine emerging for COVID-19.",
         "Just a quick summary of where we are on the illegal state aid to the legacy carriers. Lufthansa has received combined almost \u20ac11 billion, even Carsten Spohr has admitted that this is more money than they needed or wanted, but he\u2019s happy to take as much as he can get. Air France, KLM and Alitalia, an airline that has been bankrupt and should have been bankrupt, it has now received \u20ac1.5 billion from the Italian government. Ryanair remains the huge cost leader, but we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re taking advantage of the crisis to try to reduce costs wherever we can. We have rolled out significant pay deals with most of our pilots and cabin crews across Europe.",
         "We think working with our people to lower pay. We\u2019re looking at pay cuts of up to 20% for the best-paid pilots, down to as little as 5% for the lower-paid cabin crew. That\u2019s a much better solution than just job losses or thousands of job losses. And our people, I think, are working with us on that. There will be headcount reductions, however \u2013 such as in Germany, where the pilots union remarkably voted against this deal. We\u2019ve now announced the closure of three German bases in Tegel, Niederrhein, Weeze and in Frankfurt Hahn. We are in the early stage of discussions with airports around growth deals. We haven\u2019t made as much progress as I would like to have made at this stage, but a lot of that is because the airports themselves aren\u2019t really sure of where they\u2019re going to suffer the biggest capacity cuts because the legacy carriers haven\u2019t laid them out yet.",
         "We\u2019re also working with our suppliers to improve terms on maintenance, marketing and almost every other cost line. Lauda and the management team have now had done terrific work over the last two months. They phased down the close, they were about \u2013 they had actually announced the closure of the Vienna base because the local Austrian unions wouldn\u2019t agree to the new CLA. Thanks to the heroic efforts of the pilots and the cabin crew in Lauda, that decision was reversed, and the union was embarrassed, I think, into supporting the agreement that had already been supported by over 92% of Lauda\u2019s pilots and more than 67% of Lauda\u2019s cabin crew. However, the Stuttgart \u2013 Lauda Stuttgart pilots voted against the deal in Stuttgart and as a result, that base would close at the end of October. Lauda has also negotiated new lower aircraft lease rates. And with the new pay deal and lower costs, we think Lauda, in the next 12 months, we hope will break even or will go very close to breakeven.",
         "The big driver for us in terms of costs going forward, though, is going to be the new lower-cost MAX aircraft, which we hope to take deliver of this winter. This aircraft will deliver us 40% \u2013 or sorry, will deliver us 4% more seats per flight. It will deliver a 16% lower fuel burn and also a 40% reduction in emissions.",
         "This aircraft is the key to a really seismic reduction in Ryanair\u2019s unit operating cost for the next three or four years, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the game-changer aircraft or its deliveries, which hopefully will happen before the end of this year. In terms of the growth opportunities, as I said, there are huge gaps emerging across European aviation as a result of the failure of certain airlines, Flybe, Germanwings, Level, SunExpress and others. Competitors will retrench, in some cases, in return for the state aid. Air France, for example, has announced that its capacity will be cut by 20% in 2021 and similar capacity cuts have been announced by a number of the other EU flag carriers.",
         "We would hope to exploit those cuts, particularly where we were able to show our airport partners that we have up to 44 new aircraft coming for the summer of 2021, that we can reverse or deliver them traffic growth in circumstances where some of their incumbent carriers are withdrawing from the marketplace. I\u2019ll touch briefly on Brexit. As I said already, we expect the UK is leaving the European Union at the end of December.",
         "We hope that some common sense will prevail and that they will see the benefit of Europe and the UK negotiate a trade deal that covers air travel. I think the impact on the UK economy of the grounding of the air flights for the three months during the COVID period has been \u2013 I think has \u2013 would have helped, I think, to firm up the political view that air travel is a necessity, and they won\u2019t want to repeat the shock of that or have any interruption to flights. So we\u2019re hopeful that there will be a trade deal that will cover air travel and therefore, there will be no impact on air travel, at least, of a no-deal Brexit."

      "Neil Sorahan": [
         "I will. It was a very challenging quarter for the Ryanair Group. We saw our fleet grounded for almost four months, moving to March until the back end of June, and that meant the traffic dropped by 99%, just 1.5 million customers within the quarter. Load factors were just over 60% compared to 96% load factor last year, and revenue was very heavily hedged. We saw a \u20ac2.2 billion reduction in revenue to just \u20ac125 million. We did a lot of work on our costs, which led to an 85% reduction in costs over the quarter, but unfortunately, that didn\u2019t offset the reduction in revenues, and we recorded a net loss of \u20ac185 million in the quarter. As I look over to the balance sheet, we\u2019ve got a very, very strong balance sheet. BBB+ rated by Fitch and S&P. Our cash was up in the quarter compared to year-end, where we had a cash balance of just over \u20ac3.9 billion compared to \u20ac3.8 billion at the end of the last financial year. We also have a very high number of unencumbered debt-free aircraft on the balance sheet, 300 Boeing 337s, with a conservative book value of about \u20ac7 billion. So market value is somewhat higher than that. So one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. Michael, back over to yourself.",
         "Okay. Just on the outlook, as Mike has already said, it\u2019s way too soon to put any kind of P&L guidance since the market saw a huge amount of uncertainty around what may happen with COVID towards the autumn periods. Equally Brexit brings its own risks. At this stage, our best guess is that we will have 60 million customers in the current year, which is a 60% reduction on the 149 million that we carried last year. Significant work has been done within the airlines to get the cost base down further. So we right sized the business for the challenges that are going to lie ahead, particularly from state-aided carriers who\u2019re now \u2013 would be able to sell below cost. Our focus will be to keep the balance sheet strong, preserve cash, get the cost down. But we\u2019ll hopefully be in a better position to give you an update on the P&L portfolio when we meet again, at the AGM in September or in our H1 \u2013 or H2 results in November."

      "Operator": [
         "Okay. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Ryanair Q1 Results Conference Call. I\u2019m joined this morning by our Group CFO, Neil Sorahan, and we\u2019ll move straight through. As you\u2019d have seen this morning, we released our Q1 results for the quarter ended the 30th of June. We reported a Q1 loss of \u20ac186 million compared to a Q1 profit of \u20ac243 million in the prior year. Traffic in the quarter fell by 99%, as all of our fleet was essentially grounded from the middle of March until the end of June. Our Q1 traffic fell from 42 million passengers last year to just under 0.5 million passengers this year.",
         "Cash preservation has been prioritized by the company in the last quarter, and I\u2019m pleased to report that our closing cash balance is \u20ac3.9 billion. This will be important going forward. Cost reduction measures are being successfully implemented across, not just Ryanair, but all of the group airlines. And we have initiated what we believe was a very successful return to flying at the end of July \u2013 end of June, and where we expect to accomplish about 40% of the normal July schedule during July. As I say, we plan to operate about 40% of the normal July schedule. We hope to grow that to about 60% of the schedule in August.",
         "And then hopefully, I assume there\u2019ll been no spikes in COVID-19 across Europe, that we would get to 70% of the normal schedule in September. One of the biggest challenges posed to us by COVID-19, apart from the fleet grounding, has been dealing with customer service and a huge backlog of refunds caused by these government-mandated groundings. I\u2019m pleased to report that our customer service team were doing an extraordinary job, and we expect to have about 90% of all of the cash refund request from customers processed by the end of July. At this time, we expect the full year traffic to fall by about 60%, will fall from 149 million passengers last year to, at best, 60 million passengers this year. That will be entirely contingent on there being no second wave of COVID-19 in the autumn or the winter. And obviously, we\u2019ve seen some recent spikes in places like Barcelona and that is impacting short-term bookings. However, over the medium term, we have seen the closure of a significant number of airlines. We\u2019ve seen Flybe disappear, Germanwings closed, Level in Austria has filed for insolvency and SunExpress in Germany. However, going forward, the competition in Europe will be distorted by the wave of state-aid subsidies being poured by some EU governments into their inefficient flag carriers, most notably, Alitalia, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa and TAP.",
         "And that is going to pose a challenge over the medium term, where we\u2019re going to be competing with these flag carrier-subsidized airlines who will be engaged in below-cost selling. However, this poses a significant opportunity for Ryanair, the Ryanair Group of Airlines and our airlines. We are lowering our costs. We will face lower fares and yields for the coming years, but we think we have the business model to sustain that. To touch briefly on the quarter. As I said, revenue fell by 95% from \u20ac2.2 billion last year to just \u20ac125 million this year. We\u2019ve managed an 85% reduction in costs during Q1, but that clearly wasn\u2019t sufficient to make up for all the revenue loss, which is why we\u2019re reporting a quarterly loss of \u20ac185 million.",
         "Our cost leadership is where we\u2019ve been focusing our energies over the last quarter, and that would be vital, if our group airlines are to compete against these hugely subsidized flag carriers in Europe for the next number of years. And this is what underpins a lot of the cost reduction measures we\u2019ve been negotiating, lower cost pay deals, modest pay cuts with our pilots and cabin crew as a better alternative to widespread job losses, and that process continues successfully, I might add. We\u2019re talking to our aircraft lessors and also Boeing about lowering the cost of the new aircraft orders we\u2019re purchasing. We\u2019re in active negotiations, but with Boeing, on compensation for the delay in aircraft. And those \u2013 the relationships we have with our aircraft lessors, we are renegotiating monthly aircraft lease rates to reflect the harsh environment. And certainly, the more competitive lease market environment caused by COVID-19.",
         "We remain a devoted or committed supporter of the Boeing MAX aircraft. We\u2019re pleased to see the recent progress that Boeing have made with the test flights of the MAX aircraft. And we are increasingly confident that Boeing will achieve their return to service delivery \u2013 return to service date in North America sometime at the end of Q3. We hope that would be sufficient to allow us to take some deliveries of MAX aircraft before the end of calendar 2020.",
         "And if that\u2019s the case, then we would be hopeful of being able to take delivery of the first 40 of those aircraft in time for summer 2021, and that would be key because in summer 2021, we want to be able to offer our airport partners across Europe growth potential, work with them to enable to \u2013 work with them to reverse the significant and in some cases, catastrophic traffic losses that they\u2019ve suffered as a result of COVID-19, and we think there\u2019s opportunity to do so.",
         "The balance sheet in Ryanair remains strong. As I said, our year-end \u2013 our quarter end cash balance is \u20ac3.9 billion. So we remain in good shape but clearly, we\u2019re facing into what would be a difficult winter. And cash preservation and paying down debt, both to the UK government and the first bond as it falls due in mid-2021, will remain key priorities. The challenge Brexit hasn\u2019t gone away. The UK will leave the European Union in December of 2020. We continue to hope that this will be done in a managed or by agreement, certainly where air travel is concerned. I think the experience of the UK During the COVID-19 outbreak and the priority with which they gave the return of air bridges, will hopefully serve as a lesson or a reminder that the UK needs to have open air access with the rest of the European Union and will spur, at least \u2013 a trade deal, at least, that will cover the air travel segment. However, if there is a hard Brexit, we have a series of airlines, most of which have European AOCs, and therefore, we think we\u2019ll be far less impacted than UK AOC holders will be. In terms of outlook, I\u2019m afraid, it\u2019s too early to say. We really can\u2019t give any guidance on for the full year.",
         "We think 60 million passengers for the full year at this point in time is an ambitious target. The risk to that is on the downside. If there are spikes in COVID-19, particularly towards the end of the autumn or early winter as flu season spreads across Europe, we may suffer some cutbacks on that. That traffic will only be delivered on the back of lower airfares. And I\u2019m convinced that in the actual fact, the way to get Europe air travel moving again is with lower fares and price stimulation. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s utterly key that we negotiate lower costs across every cost line with our people, with our aircraft suppliers, with our maintenance providers, and that process is underway. Those are the opening remarks, and I\u2019m now going to take you through \u2013 myself and Neil will take you through the quarterly slide presentation.",
         "So unchanged in many respects, we are the lowest fare, lowest cost airline group in Europe. We\u2019re number one for traffic. While that meant 149 million passengers last year, we think we\u2019ll do well to carry 60 million passengers in the current year. We remain the number one airline for coverage across Europe, 240 airports, over 2,000 routes. We have, I think, delivered a very successful return to serve flight services from the 1st of July, but that return and that recovery of our flight schedules remains dependent upon the European governments continue to successfully combat the spread of COVID-19.",
         "We have a very strong BBB-rated balance sheet, and we believe our combination of financial strength and lowest cost will make Ryanair the long-term winner. As you\u2019re well aware, Ryanair offers the lowest fares. Our fares are lower than any other European airline, and that\u2019s why we believe we will recover strongly coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Allied to those low fares, we have, by far and away the lowest unit cost. Our unit cost per passenger, excluding fuel, is at least 26% below our nearest challenger in Europe and materially up to 71% or 100% lower than most of the other so-called low-cost airlines in Europe."

Revenues, more or less dried up completely in the early weeks of COVID, no bookings coming in the door, and we saw a \u20ac2.2 billion reduction in revenue. It\u2019s just \u20ac125 million. While we did great work on costs throughout the quarter, we had an 85% reduction, but that unfortunately, wasn\u2019t enough to offset the reduction in revenues. So we recorded the loss."

            "Yes, I mean, the refund issue has really exposed the kind of anti-consumer behaviour of these unlicensed screen scrapers. The big challenge we face is that the screen scrapers make bookings for third-party passengers, but they put in fictitious e-mail addresses and falsify credit card or the payment details. So we can\u2019t automate refunds to those people, and we run the legal risk that if we issue a refund to an unlicensed screen scraper and they don\u2019t pay the consumer, then the consumer ultimately will sue us. So what we\u2019re trying to do is to open up a new mechanism, whereby the end-of-line consumers can apply directly to us for their refunds.",
            "And although clearly, some of them were quite shocked when they find out that how much they\u2019ve been overcharged by the screen scraper when they receive our refunds, but it is a problem. We are continuing to call for policing and reform of these unlicensed intermediaries with the regulatory agencies, particularly the CAA in the UK and their equivalent, IALPA here in Ireland."

Air traffic control due to reduced volumes in the sky has also performed very well. So we\u2019re seeing on-time performance in the mid-90% at the moment, which is excellent."

We really need a better sense of where bookings would be though, early to September, October before we make a final decision on the winter schedule. And that\u2019s why our full year guidance of 60 million passengers is tentative at this point in time, and it could go lower. In the last week, for example, as there has been a spike in coronavirus cases around Barcelona, we\u2019ve seen bookings to and from and within Spain being hit. And I think we\u2019ll see more of those kind of developments."

There was a lot of pent-up demand coming into Q2 as lockdowns were relaxed. A number of people wanted to get out, get some sun of the summer period, visiting friends and relations also has performed well. Businesses is a lot slower, and I think we have to wait on people get back to their offices in the autumn before we see an uptick in that. And it\u2019s inevitable that we\u2019re going to have to stimulate demand over the winter with lower fares, particularly as we try to take on the flag carriers which now have a \u20ac30 billion of illegal state aid, which will enable them to sell below cost probably."

We\u2019ve limited the in-flight service, removed teas and coffees during the month of July, and we\u2019re really trying to do everything or follow most of the sensible guidelines that were published by both the European Centre for Disease Control and the ASA on the 20th of May, last. In many respects, the airlines have gone ahead of most national governments in making face masks mandatory. In fact, Ireland, for example, when they made the face masks mandatory in shops in the middle of July, we were many months ahead of them. But \u2013 and I think we\u2019ve been encouraged. I mean I thought we might have some customer resistance on face masks. But to date, during July, the \u2013 our customers have been terrific. Our crews have been terrific, and everybody has adjusted remarkably well to the new face mask experience on board."

We introduced recruitment freezes. 50% pay cuts for our people into April and May, and indeed, we\u2019re continuing to negotiate pay cuts across the board at the moment. And we were lucky enough and able to participate in a lot of the government\u2019s payroll support schemes across Europe, for which we\u2019re very grateful that we can, given the opportunity to do that, but we\u2019re looking at every cost line and have looked at every cost line."

None of those can be finalized until we actually know when the aircraft will be delivered. We\u2019ve engaged in extensive negotiation over the past number of months to reduce pay modestly and in, I think a very fair way, with pilots, cabin crew, they take the reductions upfront and then those pay cuts are restored to them over the next three or four years.",

I don\u2019t think, for the next two or three years, but those are all likely because we\u2019re going to have to continue to pass on those cost savings in the form of lower fares to stimulate a return to travel across Europe and also to be able to compete against these state-aided flag carrier airlines who will be below-cost selling for a number of years into the future."

We\u2019re also looking, I think, at some base closures in Spain, where at the moment the unions have not yet agreed to the pay cuts we need and I think there\u2019s a real risk to some of the region bases in Italy, where you have a combination of slow pace of negotiations with the unions, but also the Italian government trying to impose Alitalia\u2019s pay rates and a business productivity on other airlines and other airports within the sector if that leads to significant decreases in cost then.

And I think we\u2019ve been heartened by the success of Apple and the Irish government in front of the European Court of Justice in recent weeks, overturning the challenge that was made to the Apple tax base here in Ireland. And I think it demonstrates that the European Court of Justice is willing to stand up for the European law, where I think the performance of the European Commission in ruling over on some of these egregious illegal state aid and has been a base. I mean the idea that Lufthansa has run around hovering up state aid, not just in Germany, but in Austria, in Belgium and in Switzerland. And in fact, Carsten Spohr is correct.",
            "He didn\u2019t expect to get that much state aid. He\u2019s receiving more than he actually needed, which in itself, is in breach of the state aid rule. So I\u2019d be reasonably confident that we will be successful in these \u2013 opposing the state aid grants. The challenge and the difficulty will be, it will take us two or three years in these court hearings and the appeals \u2013 the inevitable appeals to be kind of run their course in which case, we will have suffered a number of years of below-cost selling by Alitalia, by Lufthansa and others and to the damage of Ryanair and our shareholders' interest. So yes, we\u2019re pursuing the state aid claims, and we think they\u2019ll be successful, but it\u2019ll take us some time."

They had hoped to grow to 38 A320s in their fleet this summer. That\u2019s now being capped at 30. They\u2019ve also renegotiated new CLA with their staff, their pilots and cabin crew in Vienna, which is leading to pay reductions, enhanced productivity and rosters. Unfortunately, their base in Stuttgart is going to have to close, and that will go over the end of October. What this means is that they are now going to make a positive contribution to Ryanair Group as a wet lessor and have a good future, we believe within Ryanair."

Malta Air Now have 120 Boeing 737s in their fleet, and they\u2019re actively involved in cost negotiations with their people across the various markets that we operate in.

There\u2019s reasonable prospect, I think, at this point in time, that the aircraft will be certified for return to commercial service by the end of Q3. We hope by the end of September. The Boeing MAX 200 that we\u2019ve ordered are running probably about \u2013 it will take about a two-month certification period. So we would be hopeful at this stage that we\u2019ll see the first of our MAX deliveries by maybe the end of this calendar year.",

We\u2019re going to hold off any further seat sales because, frankly, we need the aircraft. We have to exploit that growth opportunity we see across Europe. There are 14, 737 lease returns by May 2021. We are in discussions with the lessors on those aircraft.",

Because of the impact of COVID-19, we have stopped its growth, so it is limited to 30 aircraft, and we won\u2019t be adding any further aircraft in the Lauda fleet, I think, for the foreseeable future, unless there\u2019s some significant pricing opportunities on the Airbus side."

We remain, however, hopeful that a trade deal will be done or negotiated, will cover air traffic between the UK and the European Union.

I think the UK was very keen in recent weeks to reopen air bridges and restore air travel between the UK and Continental Europe.
