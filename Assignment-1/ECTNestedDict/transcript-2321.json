         "Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. First, I will provide comments around the quarterly results. Then I will offer more detail around the key variables that Michael just discussed. And finally, I'll walk through our updated full year guidance.",
         "This morning, we reported second quarter revenues at $27.7 billion, an increase of 51% over the second quarter of 2019 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.40 this quarter compared to $1.34 last year. These numbers were in line with the guidance that we provided at Investor Day in mid-June.",
         "As expected, our earnings for the second quarter of 2020 were uniquely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic through muted medical utilization and increased membership.",
         "Total revenues grew by approximately $9.4 billion over the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of the acquisition of WellCare, membership growth in Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplace business and expansions in new programs in many of our states.",
         "Our HBR or health benefits ratio was 82.1% in the second quarter, compared to 86.7% in last year\u2019s second quarter and 88% in the first quarter of 2020. As anticipated and highlighted at our Investor Day, the HBR was low by historical measures and the decline was primarily driven by a reduction in medical utilization as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased costs associated with COVID-19 claims.",
         "Utilization was down across all of our business lines. The majority of the reduction in volume was driven by ER claims and other non-inpatient costs, including fewer elective procedures, PCP visits and specialist visits. Utilization declines were partially offset by COVID-related medical costs, including inpatient and ICU admissions, testing and treatment. In terms of monthly trends, utilization deferrals experienced during April and May largely reversed in the month of June. June claims activity was near the historical norm.",
         "Cash flow provided by operations was $3.7 billion in the second quarter or 3.1 times earnings. The cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 2020 increased due to the net earnings growth $1.4 billion in collections of previously delayed capitation payments and an increase in other long-term liabilities driven by the recognition of the risk adjustment payable for Health Insurance Marketplace in 2020.",
         "We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position of $1.1 billion in unregulated cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. During the quarter, we utilized $500 million of our unregulated cash to pay down our revolving credit facility.",
         "Debt at quarter end was $16.8 billion, which includes $89 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt to capital ratio was 39.7%, excluding our non-recourse debt compared to 41.9% in the first quarter of 2020. Our debt to capital ratio would have been 38.1% when netting our unregulated cash with our debt at quarter end.",
         "Our medical claims liability totaled $11.4 billion at quarter end and represents 51 days in claims payable compared to 47 days in the first quarter of 2020. DCP was impacted by the timing of medical expense during the quarter with lower medical costs, primarily in April contributing to the metrics increase.",
         "A quick update on the WellCare integration. In July, we successfully integrated the WellCare business to the Centene financial and HR systems. The integration continues to be on track and we remain comfortable with our synergy capture efforts.",
         "Turning now to our 2020 expectations and our updated assumptions regarding the key dynamics and variables we continue to monitor closely, which are formed by additional data since our Investor Day and month end. The midpoint of our year end unemployment expectation continues to be 10.3%, which is consistent with what we provided at our Investor Day. We now expect peak membership growth of 1.4 million members to occur during the fourth quarter. This represents a change from the projection of 1.9 million new members provided at our Investor Day, which was forecasted to incur in August.",
         "As Michael mentioned earlier, new membership has enrolled more slowly than previously expected. We believe the temporary nature of some of the unemployment enhanced unemployment benefits and employers furloughing rather than terminating employees has all contributed to lower application rates than what is implied by overall unemployment levels.",
         "For example, in California, we have not seen significant membership growth since the onset of the pandemic. In terms of utilization trends in the back half, we continue to expect normalization as the economy recovers and our members go back to visiting doctor's offices and receiving treatment. Our early look into our July claims shows a slight step down in utilization compared to June as a result of the regional infection spikes occurring across the nation. This trend may or may not last depending on the spread of the virus in various states. And again, the numbers we are seeing from our July claims are very preliminary.",
         "Through the end of June, we have paid approximately $550 million associated with COVID claims. This compares to $221 million we discussed at our Investor Day. One thing to highlight the cost we have categorized as COVID costs include all the claim codes consistent with CDC guidelines. This includes costs that are not associated with confirmed positive cases and may include costs that are not related to COVID at all.",
         "Finally, I'll translate these factors into our updated 2020 financial guidance. We now expect revenue to be within the range of $109 billion and $111.4 billion. This is $500 million lower at the mid point than our previous guidance driven by the previously mentioned membership expectations. As Michael mentioned earlier, we are providing our estimates based on where we are today. Ultimately, our membership continues to increase for the remainder of the year will affect our revenues. However, just to add some perspective, our revenue guidance continues to be $5 billion higher than our original March guidance at the beginning of this year. This is a higher baseline from which we can continue to grow into the future.",
         "We are maintaining our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance of $4.76 and $4.96 driven by our overall updated projections and medical costs and revenues. With respect to rates, we continue to work with our state partners on various risk sharing mechanisms and advocate for actuarial soundness. We have included a reasonable amount of rate actions in our guidance today; however, there continued to be a lot of unknowns and the majority of our state partners are focused on 2020.",
         "It is our understanding that a majority of the proposals received to date have not been approved by CMS. Additionally, there continues to be discussions in Congress of additional support that would provide relief to state budgets and affect any potential changes being contemplated by the states.",
         "As we think about earnings progression for the balance of the year, we expect third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be approximately 20% of the full year 2020 EPS. ",
         "A quick note on quarterly versus full year modeling. As a result of the WellCare acquisition closing the first quarter, the full year weighted average share count is substantially lower than the second through fourth quarters. We anticipate continued choppiness as a result of the unpredictable nature of utilization trends at this time, the scope duration and intensity of additional COVID-19 infection spikes could have a material impact on the results for the rest of the year.",
         "I'll conclude my remarks by reiterating our confidence in the strength of our business. Our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample liquidity and meet our operational and strategic needs. We remain focused on executing against our strategic plans and are committed to delivering shareholder value.",
         "That concludes my remarks, and operator, you may now open the line for questions."

      "Jennifer Gilligan": [
         "Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2020 earnings results conference call. Michael Neidorff, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Schwaneke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call, which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com. ",
         "Any remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recent Form 10-Q filed today, July 28, and the 10-K dated February 18, 2020, and other public SEC filings, including the risks and uncertainties described with respect to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business and results of operations. Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.",
         "The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2020 press release, which is available on the company's website at centene.com under the Investors section. Additionally, please mark your calendars for our third quarter earnings release, which is expected to take place on October 27, 2020. ",
         "With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?"
      ],
      "Michael Neidorff": [
         "Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning and thank you for joining Centene\u2019s second quarter earnings call. We hope all of you and your families are staying safe and well. There's a lot to discuss today, especially as the environment around us continues to rapidly evolve. I'll start by reiterating our confidence in the strength of our business.",
         "Centene was built to endure and manage through times of uncertainty. We have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity, we have experienced with crises, we have emerged from prior recessions with strong growth, and we see opportunities for continued growth today. With our scale, our diversity, our assistance, and our impact, we are confident in the strength of our business and our ability to continue to lead through this crisis.",
         "You have heard me say, we make decisions based on the facts as they are today, and never has this been more true or appropriate as we manage our business in this pandemic environment. I stated several months ago that we expect the environment and our financial results to be choppy from quarter-to-quarter, and I want to reemphasize nothing can be truer than that today. It is increasingly clear that we are going to be living with this pandemic for some time and probably well into next year. We're planning our business with that in mind.",
         "I'll remind you about the assumptions we made in June about what to expect in the development of this virus. At that time, we expected the initial spring peak will be followed by smaller spikes during the summer and a potential second wave in the fall. However, the current trajectory shows the infection rates are rising significantly across a number of key states, and case counts continue to go up which differs from what we expected only a few weeks ago. With this trend in mind, we will continue to provide you with transparent updates and give you our best estimates as to how we see things at a particular point in time. First, utilization. Utilization returned to more normalized levels towards the end of the second quarter. Volume began to return in May, and June was virtually a normal month relative to prior years.",
         "With the recent surge in the virus, we are seeing some decline in utilization in July. Note that this data is preliminary and includes COVID-related costs. While we believe hospitals are better prepared to manage COVID cases after learning from the experience of the initial outbreak, there are indications that some hospitals are reverting back to delaying elective procedures, if necessary, based on a regional infection rate.",
         "Next COVID related costs. Centene has the capability and bandwidth to navigate ongoing COVID-related expenses. Based on the facts as we see them today, we were seeing COVID-related expenses increasing, which is offsetting decreased utilization. But again, as I stated, these are not normal times, so we continue to expect environment to remain dynamic. Case-in-point is our membership and revenue expectations. You'll recall in April, we raised our 2020 revenue guidance by $6 billion, including $4 billion in COVID related membership growth, which included the expectation that new membership would peak in August.",
         "Based on recent COVID-related membership trends, we now expect new membership peak to peak in November, resulting in a $500 million reduction in revenue against what we had forecasted only a short time ago. Membership is coming in at lower rates than initially anticipated, and growth was expected based on unemployment trends. This is driven by an assumption that unemployment may be temporary and by enhanced unemployment benefits and federal rates, which are all contributing to lower application rates. The trajectory of our membership growth for the remainder of the year will continue to be influenced by various external factors, which may shift our revenue expectations up or down.",
         "However, to put the impact of membership growth in context, we still expect to add a total of $3.5 billion in COVID driven revenue to 2020 as compared to the original guidance we provided in March. Our earnings guidance for 2020 remains consistent with what we provided at our Investor Day. At our scale, the earnings impact of $500 million is reduced \u2013 in reduced revenue can be offset. We recognize and are prepared to continue with the uncertainty based on what we know today. Our earnings guidance continues to be our most reliable baseline and remains our best estimate based on our revenues as well as utilization and COVID related costs among other factors. We remain comfortable with our current range. With that as a backdrop, let me turn to our second quarter results.",
         "Our results were in line with our guidance, which underscores the effect of the shelter-in-place policies on our diversified membership platform as well as our team\u2019s solid execution in a challenging operating environment. We reported second quarter revenue of $27.7 billion, an increase of 51% over the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.40 compared to $1.34 last year. This represents growth of 79%.",
         "Our membership was approximately 25 million at the quarter end. This represents sequential growth of 3% and year-over-year growth of 64%. Due to the uniqueness of today's environment, we expect 2020 earnings per share to be front half loaded. Applying the midpoint of our guidance, first half earnings per share of $3.31 would represent approximately 68% of our full year EPS. Overall, these results were solid.",
         "Looking ahead at the remainder of the year, the intensity and duration of the pandemic remains a primary driver of uncertainty, but we are built through uncertainty and believe we are in a strong position to continue to execute against our strategy and grow our business. We continue to hire talented and diverse individuals who contribute to our focus on improving the member and provider experience through technology. Over the past few years, I've spoken about our ambition to transform Centene into a technology company that does healthcare, recognizing the critical role of technology and providing extraordinary member and provider experiences to 25 million individuals that's nearly 1 in 15 Americans.",
         "We have made significant investments in modernizing our systems, and early last month we announced an investment in our new East Coast headquarters, which will be our hub for technology talent. Today, I'm pleased to announce yet another step forward in achieving our technology aspiration through the hiring of additional talent to that already present in our organization. Adding to current management, we're pleased to welcome Sarah London and Bryan Sivak to our technology team.",
         "Sarah most recently served as partner for Optum Ventures, working closely with portfolio companies on product strategy and expansion. Brian most recently served as Managing Director for Kaiser Permanente Ventures, where he led investments in healthcare focused organizations in transformative efforts. Both Sarah and Bryan will help accelerate innovation, modernization and digitalization across the enterprise. And in addition, since March, we have hired over 3,800 individuals and we will continue to invest in our talent to enhance the value we deliver to our members and communities.",
         "At the same time, we continue to operate in a remote work environment, but I am generally pleased with the levels of productivity and engagement across our business. And we have made the required investments in our office environments to ensure the safety of our people when it is appropriate for them to return. For example, we have installed plexiglass between cubicles, temperature, scanners and automatic door openings. We also continue to have courageous conversations within our company about racial and social justice.",
         "Centene has a diverse workforce at every level of the company, including our board of directors. And we continue to recruit and develop diverse talent. But knowing that everyone hired at Centene is hired because they're the right person for the job. Let me now comment on discussions we're having with our states. As states moved to reopen, we were working closely with our state and federal partners to develop solutions that address the cost dynamics states are facing.",
         "With state budgets and constraints, the role of managed care companies like ours, which maximize member outcomes and cost savings, has never been more important. While we do expect some short-term pressure on rates, these rates have to be actuarially sound.",
         "Our 2020 guidance incorporates what we know at this time and the majority of our conversations with states have been highly constructive. In addition, we have encouraged \u2013 we are all encouraged by ongoing budget discussions in Congress and the review of expanded FMAPs.",
         "Longer-term, we continue to believe that additional states will consider Managed Care as a solution to their health care needs. For example, in Oklahoma, the state has announced its intent to release an RFP in the fall of 2020. We are in active discussions with our state partners to ensure we are taking a holistic view on rates beyond 2020, taking into consideration, a return on normalized utilization and COVID costs, as well as appropriate risk-sharing mechanisms.",
         "In summary, Centene has risen to the occasion by delivering on our mission of providing high quality, low cost healthcare to the most vulnerable populations during this time. We are confident in the strength of our business. As I said, our balance sheet is strong. We have ample liquidity and we continue to see significant opportunities for future growth as we apply our all-product all-market strategies.",
         "The RFP process slowed during the pandemic, but it's now picking up in our Medicaid business. And our Medicare Advantage business remains strong untapped opportunity. As we have mentioned, before we have emerged out of recessions with strong growth in membership and new state contracts in the past. And we continue to believe that we are well positioned to execute on both our short and long-term growth strategy.",
         "Finally, I again want to thank and recognize our employees for their commitment and dedication. I could not be more proud of how we work together to serve our members.",
         "Before I turn the call over to Jeff, let me apologize for my allergies acting up in my voice. And with that, let me turn it over to Jeff, who will provide our financial details."

First question just around the rate proposal conversation that Jeff was mentioning, I think you said that, some of the rate proposals at the state level have not yet been approved by CMS, and you continue to talk about advocating for actuarial soundness. I just want to understand, are these proposals, what you're seeing in the states, is that what's incorporated into guidance as you sort of mentioned that you're including a lot of this in guidance, or is there a risk that those state proposals are actually approved and that is not consistent with actuarial soundness or something like that that would change your guidance.",
            "And then I'm sorry, but the second question would just be on the vaccine potential. Are you assuming that states will cover the cost of a vaccine, whether that's later this year hopefully or if not into next year and maybe how would you like to see the vaccine reimbursement work?"

On the rates \u2013 the state can adjust under the super ratings [ph] by 1.5% subject to programmatic changes approved by CMS. CMS has been very consistent with the need for actuarial soundness. There have been some states earlier in the year that tried to get them to waive it and they said no. So we'll continue to work with them. The guidance does include those things we know that makes sense to do, have agreed to with the states and maintain actuarial soundness. So we'll continue to keep you informed, but there is no draconian things taking place that we see at this point in time.",

You may recall at our investor conference, where the prior Medicaid director from Arizona talked about the need to set a date, where we've been talking to congressional representatives about the need to put a date certain in, so states have a better place the plan \u2013 have a better basis to plan for it. So we continue to work through it and it's something we've done ever since we've been in this business. Jeff, anything you want to add on that?"

And I think the biggest point here is that we keep advocating with states that there's just a lot of variables to go on between now and the end of the year, right? You have the COVID costs, you have utilization, you have potential federal stimulus. And so, I would just say if you package all that up, it's very fluid at this moment."

So as this unfolds, if I approach states on that now, they're going to say they have more current issues, Josh, really. But historically, that would be a requirement once again to keep things sound. So when things like Hep C came out, we had no trouble, which was very expensive. So I've even heard some talk where the government for public policy reasons or political reasons is talking about making vaccines available for mapping. So we will let that one play out a little bit."

I mean, again, as Michael mentioned, we're currently in active discussions with our states, and the starting point is rarely the ending point or ending result. And it just \u2013 it really isn't constructive for us to publicly discuss our individual state expectations or an aggregate number. That being said, we continue to believe that we're on a path in many states towards finding actuarially sound solutions to the budgetary strain. And we would like to also point out that at this point again, just a reminder of the federal \u2013 potential for federal stimulus. So I guess what I'd say is, we've included I think a reasonable assumption of rate adjustments from now to the end of this year. And that is the out of bounds I would say, that's what we're pushing to make sure it doesn't happen, is that we find rates that are actuarially sound and I think that's what Michael just talked about."

         "Remarks": [
            "Let me help with one other regards. The states in this year, when they saw reduced utilization, they were, oh, you're saving all this money. Well, they now understand that utilization will come back in the second half had it followed that path. And they also see as we usually report it in July, while utilization may be down, elective procedures, that's being offset by COVID costs. So they're now understanding that there is no windfall over the course of the full year.

But we have to be so careful how we say this, because as somebody opens up, we see a jump in \u2013 Missouri, they just announced they're going to roll back some of the things opened up. Restaurants are now back to 25%, bars are closing at 10 o'clock. I mean they're talking virtual schools. So honestly, it's shifty. I mean, Arizona was very low before it's hike. Texas was incredibly high, it's starting to back off a little bit. So it's a variable from day to day. So it's very hard to give you any kind of really specific well-grounded statement.

I told them that \u2013 we told employees we'll give 30 days notice before we reopen. And I said to them, I think maybe I don't see us reopening fully. Everyone will open sooner or later, but until after January 1. And he said to me, one of them said, 'I don't think you'll regret that'. So what we're saying is it's so fluid and so dynamic that it's just moving along \u2013 well, I mean, let's talk about what I'm concerned about, none of this affects the performance of this company, just recognizing these things are there, so you deal with it ahead of time and an treat the right expectations.",

Now, I want to get this commercial, we're doing a PSA now, people understand it. Everybody is telling us until we have a vaccine, the next best thing to do is wear your mask and encourage others. And I'm going to take some broad advice, I'll tell you what one of my epidemiologist told us, a couple. Tokyo, in Japan, there is 127 million people.",
            "And a lot of you know the Asian culture is masked for years, they have gone back in the 80s. Somebody thought they have a cold, you were a mask not to offend somebody. During the time that we had 100,000 deaths, they had 832. In Hong Kong, very congested, during that same period of time with 7 million people, they had four people die because they wore masks. So if we can \u2013 it depends. If people start to realize what they can do to help themselves and choose some good judgment, that can impact it. So we're doing all we can, as I am right now, trying to help people to understand it.",
            "So, I am hopeful that we will start to mitigate the intensity of the COVID until we have a vaccine. I'm also hopeful that we have a treatment, which will be very important. I was watching on one of the spaces today, there is some talk about that they hope to have some of that. So it's something we've never experienced but I'm comfortable that we have the expertise, the capabilities to deal with it."

We saw good growth in Florida, but hardly any growth in California. And so I think what you're seeing is just the dynamics of the unemployment market. But in general, effectively the memberships coming in slower than we would have anticipated and really looking at historical crises, financial crises, and trying to align membership growth, with unemployment is not spot on at this time. So we effectively lowered the membership expectations and that's what the $0.5 billion is for."

Again in the exchange business we've talked about margins normalizing. And so I think that's in line with what we were thinking.

And I guess what I would say is the majority of the customers had previously had health insurance. And the other thing is we've actually got our proportionate percentage, our market share percentage of the growth. But the other thing that's also happened is we've held on to members longer because of the premium assistance effectively. So really you're talking about holding on to members that we've already had and then you have the new enrollments. So the mix is I would say more weighted toward retaining the enrollment that we had at the beginning of the year."

The difficulty or the issue here and we're dealing with the world I believe is that in economic downturns, there is some historic precedent for what would happen. And what we're dealing with this pandemic is something I guess the last pandemic they say was in 1918, Spanish one. So the issue here is we projected minor spikes in some areas, it's not what happened. So as we've talked to the states, we're helping them understand that the COVID expenses offsetting the reduction in utilization. And so that's the counter-balance to what these cost savings.

And if you go back in time and look at our financial performance, I think you'd see it was very consistent during that time period. And I think the other thing to highlight is if you go back to the crisis back in 2008-2009, that's when a lot of organic growth accelerated for us and really driven by states moving to Managed Care in order to help solve their budget problems. And so we believe when states have budget challenges, we're part of the solution, because we can help manage costs and have higher quality outcomes.

            "Yes. So a good question. I would say, when I look at the March \u2013 quarter end March membership compared to June 30th, we're up about 812,000 members, predominant and at-risk members. I would say the majority of that from our perspective is due to the suspension of the redetermination. And I think we mentioned that at our June Investor Day. And so that's why we've kind of delayed our peak membership from August into November because it appears that there has just been a slower take up rate for the unemployment side versus the eligibility redeterminations. And right now we have assumed that the eligibility redetermination, the suspension of that goes through the end of this year because they pushed out the enhanced FMAP for another 90 days. So hope that helps again our new expectations is up 1.4 million in November, 1.4 million peak members in November versus our previous was 1.9 million in August."

First on the public exchanges, it looks like in the 10-K \u2013 10-Q that you've had a $94 million adjustment for the risk adjuster payable. I just want to a true up is that in line with what you had originally factored into your guidance earlier in the year? And is there any comment about the footprint? And whether you'll expand it for the public exchanges next year? And I'll go on and ask my other question, which was about the PBM. There were some things you were this year. I know WellCare extended the CVS contract. You had some other things you were doing at legacy Centene. Have those played out as expected? And is there anything about the COVID crisis that's materially impacted either what you're seeing and script trends or utilization of specialty drugs in the higher acuity population?"

So, again, we're using the combination of all the PBM assets to get the most value there. I think your other question, refresh my memory on your first question that you had."

And again, if you go back to our Q1 earnings call, we talked about the fact that because of the crisis hit in March, we weren't able to really do a lot of the coding efforts that we do.

So now, it's hard to get too granular on this, but I guess I'm also curious that there's a dynamic that maybe June's stronger utilization as deferred care was rescheduled and performed, maybe July had less of that. And just on deferred care specifically, I guess I'm curious how we should think about any remaining deferred care being performed in the back half of the year as we think about these overall trends.

The hospital is being prepared to do it, and the person being prepared to go to the hospital because there is that variable. As it relates to July [indiscernible] hospitals some of them we know, were starting to defer deferred care now. We have to assume that some of those patients were ours, because we have a big membership, but what percent in that, it's early. We don't have the details. As we sit here at this point, it's still July and we want \u2013 we haven't closed.",

And they may, if they don't have SSI or long-term care, but I'm not going to disclose who they are because it's not certain and they just \u2013 and as they probably asked other companies besides us, who they think their consultants are, but it's a clear indication that they are looking to start to save the money by expanding into those areas and they really understand that.

We know that the House put out two months ago a $3 trillion bill, the Senate was really delaying it and they have about $1 trillion and it's not going to be either, it's going to be somewhere in the middle. Now, the only thing I know with any certainty is I don't think that they will get the $600 and that's this my guess. So if I'm right you could say how smart I am, if I'm wrong, you can kid me about it, the rest of my life. But I don't think they're going to get to 600 because they realized some people were making more being unemployed than being employed. And that \u2013 on both sides there are people a little bit the wrong way. So we'll see that change, the FMAP and state support that's in the middle of negotiations now.",
            "And I think the FMAP has a chance because they recognize that. We\u2019re \u2013 our counsel is put a date certain on, as I said earlier. Relative to specific states report support, that's going to be hard. It's an election year, which really complicates this whole thing and there is a little politics being played out there. And so, I'm probably saying I expect it's going to be somewhere between 1.5 trillion to 2 trillion. I think we'll see some FMAP, I am hoping to some improvement there. We're going to see the unemployment. You're going to see another check go after people, some of those things. You're going to see the \u2013 if somebody hasn't paid their rent being displaced, you're going to see that probably extended, that type of thing.

So I don't think there has been any common denominator is what I would say from our perspective we haven't seen anything that's common across the ones that have grown versus the ones that haven't. And our assumption is that we continue to see growth and there will be, I would say, a lagging unemployment application growth. And there would be some more in California, but not to the magnitude that we've seen in other states. And so again, I think, as I mentioned, we're just going to have to see how this plays out, but we're sitting on 800,000 member growth today and getting to 1.4 million by November doesn't seem impossible. And I think that's a reasonable place for us to put the guidance."
