         "Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining DHT Holding\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. I am joined by DHT\u2019s, co-CEOs Svein Moxnes Harfjeld and Trygve Munthe and Wilhelm Flinder, Head of Investor Relations.",
         "As usual, we will go through financials and some highlights before we open up for your questions. The links to the slide deck can be found on our website, dhtankers.com. Before we get started with today\u2019s call, I would like to make the following remarks. A replay of this conference call will be available at our website, dhtankers.com, until August 18. In addition, our earnings press release will be available on our website and on the SEC EDGAR system as an exhibit to our Form 6-K.",
         "As a reminder, on this conference call, we will discuss matters that are forward-looking in nature. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations about future events, including DHT\u2019s prospects, dividends, share repurchases, and debt repayment; the outlook for the tanker market in general; daily charter hire rates and vessel utilization; forecast of world economic activity, oil prices and oil trading patterns; anticipated levels of newbuilding and scrapping; and projected dry dock schedules.",
         "Actual results may differ materially from the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements. We urge you to read our periodic report available on our website and on the SEC EDGAR system, including the risk factors in these reports for more information regarding risks that we face.",
         "Looking at the P&L highlights. EBITDA for the quarter came in at $178 million and a net income of $135.8 million or $0.92 per share. Adjusted for a non-cash change in fair value related to interest rate derivatives of $0.4 million, net income was $136.3 million or $0.93 per share for the quarter. This sets another new record in the company\u2019s 15-year history. OpEx for the quarter was $19.7 million or $8,000 per day average for the fleet, and G&A for the quarter was $5 million.",
         "Moving over to the balance sheet, the quarter ended with $138 million of cash. During the quarter, we prepaid $59 million under the ABN Amro and Nordea credit facility. The voluntary prepayments under the two facilities were made for all regular installments scheduled for 2021.",
         "Current availability under all are revolving credit facilities is $135 million, putting total liquidity at $273 million at qu arter end. Financial leverage is 39.4% based on book values, and 38.6% based on market values for the ship.",
         "Net debt is $582 million which equals an average net debt of $21.5 million per vessel. Looking at the cash bridge, the quarter started with $76 million of cash, and we generated $178 million in EBITDA.",
         "Ordinary debt repayment and cash interest amounted to 26 million, 52 million was paid in dividend, 10 million was used in scrubber and maintenance CapEx, 13.5 million was provided by scrubber financing, and 59 million was used for debt prepayment. Changes in working capital amounted to $60 million and the quarter ended with $138 million of cash.",
         "With that, I will turn the call over to Trygve."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q2 2020 DHT Holdings, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I must advise that this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, 11 August 2020. And I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Laila Halvorsen. Thank you. Please go ahead."
      ],
      "Svein Moxnes Harfjeld": [
         "Thank you, Trygve. The COVID-19 virus continues to present significant challenges with respect to changing crews at regular intervals. Consequently, many seafarers are serving longer periods on board than originally planned. There are too few ports and countries that facilitates crew changes and a variety of nationalities and immigration practices does not make this task any easier.",
         "Additionally, the time required for crew changes are longer than normal, and result in some off hire. At DHT, we have however had increasing success with crew changes and have to date have two thirds of our fleet in ports to change some or all the crew. This is a significant effort and achievement from both our seafarers and our shore-based staff.",
         "As Trygve discussed, we have taken advantage of the strong freight markets to build a meaningful book of fixed income for our fleet. Importantly, in this level of fixed income covers a significant portion of the company's cash costs and lowers the required rates in order for the spot ships to cover their remaining cash costs for the company.",
         "Specifically, we estimate that our 17 spot ships need to earn $2,800 per day for the company to be cash neutral for the remainder of the year. This does not take into consideration third quarter bookings to date; hence, we are well ahead of this number.",
         "Similarly, we estimate that the spot ships need to earn $11,400 per day to cover our cash costs in 2021. Cash breakeven might mean different things to different people. At DHT, it includes all crew cash costs, i.e. OpEx, G&A, scheduled debt repayments, interest, and maintenance CapEx. Both these numbers are very robust and comes as a result of our TC strategy and debt prepayments. We believe that they make DHT stand apart with staying power and ability to generate cash even in weaker markets.",
         "Our industry is highly cyclical. Our industry is also very capital-intensive. Further, it is essentially a spot business, offering limited opportunities to build truly long-term fixed income at rewarding returns.",
         "In recognition of this, DHT strategy is countercyclical. This means that we do different things depending on where we are in the business cycles. As you can see on this graph, our actions have been very focused during troughs and peaks. In late '13, early '14, we expanded aggressively by acquiring 16 VLCCs.",
         "In the following period when earnings and asset values appreciated, we stopped investing and shifted our focus by paying handsome dividends, buying back bonds at a discount, securing time charter contracts as well as prepaying debt.",
         "In the trough of '17, we again expanded by acquiring 13 VLCCs at attractive prices. During the recent period of strong earnings, we have continued to execute on our well-defined strategy and extend our solid track record.",
         "This included the following three key components: one, rewarding shareholders with generous formula-based quarterly cash dividends; two, securing fixed-income contracts for several of our ships at attractive rates; and three, allocating a significant portion of our cash flows to prepay debt and further strengthen our balance sheets",
         "These achievements are very important in anticipation and preparation for the next step in our strategy as we expect the next leg in the market to offer attractive investment opportunities. Our balance sheet will have capacity to make meaningful investments without relying on raising additional equity. This will ensure additional investments will be accretive to earnings. Further, we enjoy excellent support from our lending banks and are confident in credit being available when we require.",
         "In sum, we are now coming out of a period with exceptionally healthy freight levels and now position the company to be able to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities when they arise.",
         "And with that, we open up for Q&A. Operator?"
      ],
      "Trygve Munthe": [
         "Thank you, Laila. Let me then walk you through the operational highlights for the quarter. As you\u2019ve seen from the press release, our spot VLCCs earned $92,100 per day in the second quarter. The time charter ships earned an average of $62,700 per day. Fleet wide, the average then becomes $83,300 per day.",
         "As of today, we have covered 61% of the available spot days at an average rate of $51,400 per day. More importantly, if you are an investor; on the fleet wide basis, i.e. with the time charter ships included, three quarters of the Tanker days are covered at an average rate of $51,200 per day, and that is with no profit sharing on the four ships with such arrangements.",
         "Our aggressive pursuit of time charter opportunities earlier in the year was clearly the right strategy. With it, we have been able to extend the good times well into next year. On the cost side, the company continues to deliver stable and competitive numbers. Vessel operating expenses came in at $8,000 per day per ship for the quarter. Cash G&A amounted to $3.1 million for the quarter.",
         "Let us then turn to capital allocation. For the 42nd consecutive time, we\u2019ll pay a quarterly dividend. $0.48 per share will be paid on September 2 to shareholders on record of August 26. The amount equals 60% of net income divided by the fully diluted share count.",
         "In the quarter, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet by prepaying almost $60 million of bank debt. Specifically, we prepaid the 2021 regular installments on our two large loan facilities. In addition to the overall deleveraging effect, this move has a significant positive impact on next year's cash breakeven levels, something Svein will discuss in more detail in a minute.",
         "As you have noted, on the 17th of July, we exercised our call option on the 125 million convertible bond due August next year. The conversion price is $5.347 per share. Thursday next week is the last chance for bondholders to convert your notes into common shares. If they do not, they will be redeemed in cash at par on Friday the 21st.",
         "The potential cash redemption will be covered by cash at hand and a partial drawup on our revolving credit facilities. And on a general note, we'd like to add that we look forward to having this instrument retired from the capital structure. On previous occasions, we've been able to buy back convertible bonds in the open market at a discount. However, in recent quarters this has been impossible to repeat, as the bond has traded meaningfully above par, at times, seemingly, as if the call option was not priced in.",
         "So in this context, we elected to call the bond at par. With that, I'll turn it over to Svein."

            "Good. Trygve, congrats on the great quarter. I guess, I wanted to just kind of dial in on the two-year time charter that you guys were able to sign for Stallion, I think $42,000 a day. Is there a profit share component to this? And two, are there plans to do more of these? I know that you guys fixed in April for about 61,000 a day probably capturing before the surge trade. But it kind of just sends like I guess a bearish signal that current spot rates which are around, let's call it 18,000 a day, that these rates might persist and I guess put another way, is there a price level or duration that would encourage you guys to do more time charters versus spot, and is there like a percentage of fleet that you guys are aiming for to have like, times charter versus spot that you guys would think offers an optimal risk reward return?"

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "To the first part, there is no profit-sharing element on the time charter on Stallion as you referred to. To the second part, if there is a magic number on percentage covered on time charter and so forth, it is not. And that is really unchanged from over the years. We will pursue time charters when we think that the numbers make sense.",
            "So, if we can lock in rates that give a good return on the investment in the vessels that we have, then we'll do it. But it is not like we are desperate to lock in cash flow no matter where the rates are. So, we've done it in this upcycle, done as many charters as we could find. We did it in prior high markets, but you will note that in lower markets, we have not been nearly as eager to develop new time charter business. So, it's more a reflection of, what rate levels we see doable and not so much about the percentage of the total fleet."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, fair. Great. Thanks. And I guess there's like recent news coming on surrounding congestion in China, I think Kepler peg like around 80 some odd tankers currently being held up. And I guess, would you guys be able to have some sort of visibility into how much of this is a result of, playing forward in storage where charters are purposely holding or slow steaming right outside the ports as a form of floating storage, or is there like a some sort of structural bottleneck or COVID related congestion in China? And are you guys exposed to this in any way? And if you are, are the demurrage charges, I mean are they greater than the current headline spot rate?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, we think that number you mentioned certainly jives well with the reports that we are reading, and also what are \u2013 sort of Intel is picking up. We believe this is really a reflection of inventories being, quite full in China or latest issues with tanks. So, it takes time for the refiners that have now also reduced some of the throughputs to consume these inventories. And that's holding up ships.",
            "We don't really believe this is so much of a contango play that was much talked about in the spring. Also to your other part of the question, these ships that you earn demurrage rates, and the demurrage rates will very much be a reflection of when these charters were fixed. We have had some ships on demurrage in China and we still have, so this is where we get paid every day, and the rent certainly varies. But as the market has come off recently, most of these demurrage rates are meaningfully higher than the current spot market."

And I guess just my final question. I know that you said most of the crew discharging changes are going to take up a lot of the off-hire days and in your presentation or report I think you had 77 off-hire days in Q3.",
            "I just wanted to get a sense of how much of that is the crew [ph] changes? And if you guys are still going ahead with the five vessels that are just starting to go scrubber retrofits and if that will still happen this year."

But in general, it does take longer than what has been the norm in the past. Typically you will do this while you do other operations, either discharging or loading or bunkering imports.",

And we are trying not to focus on these two coincide with natural dry docking days, and/or when they will take the ships off-hire in any case. So that is something that we\u2019ll develop later this year and also into next year."

And has there been a lot that have already been converted? And then I guess last part of this question, to avoid the dilution, we look to possibly repurchase some of the amount of shares that you had exercised?"

            "As we said in our remarks, we've really been trying to see if we could buy some of these bonds in the open market, but we found the pricing to be unattractive. And then back in mid-July, our share price was basically right at the conversion price. So we thought and we were hopeful that we're going to be able to sort of call it and redeem it in cash. But of course, it's a 30-day notice period, so the share is trading -- or the stock is trading freely in between. So it is still too early to say whether it's going to convert or not or redeemed in cash but I think in terms of consequential action on the outcome, that's speculative at this point. So we'd prefer to see how it all shakes out at the end of next week before we decide a potential next move."

You\u2019ve seen our booking guidance for the current quarter, so by just waiting, we were afraid that dilution was just going to increase.

And then speaking of those quarter-to-date rates, obviously, very strong numbers, especially ahead of the benchmark rates you've been seeing in the last few weeks, but a little below your peers. Is this because of your time charters, I guess gave away some of that spot exposure upside in May and June? I mean what kind of premium did your scrubber-fitted VLCCs earned last quarter and maybe so far this quarter? And then what are kind of the current rate levels that you're booking at VLCCs, maybe your most recent or this week?"

And just multiply that delta with a daily consumption, and that's really our answer.",
            "So of course, this spread is -- it's much tighter now than what most people anticipated at the beginning of the year. But year-to-date, we have essentially recovered half of the CapEx on the retrofits that we have done, and it is not obvious to us that the margin is going to stay where they are. They might as well expand or go back out again. But that's speculative to have a strong opinion on it."

And the reason for that is that our time charter coverage is so much stronger this year than what it is for next year.

The first is I know that you guys take a very formulaic and systematic approach to how you think about buying and selling assets counter cyclically, as you've talked about. But -- and it does sound like you're a little bit more open to the idea of expansion now than you probably have been in the previous quarter. Can you maybe just remind me where you -- or where those thresholds are in terms of what you view as historically good prices versus historically prices where you'd rather stay on the sidelines?"

But I think all these preparations that we made for the company is to be ready when those things arrive. So we still think it's a bit earlier. We're not going to sort of flag a particular price for a ship. But if you look back at the sort of trough in '13 and '17, you would note that five-year-old ships were sort of below $60 million and newbuildings were below $90 million.",
            "So in '13 -- and then it was below $80 million in '17. So that's sort of some indication but time will tell where this asset price will go. We think one key parameter to look at here is that the yards, in general, are -- well, they have got very, very little business.",
            "And that might drive them to further reduce their pricing. And that will also, we think, impact the opportunities on second-hand ships. So that is really what we need to watch carefully now. But again, there's no rush. We are just preparing the company, and this might be a next year event. So\u2026"

There was no question that, that needed to be done but -- and obviously, I would say at this point pretty clearly, most of that is going to be converted into equity, but it does leave your share count a lot higher than what it has historically been. From a longer-term perspective, is that -- are you good with that or would you view the company is under levered, assuming that all of that is converted?"

As we've said many times that, for us leverage really translates into cash breakeven levels, and we have been very, very careful not to run those up. But our leverage is going to change with the cycle.",
            "So right now, we're maybe very conservative. You said under levered, but frankly if we were able to get it down closer to 0% leverage at this point in a cycle, we'd be even more excited because then we have tremendous financial muscle built in so that we can go out and buy things when nobody else there to do it when it's really at the trough. So that's what this is all about. And at that point, we'll still be happy to lever up to 50% or something like that. But again, it's the nominal numbers that drives it. But that's the whole clue here that we're setting up the balance sheet so that we can do the right moves in the trough."

So it's way too early to say that. And if you look at our past activities, we have done M&A, we have done newbuildings, we\u2019ve picked up distressed assets.

Variables just frankly not -- it wasn't really possible to take ships ashore and get crews off, etcetera, etcetera. But that is easing up, and although only on the minor scale. But then -- it's more of a sort of market economics we think that is driving this congested logistics, the logistical ability of the scrap yards."

So we don't really have any ships in that category. So we're not sort of following this market on a daily basis, if you like. But prices has gone up from the lows in the second quarter. I think that's also a reflection of some more activity."

We think that as you touched upon, certainly there is an inventory of ships are a good big classes of ships that are coming up for special surveys and intermediate survey. So if the freight rates are lacklustre, and expectations are low, that's typically when you see people call it quits and start recycling. But it really rides on where spot market is and where people think it's going to go."

It has been really stronger than most people anticipated in the third quarter, and that's partly because what we discussed on the congestion, especially off of China, but also off of the U.S. West Coast to pick another area.",
            "So this has tied up a lot of ships, and freight rates have held up much better than normal at this time of the year. Fourth quarter, normally, yes, it's a boost. And if we see an unwinding of the congestions around the world, then you could well see a situation where the fourth quarter is not as relatively strong as it normally is. So right now, everything is really a bit up in the air. It's hard to have a very strong conviction case on where rates are going to be in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter."
