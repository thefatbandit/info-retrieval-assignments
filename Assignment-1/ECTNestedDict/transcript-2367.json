      "Alan Hirzel": [
         "Thank you. And thank everyone for joining today. I am joined today by in this presentation by Michael Baldock, so hear both of our voices. Just to get it started on page one. You know, this year like many years is a confident investment in Abcam\u2019s future. We\u2019re going to talk a lot today about how we've been thinking about this past year and in the context of a multi-year growth story. And I look forward to going through that, as well as cover questions at the end.",
         "If you turn to page two. The presentation today and the discussion we have is covered by this disclaimer.",
         "Page three, our agenda, I'm going to start with the - just a few comments and reflections on how our purpose as a company, the people we have, the culture we built is inextricably linked to the growth and the kind of business that we're running, as well as how we've been operating during COVID. Michael, will then come online and talk about the financial performance of the business through this period. And then I will wrap it up with an overview of how our first year of the implementation of our five year planning strategy is progressing and how we see the journey towards our long-term goals and business.",
         "Page four. Throughout all of the presentations that we've done together, I've always started with our purpose how we're connected to life science and talked about how important it is that Abcam is pursuing a path towards influencing life sciences and having real impact on society. And that if we do that, well, it will translate into benefits for the society, but also for business and all stakeholders. I just want to comment on that a little bit.",
         "So page five. Our purpose if you ask every one of our people in the company, they will tell you our purpose, the reason we're here is to serve life scientists and to help them in their research or clinical mission, achieve their objectives faster than they would any other way. And that's what roots us all, what gives us strength and energy. And it's how we think about our growing influence on life sciences and ultimately, helping people have better lives, better health and better well-being.",
         "And no matter how we measure it, we're confident that the impact that we're having on publications, on clinically relevant projects, on the expansion of our portfolio into diagnostic platforms and beyond, that we're certainly progressing towards the kind of objectives we have to influence society and scientific outcomes and be the most influential company in the life sciences in that regard.",
         "If I turn to page six, and that doesn't happen without an amazing team of people around the world that are dedicated to that purpose. Over the years we have done a lot to make sure that our team is well compensated, well trained, works in great facilities, feels energized by what we're up to. And you can see some of the - you know, the history of that transition and kind of how people feel about working at Abcam in the chart around global employee, Net Promoter Scores. It's up tremendously over the last six years.",
         "And it's not just us saying we like to work at Abcam, there are other organizations like Glassdoor and 180 [ph] for women, who are recognizing that Abcam\u2019s is a great place to work. And I want to thank everybody who's contributed to the results that we're going to talk about today around the world because we\u2019ve not only done that, with their normal dedication, agility and audaciousness. This year has been of course, a very challenging year to operate and all of them have figured out ways to contribute to our growth story, whilst working remotely and working flexibly. And the team that you see here is an example of that.",
         "Page seven. The organization is getting larger. We're over 1500 people now worldwide. We continue to grow and develop our team. And of the roughly 500 people we've added to the business, 400 of those were new hires and about just under 100 were through acquisitions and integrations that we've done. So we're making a big investment in scaling the capabilities of this company. And we continue to do that throughout the period of the COVID pandemic, because we're confident in the outlook for the business.",
         "And you can see the spread here with people in terms of regions, and the kinds of technical skills they bring. I am absolutely confident that we've got an incredibly strong culture and team to deliver on the purpose that I talked about.",
         "Page eight, just a few comments about what we've been doing during the pandemic that's kind of over and above the normal activities of Abcam. We certainly feel we've strengthened the business during the pandemic. We've delivered to customers consistently even when we've had to shut our facilities entirely, like in the early days in China back in late January, early February. We were still able to get a few people in to ship some important orders.",
         "And, you know, we felt great about our global team's ability to manage that. We've introduced new products. We're committed to innovating and continuing to push on the technology areas related to COVID, and certainly had the opportunities to work closely with customers during this period has helped us see new opportunities to innovate and broaden the portfolio.",
         "In the diagnostics area, and then also in therapeutics related to COVID, we've had over 30 clinical collaborations around the world. And those involved helping provide components for lateral flow diagnostics, as well as creating antibody strategies for creating a kind of therapeutic response to COVID. And those are ongoing, and we're excited to have that role to play. And then like many other companies around the world, we've tried to provide some in-kind support for the local communities and where we work.",
         "Page nine. Over the past year, we've certainly been reviewing how we think about the impact of our business operations and how we communicate that kind of broader sustainability and with our growth objectives, because we believe they're intrinsically linked.",
         "So this year we've thought about the importance of sustaining value creations and sustainable developments around products, our people, partners and planet, and you'll hear us talking more about that, and the alignment of those goals with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.",
         "If I turn to page nine. We're just at the beginning - or sorry, page 10. Just at the beginning of outlining and measuring our commitments in each of these areas. And we'd like to make it easier for everyone to understand how we've always run the business, but to make it easier to sort of understand what we're doing and how we connect that to growing our impact and growing a especially responsible business.",
         "So that\u2019s it for the introduction. I hope that\u2019s a useful context. Now for the financial performance, I\u2019ll turn it over to Michael, page 11 to begin that section.",
         "Thank you, Michael. Turning to page 19. 11 months ago, we and the entire team of Abcam described in great detail our aspiration to and goals to build a business that was \u00a3450 million to \u00a3500 million in revenue and had attractive economics by kind of November 2024. And we continue to believe in that opportunity, and we're investing behind it.",
         "And what I want to talk about now is just the progress that we've made in the year one, and then I'll wrap it up from there. So if I turn to page 20, the six major drivers to sustain our growth are all important. And we've, in this first year been able to put capital and smart people with real talent and capabilities that we have brought in or developed over time, and good ideas to work in each of these areas. And I'm - I can say with great confidence and pride that the team has done more in the first year and we've been able to deploy more capital and more human resource into the long term growth of the company than we had originally anticipated even back when we were talking in November of 2019, and Michael just described the financial scale of that.",
         "And that was what we always wanted to do. And we wanted to put our foot on the accelerator, see how fast we could go. Because we know the faster we drive into the investment, the more likely and more secure the out years are going to be in terms of the financial outcomes from those innovations and things that we're building the company.",
         "But to give a couple of examples for each of these on page 21. Long may be true that we're still talking about research using antibodies. That's our core strength. And goal number one is to extend our leadership there and how we use digital technology to reach customers who want those products.",
         "And this year has been another great year of innovation. We've exceeded our target for product launches, we now have over 20,000 recombinant antibodies, and we're putting those products into higher performance, higher quality, more validation standards, more variations of products than ever before. And we're getting great feedback from the market that those products are performing well, both from, you know, kind of quality and satisfaction rate data, but also from third party reviews either in terms of surveys that were done, the likes of Biocompare, but \u2013 or also the citation share which is the share of references that are using Abcam products, both in antibodies as a sole reagent, antibodies also in immunoassays like ELISA's.",
         "And you know, ELISA story is really a great one because we've not been doing work in immunoassays for very long, but it's the adjacent moves that we made. First, beyond research using antibodies only and to have the immunoassays continuing to pick up steam and gain share versus our competitors in this way it's very satisfying and gives us confidence to keep investing in this area because there's plenty of ideas to go for.",
         "Page 22. The other components to our growth are the moves that we're making to expand into adjacent markets. And in terms of the first one, removing innovation constraints and launching new lines. This year, we've done exactly that, we've got our proteins business underway, and been able to launch not only the technical capability of making them, but also have customers beginning to buy them.",
         "Our cell lines, both engineered cell lines and lysates, again, added to the catalogue, customers are buying them. We expanded Fireplex into more high throughput uses for biopharmaceutical customers, those have gone very well. We're excited about potential there. And in all of these areas, all these adjacent areas, the product uptake despite COVID was still ahead of commercial plan.",
         "And the other area here, of course, is to move beyond Abcam\u2019s historic strengths in small volume academic buyers into more of a discovery partner for biopharma. And here too, I think we've made amazing progress over the last year by improving the both the scale and quality of the partnerships that we have, but also the strength of our commercial team to support them.",
         "Page 23. No, none of this product development work can be as effective as we'd want it to be without being a leading digital company. The advantage of starting as a digital e-commerce businesses we're a long way into knowing what that means. We certainly see opportunities to improve over this past year. The addition of new team members has helped us rethink where we're going to go in terms of our digital platform, and also helped us accelerate some of the improvements to our existing technology.",
         "Page 24. All these people, all these ideas, all these new product areas they need facilities and processes to work in. And I think, you know, it's not just building buildings, but actually improving how we do things. It's important to us. And over the last 36 months, we've seen a 50% reduction in the time it takes us to develop an antibody.",
         "That's a whole bunch of work and process reengineering, quality management, automation, real capabilities that we didn't have as a company before we started to build out a manufacturing supply team and also kind of advanced technologies in R&D.",
         "We\u2019re very proud of the teams that have been working on that and we still think there's opportunities to do more. And then we are doing the basics and around facilities and in the US in particular, over this past year we've initiated a pretty significant expansion and with 100,000 square foot, new building in Waltham, Massachusetts expansion of our Eugene facility and some further expansion in the bay area where we already have two facilities in order to accommodate our cell lines growth.",
         "So, you know, a very important agenda for us because we don't want anything to get in the way of our growth. And certainly its investing here ahead of our immediate need is important.",
         "Page 25. Michael mentioned, we're still pursuing acquisitions. It's, you know, the framework we're using is the same one that we talked about last November. We're trying to find opportunities to acquire really high quality biological reagent portfolios. And this can be in more acquisitions around antibodies and the related product categories that you see on this chart.",
         "And the question is just simply how do we unlock those opportunities at the right time when the sellers are ready to sell and that they're at the economics that we find attractive, but we, you know, this environment of COVID is certainly identified more opportunities than fewer.",
         "So just to summarize on page 26, we all, the board, the executive team, the organization feels like we have a great talented team, a very strong culture to - that has been tested and has thrived during COVID. And as we see through the short term effects of COVID to the longer term opportunities, we're confident in the sustainable and durable growth that is possible for this company. And based on the foundation that we have, we're committed to investing because it's very attractive when we get it right, and particularly with our own products, return on capital and the growth prospects of those are very attractive.",
         "And we've got a team in place and a process in place for being disciplined around how we invest. And I declare the first year to be a success in terms of our strategic plan that even with COVID going on, we were able to get so many things going. I certainly feel good about continuing to build on that success and in the financial year to come and the opportunities in terms of revenue growth that that's going to present in many years beyond that.",
         "So thank you for your attention. And Michael and I will make ourselves available for questions now."

      "Michael Baldock": [
         "Thank you, Alan. And good afternoon, everyone. If you could turn to page 12, please. The most important point I\u2019d like to make during our financial presentation today, is that we delivered a resilient top line performance against the backdrop of COVID-19, while continuing to invest in our long term growth strategy.",
         "Our revenues on a reported basis was flat at \u00a3260 million and benefited from a small foreign exchange tailwind. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined 1.4%. Our gross margin for the year contracted by 120 basis points to 69.2%, with most of the decline due to the impact of COVID-19 on sales.",
         "Other smaller impacts included about 1% for foreign exchange, some geographic mix and lower IVD revenues, which was partially offset by growth in sales or in-house products. We expect our gross margin to improve as the proportion of our in-house sales grow.",
         "After the strategic investments made during the talk - during the year, our adjusted operating profit was \u00a344.5 million. Those investments which I'll talk about later included 30% expansion in our global headcount, as Alan mentioned to approximately 1500 people. The integration of four acquisitions which brought in over 80 people and a doubling of non-cash costs comprising depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation.",
         "Our adjusting operating profit margin of 17.1% was below the target we set at the start of the year of 25% to 28%. But it's important to note that this was entirely attributable to the impact of COVID-19, together with the impact of the acquisitions made in the year. Had the second half sales continued the same trend that we saw in the first half, we would have been in line with our target. We continue to intend to invest further behind those acquisitions, as well as in our growth initiatives in the year ahead.",
         "Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share with 16.6 pence per share, reflecting both a decrease in earnings and an increase in share count resulting from the 5% share placing we did in April.",
         "The group continues to be highly cash generative, with cash generated from operations of \u00a363.3 million and this together with the proceeds from the \u00a3110 million share placing, means the group ended the year with a net cash position of over \u00a380 million, providing ample liquidity to support our organic investment plan.",
         "As set out in the interim results, the board see significant further opportunities for profitable growth and attractive returns on investment and believes that the best way to maximize shareholder value over the long term is to increase the group's flexibility to invest in those opportunities as they arise. This view is shared by a significant majority of our shareholders we consulted with and accordingly the board has decided not to declare a final dividend for the fiscal year.",
         "The board will continue to review this and the group's capital allocation and dividend policy on an ongoing basis with future distributions reflecting the group's cash generation investment opportunity.",
         "If we could turn to page 13, please. So let's turn to our revenue performance. Catalogue revenues which accounted for about 94% of the total in the year was broadly flat at \u00a3243.1 benefiting slightly from foreign exchange. This performance resulted mainly from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the second half of the year where we saw a reduction in demand, as research labs reduced activity or shut down temporarily.",
         "We continue to serve the needs of laboratories that remained open, but the reduction in demand during the last four months of the year resulted in a 10.5% budget shortfall in catalogue revenues. Within catalogue revenues, in-house products delivered a strong relative performance increasing by 7.4% on a reported basis to \u00a3114 million, or 47% of catalogue revenue.",
         "Including CP&L revenue, total revenue from in-house products and services increased 6.2% on a reported basis to \u00a3131.3 million and represented for the first time over 50% of total revenues. The resilient demand for these products reinforces our underlying basis for organic growth and our growth strategy.",
         "Turning to CP&L. For the first time to aid understand that we\u2019ve broken out CP&L by its component parts. As you can see, CP&L revenue actually comprises three main revenue streams, the custom service business, revenue from the supply of products for in vitro diagnostics used, and royalty and licence income, including milestone payments. Custom services and royalties and licensing revenue lines both grew double digits and we're pleased to see the downstream benefits from the last few years derived - driving royalty growth.",
         "The purchasing delays of IVD products that we experienced in the first half of the year continued into the second half, resulting in a decline in IVD revenue for the year. We continue to build long term relationships with our major IVD customers. And we remain confident in the long term growth potential of this areas of business.",
         "If we could turn to page 14, please. Regionally, all markets were adversely impacted by COVID-19 in our second half. Revenue trends in each country correlated strongly to policy actions taken by governments and organizations around the world in response to the spread of the virus and the resulting partial or full shutdowns and subsequent reopening of academic and biopharmaceutical research laboratories.",
         "The Americas and China saw the greatest impact with 18.4% and 20.5% below the second half of 2019, respectively, and the resulting in declines for full year revenues of 6.7% for the Americas and 1.5% for China.",
         "The EMEA, Japan and the rest of Asia fared much better and overall these regions delivered reported growth of 3.4%, 6.2% and 6.4% for the full year. Across all regions performance gradually improved during the last three months of the year, and we've seen a gradual improvement in activity in the first two months of our new financial year.",
         "Page 15, please. Let's turn to the investments that drive our top line growth. Notwithstanding COVID, we made a fast start to the implementation of our five year plan. We invested approximately \u00a3120 million in acquisitions and external investments during the year to augment our organic plans. Foremost amongst these was the acquisition of the Proteomics and Immunology business of Expedeon for \u20ac120 million or around \u00a3105 million.",
         "We invested an additional \u00a315 million, including integration and acquisition costs across five other smaller transactions, comprising the engineered cell lines and lysates portfolio of EdiGene, the gene-editing platform and oncology product portfolio of Applied Stem Cell's, Marker Gene Technologies, which was an additional component of our conjugation strategy, and two small investments in BrickBio and SomaServe two small private companies.",
         "Despite COVID, we believe the market for deals remains open and we remain very active and actively focused on developing a pipeline of opportunities that meet our acquisition criteria. We also invested over \u00a320 million of OpEx in our own strategic initiatives during the year. Over half of this was on product innovation, R&D and building our new product categories.",
         "In the year our total R&D investment as a percent of our in-house sales, including capitalization, innovation was over 20%. We also invested around \u00a310 million across areas including our commercial transformation and customer experience teams, our data analytics and digital transformation, our global supply chain and our teams.",
         "As Alan earlier mentioned, at the end of June 2020, we had almost 1500 employees, up almost 350 people over the year, including over 80 that joined us through acquisitions.",
         "If you could please turn to page 16. The investments we're making under our five year plan can be seen on this adjusted operating profit bridge. The chart starts with last year's adjusted operating profit of \u00a383.6 million. In fiscal year \u201820, we generated approximately \u00a34 million less of gross profit, \u00a31 million of which was foreign exchange related, with the remainder being a combination of lower IVD revenues, geographic mix and higher fixed costs like shipping during COVID.",
         "From the resulting approximately \u00a380 million, we invested about \u00a325 million back into the business, including approximately \u00a34 million of volume and inflationary-related costs, and approximately \u00a36 million in incremental, depreciation and amortization, reflecting the increased capitalization of product development.",
         "That product development has happened in recent years and as well as the employment of ERP modules and the completion of the UK headquarters. We expect underlying depreciation and amortization to rise a similar amount next year. Non-cash items also included the \u00a36.7 million charge for the impact of IFRS 16.",
         "Please turn to page 17. We continue to be highly cash generative, with cash generated from operations after working capital movements of \u00a365.4 million. Investing activities totaled around \u00a3150 million. This breaks down to just over \u00a3112 spent on acquisitions as previously discussed, and around \u00a336 million on capital expenditures.",
         "CapEx was broadly level with that we saw in 2019. We also invested around \u00a320 million on CapEx relating to new product development. This included the kitting out of new laboratories to support our proteins and cell lines development capabilities, as well as around \u00a39 million of capitalised product development.",
         "We also spent around \u00a314 million on IT programs in the year, the majority of which was on our ERP. We now anticipate the majority of the final modules of our ERP to be deployed in fiscal year \u201821 in a similar capital cost to fiscal year \u201820.",
         "Moving to financing activities. We drew down on the RCF in January to fund the Expedeon acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition, we paid down part of this borrowing before drawing down again in March, following the escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic to provide additional operational flexibility. The balance outstanding at the year end was \u00a3106.4 million, leaving \u00a393 million still undrawn, as well as an accordion option of up to an additional \u00a3100 million.",
         "After proceeds of the \u00a3110 million from the equity issue in April and dividend outflows to shareholders of \u00a325 million during the year, total cash inflows from financing activities was \u00a3184.5 million, resulting in a gross cash position of \u00a3187.3 million at year end.",
         "If you please turn to slide 18. As we discussed during the trading update in July, scientists around the world have continue to adapt their working conditions to COVID-19. The improving trend of activity we saw during the later stages of 2019, \u201820, as shown in this chart has gradually continued in the new fiscal year across our major regions. Nevertheless, given the clear risk around further outbreaks, the potential for reintroduction of more stringent lockdown measures and general lack of visibility and short term outlook, we are not providing full year guidance at this time.",
         "With regard to our longer term outlook and goals, notwithstanding the short term impact of COVID-19, the fundamentals of our business are strong and the long term dynamics of our markets are very attractive. Undoubtedly COVID-19 has brought a level of uncertainty with respect to the near term outlook. However, with that being said, we remain committed to the strategic investment plan we laid out in September 2019 and remain focused on achieving those financial goals.",
         "To further support the group's plans, in July 2020, the board announced its intention to explore secondary listing in the United States. Further to subsequent discussions with an analysis, the board has decided to pursue a potential secondary listing on NASDAQ supplementing the group's existing listing on AIM. The proposed secondary listing is expected to occur in the final calendar quarter of 2020, subject to market and other conditions.",
         "In summary, despite everything that's going on in the world, these remain very exciting times at Abcam. And we continue investing in the business and remain focused on delivering our goals in order to deliver our long term profitable revenue growth. Thank you.",
         "I'll turn it back to Alan to update on our strategic progress in the year."

         "Good afternoon and thank you for joining the Abcam plc\u2019s Preliminary [Technical Difficulty] to Alan Hirzel. Alan, please go ahead."

   "Questionnaire": {
      "1": {
         "Remarks": [
            "[Operator Instructions] So our first question is from James Gordon [JPMorgan] James, Your line is now open."

      },
      "2": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Great, thanks very much for taking the questions. James Gordon from JPMorgan. Two questions, please. One on 2021 and one of the longer term target. So on \u201821, I note the comment on profitability continuing to be suppressed by the effects of COVID-19, and investment plans as well in the short to medium term. So clearly, COVID-19 is pretty hard to predict. And in terms of what's certainly more predictable, on investment plans, so what sort of pace could we see adjusted OpEx grow out for this year? Could it be something like 10% versus teens last year? And any commentary there will be very useful.",
            "And also, just as we do our own forecasts for the top line in \u201821, it was helpful when you talked about gradual improvement in the first two months of the year. Maybe also, if you could say something about how much better August look versus July that would be great for me. So that was the first question.",
            "And the second question, the 2024 target. So there have been clearly some challenges from COVID-19. And also you're investing a bit more but on track to hit the \u201824 target, which I think would mean something like a 40% CAGR in EBIT from \u201821 to \u201824.",
            "So the question is just, is there anything that - as well as some of the challenges, things are going better and that's why you think you're going to see this sort of inflection even faster growth in the later years than you previously expected? Or was it any conservatism in the previous target? And how much M&A are you expecting to contribute to the \u201824 number as well? Thanks a lot."
         ],
         "Speaker": "James Gordon"

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Thank you, James. Why don\u2019t I hit on the first one and the Alan, can mix it up on the other two. It's - as we said, in the RNS and we'll repeat. As I said, we aren't giving guidance this year, it's impossible for us to predict what's going on with COVID. And what we can tell you, not by quantum, as we don't get monthly numbers, but that the trend that we saw in the last few months is continuing, so you can read into that what you want.",
            "It's looking - it's continuing to look better. But as you know, given what's going on around the world right now, predicting that on a day to day basis is pretty dangerous. We just can't do that. So we can't give you any guidance on the revenue or COVID front.",
            "On the OpEx side, I guess what I would say is that we are going to continue to push forward the investments that we've talked about. And that's both organic and inorganic, as we acquire some of these. As we make some of these acquisitions, we'll continue to pump in capital to make sure that we maximize the use of those technologies we're borrowing.",
            "And I wouldn't be surprised if the trend continues that we're seeing in revenues for us to really put our foot down on the pedal to increase - increasing costs, to bring in the teams and make sure we exploit the five year growth plan that we talked about, so that we have a greater level of certainty in making an exceeding the plans the numbers that we laid out for you before."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah, I'll just add. I'll say exactly what I said back in November, that we see tremendous opportunities for growth in research using antibodies, and the related applications in the adjacent markets that I've talked about. And the big question we had when we were launching the strategy was, could we get started fast enough? Not because we were constrained on capital, but could we get started with putting the right people in the right areas fast enough in order to deliver that.",
            "And I said a couple times, part of our confidence here in the out years revenue is we're putting the investment to work at great pace behind good ideas and good people. And we like what we're seeing so far. Those are goals. And we have goals then for how the next few years unfold.",
            "And, you know, we back ourselves, we sort of like the feedback we're getting from market from the products we launched. And we like to extend that the markets return to some kind of normal demand and activities in labs, we like our chances of how we can compete in these marketplaces. That all that said, you're right that, you know, we're a year on, and our starting point is the same as what it was last year.",
            "So I think all of us, we haven't lost the objective in terms of the target. We think it's absolutely possible, provided there's no major shocks and how science is done and that people get back into labs, and that they try - continue to try these products that we're developing. It's absolutely positive. You know, we're absolutely confident in the 450 to 500 revenue target.",
            "I also said in terms of margins of the business and where we'd be, it would depend on a couple of things. One, that original plan was a no acquisitions plan. We bought a lot of things this year, that didn't come with a lot of revenue. So we've got to think about how that impacts the shape of the P&L.",
            "And the reality is we always reserve the right as long as the economics look good for investing in long term growth, the business to invest. Because margins are high for our own products, we're going to invest in our own products, return on capital is high. So I think people get a little worked up about particular margin targets. We don't run the business for margins and target. What we're trying to do is build a company that's capable of delivering 450 to 500 revenue over the next few years and we're absolutely confident as possibility how COVID effects the exact phasing of margins exactly what we do on that I, I don't think we should be speculating on at this point. But we'll be happily giving people updates along the way."

I'm just wondering if you could give us a run rate of the number of projects that you're completing and licensing deals that you're completing per year, please.",
            "And on the IVD line, you - obviously, that performed significantly. It sounds like you think that's temporary. Is that expected to rebound this year? That's the first question. "

      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, let me let me tackle the IVD first. The in vitro diagnostics revenue portfolio has a couple of things going on. So one, there's a handful of big customers who buy. And the one customer that we had - that had the biggest impact over the last year was a carve-out of a larger company that's been set up as independent business. And the conversations we're having with them are good. And we're optimistic about them returning to normal demand relationship. But most of that IVD impact was due to that one situation.",
            "But the other thing that's going on here is sometimes revenue that will show up in vitro diagnostic line will be a part of a supply agreement, which is temporary. And if that revenue can slip over into a out license arrangement, so that moves from one line there to the royalties and licenses line. And we judge that as a good thing whenever it happens.",
            "So I think when we look at these three split out, one of the reasons why I've been reluctant to split them out is you're going to find stuff bounces around. That the project revenue probably will be more often than not trending around mean of zero percent growth, because that's kind of how we're planning for it.",
            "So some years it might be down, some years it might be up, but we're not trying to do a lot more projects, I\u2019ll come back to your question on projects. And the most important growth areas in licensing and royalties, and the supply agreements with IVD can be an intermediate to that.",
            "In terms of the number of projects, they vary, obviously, depending on the size of the project and scale, but I don't have to do the math for you to divide the 2000 by the number of years, roughly the run rate and this you can all do that for yourselves. But this you know, COVID did have an impact on the initiation of new projects and the ability to deliver to customers because they weren't in labs, some of these projects. So we did see a little bit of a slowdown in the second half on customer projects."

I just wondered if you could give us any further color on what you've been particularly pleased with. And from a gross margin perspective, do these have a similar gross margin characteristic to your recombinant antibodies?"

We had launched by the time you guys were doing the tour in November, we had already had a pilot scale production protein plan. We've now expanded that into the US at more scale.",
            "And in a world where everybody was looking for spike protein for COVID, that's certainly created a bunch of opportunities for us to do develop the products with customers. But it wasn't just by protein, there were some other COVID-related proteins that were relevant and allowed us to cut our teeth on those, whilst we were launching the products that we already thought we were going to be putting into market.",
            "So I think the uptake on proteins is been good, we're happy with that. The cell lines lysates cells, it's really small, but we're starting to learn a lot about who's buying and why and what the repeat rate of those are. All these are little seedlings and its basically year end or less is not enough yet to call it as victory, but the most important thing is we saw growth across all of them and they were all doing better than we had expected, but small."

The first step to getting there is to replace the 21 year old technology with something that's more flexible, as it allows us to get there and that's the process we're going to be undertaking in this year.

So firstly just on COVID and sort of addressable markets and you sort of reiterated your confidence in the research you\u2019re seeing [ph] in markets, but I guess one of the things that we've seen and at the COVID-19 pandemic, et cetera, has been just some sheer importance of having, you know, diagnostic approvals and just a world of difference between the revenue that can be earned for the [indiscernible] emergency approved diagnostics versus research-use only, and I guess the regulatory barriers come down. So have you guys just thought about, you know, moving into that as an addressable market, because it's just sort of strikes me as sort of immediately addressing and a very large segment."

            "Hi, Stefan. Yes, early on one of the questions we posed to ourselves was, should Abcam can be a more COVID company. And should we pivot our strategy to do more COVID focused work or not. And you can see where we've come out on that. Basically, our job, as we see it, is to make great tools and components for people who are going to make those diagnostics, but not compete with them, and not to lose sight of what our overall mission is, which is to serve all of life science, not just COVID.",
            "So we have not gone down the route some other companies have gone, which is to create our own route antibody tests and other things, because that's not us. And our worry was doing that would not only compete with our customers, but would distract us from the agenda which is going to drive the price. And infectious disease in particular is a bit risky, because there'll be a day when all these COVID products don't have any market, because something will else come along.",
            "So you know, we've decided not to pursue that route. We basically took our strategy and said, the world's going to get through this and we're going to be Abcam the only folks we've made is where our products are relevant or where customers have need we're spending a lot of time with them, but we're not trying to compete with them."

I guess that's going to rely on M&A from what I can see. And we've seen the AxioMx impairment in the year. Can you just comment on how Fireplex is going and just how things like the impairments are going to be addressed within your ROCE target? Thank you."

It was an impairment of some very specific intangibles tied to the use of phage [ph] for manufacturing, and in the end, we've continued to use it for many things, but we're scaling up. You know, the RabMAb manufacturing that were doing continue to be the best way forward for us.",
            "So there's a point at which in time that accountants decide that we should write off some of those intangibles, but in no way impacts the benefits and some of the talent and technology we got out of AxioMx. And you know, we will \u2013 it will be incorporated into our return on capital, it obviously doesn't become a part of the current calculation, but you know, it will be calculated, as we've written it off."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah, look the point of Fireplex, is a little bit similar to the AxioMx. We bought Fireplex when it was a microRNA analytics technology in the early stages of development. What we thought was the opportunity with it was not to use it for that, but to use it for antibodies and now the development of that is large - is complete.",
            "So we have some high throughput, mid-plex and larger plex immunoassays on Fireplex. And we've got some customer relationships that are beginning to use that and asking the CROs to use it. It's got to prove itself, it's still relatively small scale rest to the Abcam. And it's part of the story over the next few years. So I can't say much more about it than that.",
            "But from a kind of competitive performance as a product and technology, the feedback we've gotten is very strong, not only from our customers but from competitors. So we like Fireplex and where it is at the moment from a technical development. Now, the commercial - commercialization is what lies ahead at scale."

Just a couple related to the helpful slides you put on slide 18 - or charts, just to get a bit of - a bit more of a sense maybe for current trading. I know you've said it's largely in-line, but just to see what you can comment on more on July and August. Is it more sort of flat? You obviously got sort of almost flat at the end of June. Because the chart, the second chart, was in terms of lab activity. It looks like a bit of a snapshot from sort of from August suggests 70% were either shut down or partially operating, I mean, roughly, I guess, on an overall basis. 30% are fully operational, so how - if you're still flat despite that level of activity.

So I think that chart on page 18, at the bottom in terms of lab activity ought to give all of us the same cautious perspective on trying to call anything because you rightly point out that even as the first couple weeks of August, the majority of labs were not yet fully operational. And even today, that's still true.",
            "So what does it mean to be partially operational is an interesting question. And we're still trying to figure out how does that affect demand. But, you know, part of the, I guess the whole reason here is that, particularly the US and the UK are well behind their normal levels of activity based on these kinds of analysis, whether using in this case, we're using third party or our own analysis we know, labs are struggling to get back. And so that's where we are.",
            "I - to extend we start talking about month-by-month now, I'm sure we're going to be dragged into talking about month-by-month for next six months. I just asked you to hold until we see the results in the first half and then we can all talk about what the profile was.

At six, seven years of work, where we still feel like there's tons of opportunity, and so these things take time.",

I mean, it sort of gets to the point in terms of the number of products and number of projects that it's so many that I can't just talk about any one of them, I got to talk about categorically. So on the kind of partnerships that we've got in place, I mentioned a few of those, if you just take the COVID example, to have 30 clinical collaborations where we're working on either screening for drug candidates or providing antibodies, it could become drug candidates or we're just helping design the diagnostic. Those kinds of things that we're doing at Abcam today couldn't be done at Abcam before we started investing in its capabilities four or five years ago.",
            "The benefits of this kind of reputation and the ability to deliver are helping create more and more opportunities every day. And we're very excited about the progress we're making, as a company and the number that I think is in the annual report is around 50% of our revenue now in the catalogue from our own products. It's as a company its well over 50% that's moving very quickly. And so Michael talked about our own products continuing to grow. They're continuing to grow because they're better products. They're more targeted to the relevant areas. We're doing a better job getting them into Abcam inside applications. And that's the strategy. They are going to be more of that."
