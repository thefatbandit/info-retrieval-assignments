      "John Turner": [
         "Thank you, Leslie. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I would like to open by saying that all of us at GMS hope everyone joining this call as well as your families and colleagues are safe and well. I will start with a review of our operating highlights and then turn it over to Scott who will cover our financial results. I will then share some closing thoughts before taking your questions.",
         "If you turn to Slide 3, our first quarter results reflect outstanding execution by our entire team against the backdrop of a business environment that clearly demanded \u2013 excuse me that clearly remains challenging throughout the period. As a result of the economic impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, net sales and organic net sales declined 5.3% and 5.7% respectively. Despite the lower sales, we generated higher net income and higher adjusted net income. Furthermore, we improved both gross and adjusted EBITDA margins by 20 and 40 basis points respectively. These improvements were the direct result of the rapid alignment of our cost structure to current demand, our balanced product and market mix, which has been strengthened through the execution of our growth initiatives and a relentless focus on serving our customers with operational excellence.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA of $83.1 million was 10.3% of sales, reflecting a decremental adjusted EBITDA margin of just 1.4%. This was significantly better than the 10% to 20% outlook we had provided in our fourth quarter call as a result of better than anticipated gross margin performance, coupled with our proactive and disciplined stance toward cost containment and alignment in the current environment. On the health and safety front, we maintained enhanced operating protocols in compliance with public health requirements, recommendations, and guidelines aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and the health and safety of our employees, business partners, and communities remains our top priority. All of us at GMS express our gratitude to those who have been and continue to be on the frontlines everyday during these unprecedented times.",
         "Considering the environment in which we are operating, we are off to a strong start to fiscal 2021. My congratulations and thanks go out to the entire GMS team who made these results possible remaining engaged, focused, and proactive as we come together in support of our customers and each other. At the same time, I offer our gratitude for the partnership we share with both our customers and suppliers who have faced their own difficult challenges in navigating the realities of the current market.",
         "With that, I will now turn it over to Scott to provide some more perspective on our financial results for Q1. Scott?",
         "Thanks, Scott. Turning to Slide 7, while we continue to carefully monitor and address market developments, we remain committed to our strategic growth initiatives, which guide our long-term management of a very attractive business with significant long-term growth potential. As a reminder, our growth priorities include, expanding share in our core products, particularly in geographies where we are under-penetrated, growing select other product opportunities outside of core products to diversify and profitably expand our product offering, developing the platform through accretive acquisition and greenfield opportunities while maintaining balanced progress in debt reduction, and leveraging our scale and employing technology and best practices to deliver a best-in-class customer experience as well as increased productivity and further profit improvement.",
         "In terms of acquisitions and new market expansion, we have returned to an active stance in pursuing deals and in advancing our Greenfield expansion. Near-term, we are realizing benefits from the execution of all of these strategies, which have equipped us with not only meaningful scale and technology advantages, but with balanced product, geographic and end market portfolios, all of which should serve to enhance our performance in this current environment. For example, growing share in our core products in under-penetrated geographies is increasing our scale advantages. Focused emphasis on our offering of other complementary products enabled us to grow that segment of our business this quarter, despite the challenging environment and further diversifies and balances our product portfolio. Platform expansion from both acquisitions and greenfield locations has not only enhanced our scale, but is also provided further product, end market and geographic diversification, including market leadership across both the US and Canada. Technology deployments such as our e-commerce and fleet optimization and logistic software, has enabled us to not only better serve our customers, but to achieve increased productivity through operational excellence.",
         "Finally, since our last update to you in June, current external forecast remained varied with respect to both residential and commercial construction. The outlook for residential construction has improved. On the other hand, consensus forecast for commercial activity are little changed and still suggest a difficult environment. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we do anticipate further commercial weakness from what we experienced in the first quarter. Moreover, there is also one less selling day in Q2 of this year than last year. This is expected to present a more challenging year-over-year second quarter sales comparison to what was an all-time quarterly record last year.",
         "In terms of profitability, the year-over-year gross margin comparison which was 33% in Q2 of last year will be more difficult than was the case in the first quarter. Taking these factors into consideration, we believe it prudent to targeted decremental adjusted EBITDA margin within the range of 10% to 20% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. With the expectation that we will see some benefit from improved residential start numbers in our third and fourth quarters, we are optimistic that year-over-year sales comparisons should be less challenged in the back half of our fiscal year.",
         "As we conclude, our focus remains on controlling what we can. We have taken, and intend to continue to take the necessary actions to optimize our operations and align our business with demand. I am confident in our team\u2019s ability to continue to address challenges and leverage opportunities quickly and nimbly. We firmly believe the foundation we have built at GMS coupled with our strong liquidity and ability to generate cash, healthy balance sheet, market leadership and ongoing commitment to our strategic growth priorities positions us well for the duration of this period and for long-term success.",
         "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

         "Greetings and welcome to GMS Inc. First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin."

      "Scott Deakin": [
         "Thanks, JT. Good morning. Looking at Slide 4 of our deck, net sales were $802.6 million, down 5.3% year-over-year as continued COVID-19 related market declines in the U.S. were partially offset by higher sales in Canada. Overall, organic net sales declined 5.7%. Wallboard sales of $328 million decreased 4% or 4.1% on an organic basis, principally due to a decline in both price and mix driven mostly by a share to a greater weighting of residential wallboard products and to a lesser extent, lower volumes, which were down only about 1% on a consolidated basis.",
         "Ceiling sales of $113.7 million decreased 11.9% or 12.5% on an organic basis, driven by lower volumes and product mix partially offset by higher pricing. Steel framing sales of $110.5 million decreased 16.2% or 16.4% on an organic basis, primarily due to a decline in both volumes and pricing, partially offset by product mix. The deflationary environment in steel continued in the quarter with pricing down approximately 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Year-over-year sales declines were more pronounced in ceilings and steel, product categories tied primarily to commercial construction activity, given the relatively more challenged demand environment there versus residential. Residential, while still down year-over-year continued to improve during the quarter and into August. Complementary other product sales of $250.4 million increased 2.3% or 1.5% on an organic basis due to positive contributions from acquisitions, execution of our strategic growth initiatives, and positive organic growth in Canada. Gross profit of $260.5 million decreased 4.8%, primarily due to the lower sales. Gross margin of 32.5% improved 20 basis points as a result of favorable product mix and purchasing initiatives, given a higher proportion of sales in both wallboard and other products.",
         "Turning to Slide 5, adjusted SG&A expense as a percent of net sales of 22.2% improved 40 basis points. This despite a 50-basis-point headwind from the deflationary market pricing of wallboard and steel, approximately 90 basis points of improvement were realized as a direct result of the proactive measures to defer or limit non-essential operating and other discretionary expenses as we aligned the company\u2019s cost structure with the current demand environment as well as favorable business mix towards single-family residential with respect to operating costs. All considered, first quarter adjusted EBITDA in dollar terms declined marginally to $83.1 million from $83.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin, however, improved 40 basis points to 10.3%. This represented a 1.4% decremental adjusted EBITDA margin. We were very pleased that our execution in the first quarter generated improved profit margins over both the prior year and against our previous expectations for the first fiscal quarter despite the market-related decline in sales.",
         "Turning to Slide 6, as is typical during our first quarter of the fiscal year, we generated a use of cash from operating activities and free cash. These totaled $15.7 million and $20.5 million respectively increasing only modestly compared to the prior year despite our tempering some of the precautionary cash management measures we put in place in the fourth quarter. For the second fiscal quarter, we anticipate generating a robust level of positive free cash flow, which is typical of our normal quarterly cadence. Capital expenditures of $4.7 million or $1.1 million lower year-over-year as we had delayed or reduced capital expenditures that were not anticipated to impact near-term business. This said, looking forward, we maintain our estimate for cash capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 of approximately $25 million.",
         "As of July 31, 2020, we had cash on hand of $139.7 million and $372.5 million of available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities. You will recall that as a precautionary measure to increase cash on hand and financial flexibility at the start of the pandemic, we drew down approximately $87 million under our revolving credit facilities during the quarter, excuse me, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. During quarter one, we repaid approximately $44 million of these borrowings and repaid the remainder of this precautionary draw in August. Our net leverage was 3x as of the end of the first quarter, relatively consistent with 2.9x as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and compared to 3.7x as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and in terms of the overall stability of our capital structure, the large majority of our debt is not due until 2025.",

You are seeing the mix in ceilings and steel, and we expect that to continue. We are very happy with our other product category performance in spite of commercial weakness, and we don\u2019t see any reason why that shouldn\u2019t continue. And so, in general, I think that what we have \u2013 what we were able to do here in the quarter, I see the trends continuing."

         "Remarks": [
            "So first, I want to maybe see if you can expand on your comment about expecting or may be seeing further commercial weakness. So, ceilings and steel organic volume both down double digits and taking out the impact of one less day, is that to mean that you\u2019re expecting a deceleration from that level that we saw in 1Q, is that \u2013 and anymore color you can give us around that comment?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Trey Grooms"
      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much different than we talked about last quarter, although it\u2019s becoming more clear now that commercial is certainly going to be weaker as we move through the balance of the calendar year and likely won\u2019t strengthen until we get into later in calendar 2021. On the other hand, I think I was accused of being somewhat bullish on the residential side after the last call, and I think I am probably more excited about it now than I was then. So, I think that offset as we mentioned here in our comments is likely to happen later in the year as we get \u2013 as we begin to roll over these starts numbers that are happening as we speak. But the degree of those offsets to what is, yes, it continued deceleration of steel and ceiling expected deceleration of steel and ceiling. I can\u2019t tell you the degree of that deceleration really out much further than we\u2019re operating right now, but I would expect it to slightly deteriorate through Q2. And then we will get on the phone again, and we will talk about Q3 when we have a little bit better visibility into it."

And with the SG&A leverage that you guys achieved and Scott, you mentioned a few things that were drivers there, but you also mentioned the headwind there that you had, the 50 basis points headwind on from price. What is your thoughts around SG&A, the kind of sustainability there, at least for the leverage or with, when you have got volumes that are probably going to be challenged on one side of the business in 2Q, wallboard volumes might not be as good as what we can see later just given the timing and the lag with starts, how . How should we be thinking about the SG&A side of things?"

We have been able to flex wages, labor, materials, repairs, those types of things really well. As you look forward into the G&A side of things, I think we are really disciplined there, obviously we would expect to maintain what we are doing on things like travel, entertainment, meetings, all of those kinds of things, the more truly discretionary kinds of things that we will be doing. So maintenance there is going to be important to us. And I got a key part of the way that we run the business into the quarter, obviously, as you indicated, though, we do have some softer revenues, in terms of the air cover to that, the net of that is that we don\u2019t expect a whole lot of leverage go into the next quarter. But we should be pretty solid just in terms of our ability to weather this sales decline in that environment."

And if I could just sneak one more in, on the housing comment earlier, JT that you made around, it was down in the quarter, volume was down, kind of residential volume was down in the quarter, but that it -- it did improve and any more color you can give us on that? It was \u2013 it sounded like it improved through the quarter and into August. Are you kind of in the positive territory there yet? And it sounds like it\u2019s expected to ramp up even further as we get through this quarter, but just any more color on the trajectory?"

Currently, I think that that trend, I mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine that trend isn\u2019t going to continue and eventually flip to positive with the starts numbers that we have seen. So if we could \u2013 if we could get another 3 to 6 months of robust starts numbers, obviously what they start, they will finish for the most part residentially and we will be supplying it. So, I think we remain positive in that trend."

Additionally Canada had gone through a housing slump prior to COVID. And the demand remains pent up and I think that you are seeing some snapback coming out of COVID. I don\u2019t know how long that might last. But we certainly see good near-term trends in Canada and our team up there has done a very, very good job of positioning us to be ready to capitalize in this moment.

So when we talk about one of our growth initiatives being stronger in our core product mix, it\u2019s being \u2013 it\u2019s becoming balanced everywhere. And not by shrinking one category, but becoming stronger in the other category. So I think, acquisition wise, the reality of that is, it\u2019s pretty much white space related and, but, yes, obviously we would, we think that the ability to service residential is very important to us going forward, particularly in the near-term and so acquisitions in and around that makes sense."

At least we have 6 to 8 identified greenfields, all good markets, all complementary opportunities for us to expand where we already have a presence. So that strategy is going to continue. What we closed were basically operations that through different acquisitions and legacy things, didn\u2019t make sense in the near-term, so just a couple of those. Acquisitions, our pipeline was good before COVID, and we paused it, and now we have un-paused it, and the pipeline is good post COVID.

For us, I hope most of the commercial forecasts are showing down 8, 9, 10 for the year, some of them in low-double digits, some of them at 5. So, it\u2019s kind of all over the board, but you get that consensus into that 8, 9. I think we are kind of in the heart of it, in that regard. But I do think, if you look at the July numbers, if the July starts numbers were to repeat, and then in August, and then in September we start seeing those kinds of numbers. Then you \u2013 our Q3 and our Q4 will be \u2013 will be much better than otherwise that\u2019s for sure."

The 10% to 20% I would have thought with the outperformance this quarter that, that would come in slightly above that range. So I was just curious to get your thoughts on some of the moving pieces there and whether, some of the cost take out you saw on SG&A comes back in the quarter or is there some other one-time item that we should be aware of in terms of that, just looking to this."

All of it is challenged, I mean, the pipeline we are doing for the most part is a lot of new and a lot of remodel that have already started. So the traditional refit and office refit, and those types of activities that we would be doing in this \u2013 in this normal busy time of the years that\u2019s not happening. So I think both are equally challenged quite frankly at the moment. I don\u2019t \u2013 I think longer term, you will start to see some remodel come back and I think that as people really come back to work and occupy office space will start to see some \u2013 some pickup in that. But with that \u2013 with hospitality, restaurant and office being as challenged as they are, those are all robust remodel type markets, it\u2019s just not happening at the moment."
