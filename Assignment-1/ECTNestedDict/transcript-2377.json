      "Alexandre M\u00e9rieux": [
         "Thank you, Sylvain. Hello to all. Thank you for joining this call. So, I will start with a snapshot on the takeaway messages from H1 performance. As you know, since the beginning of the crisis bioM\u00e9rieux is at the forefront of the fight against COVID. bioM\u00e9rieux has delivered well on our mission by developing comprehensive range of diagnostic solutions and you can see that during H1 the strong performance was driven by very strong demand for molecular, strong growth of around 16% -- 15.7% in H1, so nice increase, and also increase in term of profitability to reach around 17% EBITDA during H1.",
         "I will move to next slide. So you see that we got comprehensive range of solution, both in the field of molecular, field of serology and immunoassay. Looking at the molecular front, we have available extraction with EMAG and easy MAG. We developed the PCR test, [monocyte] test with the ARGENE solutions. And also we have now the syndromic test with RP2.1 in the U.S. and RP2.1plus for Europe and the rest of the world.",
         "Also for serology, end of June, I believe that we have -- we delivered -- we launched the test for VIDAS, bothon IgM and also on IgG. So quite a complete range of solutions coming from the portfolio of bioM\u00e9rieux.",
         "Since the beginning of the crisis, we kept the same priorities. The first one is to ensure safety of our employees. Second one is to ensure business continuity. So, regarding employees, we ensure that -- their sanitary safety I would say, but took care of them more socially and also you see that the Board of Directors have decided to allocate half of dividend of 2019 to support solidarity actions. Part of this will go to the M\u00e9rieux Foundation which is very active in emerging countries and the Foundation has redirected part of its program to fight COVID-19. And also significant amount also will be allocated to support local initiatives in the countries where bioM\u00e9rieux is operating.",
         "So, you have seen also an impressive regarding molecular biology in general but more particular for BIOFIRE which displayed a growth of 60% in the first semester with an installed base moving from 10,400 instruments to 14,000 new units worldwide, 80% of the business being done in the U.S. and 20% outside of the U.S. So we see a strong demand for the test, mainly for RP2.1 knowing that it is a very adequate test in the current context and it will be very adequate for the upcoming flu season where there it would be critical to detect, identify between what type of virus is impacting the population in the flu season. We are ramping up our manufacturing capacity, not only in molecular but this is also -- this is in Salt Lake. And you see that in June, we have been able to put in place or to operate on another site for the production of FILMARRAY pouches -- working for -- so we\u2019re working to improve the capacity and production.",
         "So, strong demand surge in molecular but it is quite contracted also regarding clinical applications outside of molecular, mainly in the field of microbiology and also immunoassay. We have seen in the first six months overall reduced hospital traffic with less patients going into the hospital. So, we have seen a decline of sales on the ranges such as VITEK,BACT/ALERT and immunoassay, which is, I would say consistent with what we see also outside in the world with other competitors.",
         "Looking at the field of industrial applications, which represents 15% of bioM\u00e9rieux business at the end of June. Basically, remember, there\u2019s been 1% growth. Pharma remains solid but in the food business we have been impacted by the fact that the catering services and the restaurants were not able to work. So we had an impact on this with less testing coming from these two sectors.",
         "With this short introduction, I leave the floor to Guillaume for the financial results.",
         "Thank you, Guillaume. So, you see that under difficult circumstances bioM\u00e9rieux has delivered a strong performance in H1. It\u2019s true the market --there is still a lot of uncertainties linked to COVID around the world. So we prefer not to issue any new annual guidance as of this date. So, we have to follow and monitor the evolution of the market and bioM\u00e9rieux even as we say we are on a good trend.",
         "With this, if it\u2019s okay with you, we can open the floor to questions."
      ],
      "Guillaume Bouhours": [
         "Thank you, Alexandre. So let's review our financial performance in H1. Total sales growth of 15.8%, no major FX effects, actually neutral in H1, no scope effect either. Just to mention that when looking at H2,with evaluation of USD recently, I think the effects on the revenues and also operational profit will be more negative from foreign exchange impact, just to keep in mind. For H2",
         "So let\u2019s review now the 15.7% organic growth of H1 by range and putting that by geography. Well, this shows actually the translation in financial terms of all the trends that Alexandre just explained. So the -- especially the reduced traffic in hospitals impacted microbiology with minus 4% in H1 and impacted even more immunoassay with minus 14%.We have let\u2019s say a mix in immunoassay of partly routine in the portfolio more impacted and partly more let\u2019s say emergency type slightly less impacted.",
         "Molecular, very impressive. We just saw the BIOFIRE figure. Adding the ARGENE and extraction we get to plus 69% growth and actually you have to add potentially the molecular BioFire Defense, which is gray, there 3% on top to get to actually the plus 80% organic growth of molecular that is mentioned in the press release. And industry already commented by Alexandre, that pretty solid on pharma, much more impacted on food and overall 1% growth organic for H1.",
         "Now looking at the same by let\u2019s say region. The main comment is actually that the region trends let\u2019s say mirror reflect our exposure or penetration of molecular in the different markets. So obviously Americas is where we have the best positions in molecular with huge success of BIOFIRE, so overall 30% growth. On the other side, Asia Pacific is probably the region where the weight of molecular is least at this stage, and therefore most impacted by the H1 context with only 2% growth. And EMEA is somewhere in the middle with slightly better exposure and position of BIOFIRE and molecular than in Asia Pacific and therefore higher growth of 4.5%.",
         "Now coming to the P&L. So we just commented the first line of sales. Gross profit you can see is slightly decreasing percentage wise from 55.7 to 55.3. There are two, I\u2019ll call it, external factors which is FX, slightly negative, and also the phantom share impact. With share price increase we had to provision more of the phantom shares bonus. When we exclude those two effects in gross profit, actually the percentage is flat year-over-year and this flat percentage includes I would say mix effect, positive on one side for the FILMARRAY growth having again a positive effect and negative on the other side with the stronger equipment sales. And as we usually mention, of course, equipments have lower margin on sales. So that's, the different effects for the gross margin.",
         "Then SG&A is up 8% on an organic basis. You will see that it's a much lower than sales trend but also much lower than our usual trend which used to be double-digits. Of course, we have there a lot of savings in the lock down period in the different regions on the less travel, less congress, less promotion on the commercial front.",
         "R&D is up 12%.So that reflect of course all the COVID-19 developments, specific developments that we had in Q1 and Q2 but also an effort to maintain as much as we could the pace of innovation for the rest of the business. So, all in, margin and operating -- current operating margin contributed at 17%,17.1% and up organic wise 32%.",
         "Just to mention on the next page are some exceptional that you might want to look at differences. So, included in this operating margin, the U.S. pension. So we finalized in June the termination of U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Scheme. So, it had, if you remember, a positive effect last year of 10 million or 11 million in H1 and negative -- minus 4 million in H1 this year, so year-on-year it's variation of minus 14 million. That's one effect. Now this operation is done, it was over two years. And we have let's say the usual 401(k) for all of our employees in the U.S. now.",
         "And the second effect is of course phantom share plan. I\u2019ll remind everyone this is a special scheme of long-term incentive bonus, linked -- where the amounts are linked to the share price of bioM\u00e9rieux and this scheme will end in Q1 -- end of Q1 2021, so next year. So, we have -- of course there\u2019s huge increase of the share price, pretty significant expense provision for phantom shares, 42 million in H1 this year compared to 26 million last year, so this is variation of minus16 million. And a final point to mention here, minus 7 million on FX. So overall with some emerging currencies especially that devaluated in Q1.",
         "To comment on the next slide between contributive operating income and net income. So, we have our usual BIOFIRE acquisition-related costs. Amortization flat, \u20ac18 million per year, \u20ac9 million for the H1.Special line that is new and mentioned by Alexandre, the willingness and decision by the Board to support solidarity initiatives for let's say half of the dividend. So we already booked 12 million on this, the Foundation value amount in H1. It will be -- overall for the year it will be 22 million in this line and these are let's say special actions are considered as non-recurring. So that's why they are classified here.",
         "Net financial expense improved slightly to 12 million expense and the tax rate was at 22%, I will comment on next slide. But overall net income, Group share \u20ac173 million and up 23% all included.",
         "A quick comment on the tax rate.So we ended just below 22% effective tax rate. We have of course, the major effect of our mix of countries especially pretty significant exposure on the U.S. profits with lower tax rate than France. Just to mention the sponsorship. So this 12 million let\u2019s say solidarity actions funding has a slight impact, let\u2019s say, positive, to reduce to 21.7, reduction of 0.6 non-recurring.",
         "Let's now look at the cash flow. So, pretty strong cash flow, free cash flow generation 144 million compared to 55 million last year for H1. Of course, the third driver is operating profits, pretty strong. Working capital was at only 22 million overall. But still inside this 22 million, a very significant increase of inventory, due to slower sales in microbiology and immunoassay where let\u2019s say the adjustments of production with the lack of visibility was difficult to grow at the same pace, a really good level of collection and AR and days of sales. We also slightly accelerated -- and we wanted to accelerate our payment to vendors. And included there a positive effect of PSOP as we provisioned more than we cashed out.",
         "In the free cash flow also let's say sustained level of investment, as you can see 127 million, 9% of sales. It includes of course the new manufacturing capacity for BIOFIRE and the new plan that Alexandre showed. But not only, we also invest in the rest of the industrial sector. We also invest in this amount, I remind everyone on the installed base with all the placements that are considered as CapEx.",
         "With this strong free cash flow, our net debt decreased to 192 million, so a pretty significant decrease to very low 0.3 times leverage. And just to mention that we refinanced our 2013bond coming due in October. We had 200 million private placement EuroPP 8-year maturity, so pretty long, for a better diversity of our financing maturity and 1.6%, pretty successful transaction.",
         "And with that, I hand it back to Alexandre for the outlook."

First of all, our press release was published this morning at 7:00 AM. This press release can be found in the Investors section of our website, www.biomerieux.com. In addition, please note that the slides of this meeting are also available and they can be downloaded directly from the webcast. So, promptly, after the end of the meeting, the webcast and the call will be available in replay on our website.",

            "Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have three, if I may. So first would be, if you could just talk us through the exit rates that you saw on your base business in Augustin both Europe and U.S. that would be helpful? Then secondly, we\u2019ve seen rapid flow antigen test from Abbott and also from Roche. If you could just help us understand where you see that test getting into the general COVID testing landscape and if you are interested in expanding in that space? And then finally, on the increase in BIOFIRE placements, I still see in the slides that an ex-U.S. increase in the installed base is a key priority. How then should we think about additional investments in selling and marketing and advertising in 2021 to get back on that agenda?"

         "Remarks": [
            "In August, oh, okay. I'm not sure we mention this. No, as you can see, yes, the work in testing has been impacted, I believe it continues to be. We\u2019re not back to what we can call normal, but we are monitoring in this situation. So the trend has not completely reversed yet. For immunoassay, we have launched end of June test for VIDAS COVID. It\u2019s a bit early to say. It\u2019s a slow ramp up.It\u2019s a bit early to comment at this stage.",
            "Regarding your question around Abbott new test, on the upcoming potential Roche new test, difficult for me to comment especially, I would say it's good to have more players coming with more solutions because there is a strong demand for test, and the impact of test all over the world. Today the standard is PCR, but it\u2019s a different technology. So let\u2019s wait and see. I don't believe it will have too much of an impact on bioM\u00e9rieux since most of our growth on a push and demand is coming for syndromic testing, which is different. And the idea is to have a comprehensive view of all the potential viruses and bacteria involved in this COVID disease. And I missed the third question. Guillaume, you have the\u2026?"

And yes, pharma -- I think the second part of the question was on the additional investment, sales and marketing investment to continue to expand the BIOFIRE base customer in 2021, that\u2019s something we will continue to invest. We will continue to invest as we mentioned. It's our strategy in the -- outside of the U.S. expansion and market share gain and new customers for BIOFIRE."

Also, the new installed bases that we've had in the U.S. and elsewhere, I presume a lot of that is linked to COVID testing. Can you just talk us through the contracts that those new placements have? Do you have specific volume agreements into 2021 for tests on those machines that aren't COVID related?"

What we can say today is that the demand is super high and we are even struggling to deliver at the level of the demand that we see. Yes, so it's more subject to supply in the market. Also referring to what Alexandre said that it\u2019s good to have test with such a huge demand overall."

            "Hi, Hello, thanks for taking the question. I have one on the guidance that you've for 2020. Just wondering, if we should extrapolate the sustainable impact on financials in H2 from the base of H1 \u201820, meaning organic growth of 16% or from the base that you had in the second quarter i.e. growth of 10%? And also on the maintained pace of innovation that you had with the level of R&D at above 10% of sales. Could you remind us of the upcoming launch season product that you have in the pipeline and if you've seen any delays here?Thanks."

      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. For the level of R&D, as we mentioned, we primarily invest in R&D. But this year we have focused our results both on ARGENE on the extraction and also on syndromic and to be able to deliver in a few weeks an improved level. Also immunoassay was not planned in our budget. So we invested to deliver this -- develop this test. In terms of potential delays compared to what we announced, I think, yes, maybe on immunoassay, I think some -- there will be some delays on the tests that were announced such as TB-IGRA on the -- because the clinical trials have been a bit postponed or slowed down during the COVID crisis. So, this is, I would say, mainly -- compared to what we know this is mainly in that space that we see some delay.",
            "Your first question is on the guidance of 2020, but we don't give a guidance. So, cannot give you more details on that.There is strong -- the demand for molecular is very strong. But as you know, it's very -- lots of uncertainties, so difficult for us to project or otherwise we would have done it. Very strong for molecular and not yet back to normal. And we don't see back to normal on the other ranges that are negatively impacted."

I tried to figure out in -- when I look at BIOFIRE, how much of BIOFIRE sales is today dedicated to COVID versus the rest of the panels? This is my first question. Secondly, within the COVID testing, can we get a breakdown of revenue between the extraction and the testing, meaning between ARGENE testing and COVID-19or RP2.1 testing? And third question will deal with -- I just got the filing that Asia is a bit of a laggard. And effectively due to the immunoassay, we have normal backtracking to hospitalization there in the region? So, how do you explain this, the fact that there is no more strong rebound in Asia and how do you see more broadly speaking the sequential pick up in revenue in between April, May, June, July and even August? Just give us a flavor. Thank you."

As mentioned by Guillaume, Asia Pacific is less exposed to molecular than the rest of the regions. There is we don't see same uptake with FILMARRAY. It's not completely back to normal in Asia. China, we see slow ramp up, but I wouldn't say that life is going back to normal, at least in term of hospital traffic. And countries such as India are very -- are under very, very difficult situation. So I believe that the rest of Asia will come back also with return to normal. Asia is not only China for us. I mean there are many, many countries which are under difficult situation. Your question on the -- in BIOFIRE and the impact."

We wondered if we should sell it broader. But we have been able to add COVID to the RP panel with RP2 becoming RP2.1 including COVID really fast. BIOFIRE teams have done an excellent job there. And therefore, our approach, our strategy is really to push syndromic value and syndromic approach. So we actually sell in the U.S. and everywhere,RP2.1, the syndromic approach. We only continue to sell the single test for the DoD."

I think there is sort of a broader expectation that as we come into the winter months that life will get a bit more difficult for respiratory cases, those with combined flu or presenting with flu symptoms. Is it flu? Is it COVID? But I really wanted to point to your thoughts on the development in Australia, where there seems to be a very benign season indeed, with not many people presenting with respiratory symptoms. Is this a potential concern to you that -- in a sense or an observation that we might not see that strong pickup in cases into the back end of the year, thus limiting the demand for BIOFIRE and FILMARRAY consumables? So some thoughts on the Australian dynamic and read across would be helpful, please."

Australia, for me, it's difficult to know what it means, in fact, because I've seen the country I've been in lockdown also during part of this summer months, summer for us and winter for them. So when you're on the lockdown, I'm not sure this is where respiratory diseases are spread a lot. So I think it's difficult to see a correlation between what happens in Australia and what will happen in the upcoming winter. Whatever happens, I believe the syndromic approach is the right one to detect as you mentioned COVID [indiscernible] or the other difficult to make coloration at this stage."

And firstly, just sticking with the sales and marketing if I may, you mentioned that it was a usual double digit trend that was decreased for SG&A due to lockdowns. I guess looking beyond therefore 2020 and given your expands to expand ex-U.S. the BIOFIRE rollout, should we consider that double digit should be a trend that will likely continue for sales and marketing for a few years? Or I guess you need to perhaps balance that with also some of the factors you mentioned, such as the change in the U.S. pension and the phantom share plan, and perhaps give us some idea how we should be thinking about the sales and marketing trend beyond 2020 if possible?"

So again, our ambition remains the same to continue to expand the data and the customer base in the U.S. but even more internationally, outside of the U.S. which we required, of course the marketing expenses and trends in a significant way. Then as a way this becomes reality depend on the sanitary crises and when we can travel, reorganize events that potentially are not digital even."

As you have seen, so the microbiology for Q2 was at minus 14, immunoassay at minus 18, which obviously Q2 is the mostly impacted with both the Europe and now lockdown most of the period, U.S. under the lockdown or measures, Latin America, India and et cetera.",

So, even without giving figure, it's a bit better for June and July, but not faster recovery at all, probably because again hospital traffic has not fully recovered and lockdown measures in different countries reduced also maybe ID transmission.

Anyway, in broad terms, so BIOFIRE Defense is a specific fab with strong link with DoD that existed before we acquired BIOFIRE and remain so specific contracts with DoD. So in this case, actually the DoD ask for developments of the COVID test and funded it. As I said in Q1, we are able to actually develop it very fast, that said to this single COVID test that was sold to DoD and that\u2019s the main terms and the outlook for here increasing the capacity so it means that are interacted in the continuing to be supplied by BIOFIRE.

How would you qualify maybe region-by-region the gap between demand and supply currently for COVID test? And what's your view on the markets over capacity and under capacity given what we\u2019ve seen as fit on the market? That\u2019s one. Second question would be, related to your guidance. I'm wondering if the biggest reason why you haven't, preside your guidance related to price evolution, related to market share competition or specific potential decisions. That's the second question and the last question, maybe more general question regarding the current position now of bioMerieux. Now, would you consider that after this sedentary crisis, the global competitiveness of bioMerieux has increased, has stabilized or declined and why? Thank you."

The demand is there for molecular, but difficult to predict. The rest of this is more into that to make sure that we don\u2019t have the facility to follow the market as a market evolution.",
            "Your last question, I believe bioMerieux, but I would say maybe a diagnostic company will be stronger because I think this crisis has shown the value of diagnostics. It's all in a case of pandemic, but also in the role of thinking of patients. And I believe also that we have increased our positioning in molecular, which is a very promising technology in that space. So I would say that we should be -- we should be in reserved positions, but let's wait for the market dynamics and what comes after COVID. But for us, I think it's recognition of the value of diagnostic.",
            "And the first question to get demand, the gap demand, so I would say now, we need this -- we need every test. I think we are we'll distinguish those things even for, I believe, the most available in the market. There's a dairy free to go back to them a license to use a place to isolate and detect, but it takes time now to get some result sometimes. So it's good to have more tests."

And I wonder whether that's enabled some more momentum with approval in this important growth region? If you can comment on progress there, please, that would be appreciated.",
            "Second question, please. And again, I appreciate you're not giving a quantitative guidance, but if you could help me with the logic path? If one is seeing some recovery in your routine business, microbiology and immunoassay, industrial application and your expanding capacities for BIOFIRE pouches, could that indeed mean that we see accelerated growth to what we've seen in the first half -- in the second half of the year?

So, high inventory especially on RP to prepare for the flu season, and actually these were totally sold especially in March, April, when RP was used.",

I believe PCR today is a standard thing in the lab, so it will remain on this new antigen test using a different technology, with different performance but I think can be useful but if I understand for people without symptoms, with symptoms at this stage.

But from a qualitative continue, as we said, we believe that, potentially still a lot of growth outside of the U.S., clearly, we are not continuing to gain new customers in Europe in Latin America, a lot to grow for sure in Asia Pacific, by the way of Japan, that we entered more recently to the really good success. Australia as well, so until more recently, so it's clearly still a lot to gain. And in the U.S. probably as well even though it's more difficult to say because our penetration is off course much stronger. So, that's something to see when all this settles in the U.S."
