      "Darren Lampert": [
         "Thank you, Michael. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Before we begin our Q2 earnings call, I\u2019d like to begin by thanking our staff and customers for their hard work, dedication and loyalty during this time of uncertainty.",
         "As we continue to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak, GrowGen is considered an essential supplier to the agricultural industry, supplying the nutrients and nourishments required to feed their plants. Accordingly, all our 28 stores are opened during this difficult time and remain open. We have plans and procedures in place to ensure our customers and employees stay safe during this time of uncertainty. All of us at GrowGen remain committed to the safety and well-being of our customers and employees.",
         "On August 12, GrowGen entered into a partnership with Whole Cites Foundation, committing to donate product to develop urban farms across the United States. We\u2019re excited to report another quarter of record financial results and performance by our company.",
         "As I reflect on the quarter\u2019s results, I remind myself and our team that GrowGen is in the early stages of a multibillion-dollar industry, with tremendous growth ahead of us. GrowGen was built through hard work, limited capital and organic growth from 2014 to 2018.",
         "We built the foundation for growth in those early years. And in 2018, we raised $20 million that we invested in our business, driving sales from $30 million in 2018 to $80 million in 2019. On August 10, we surpassed the $100 million in sales, with over 18 weeks still to go in the year.",
         "The company\u2019s Q2 2020 record financial results reflect our continued focus on revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA expansion. Q2 2020 was the company\u2019s 10th consecutive record quarter of revenue. As we continue to outpace our guidance, we were increasing fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance to $170 million to $175 million and increasing adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2020 to $17 million to $18 million.",
         "We expect 2020 full-year GAAP pre-tax net income guidance to $7 million to $8 million. Revenue guidance for full-year 2021 is $245 million to $260 million and full-year adjusted EBITDA 2021 is $26 million to $28 million. Revenue was up 123% quarter-over-quarter to approximately $43.5 million versus $19.5 million for Q2 2019.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA was $4.6 million for Q2 2020, compared to $1.7 million for Q2 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 2020 was $0.12 per share basis. Net income from store operations was approximately $7.6 million, compared to $3.1 million for Q2 2019, an increase of 146%.",
         "Our same-store sales were 49% in Q2 2020 versus Q2 2019. Our online business, growgeneration.com, is projected to exceed $10 million in revenue in 2020, was up 149% for Q2 2020 versus Q2 2019 and up 163% for six months ended Q2 2020 versus six months ended Q2 2019. Our omni-channel strategy will connect all 28 of our store\u2019s inventories to our e-commerce site, allowing for buy online and pick up in-store functionality.",
         "GrowGen\u2019s just-in-time supply chain delivers our product safely and timely to our customers. Today, we offer will-call, curbside and direct-to-farm shipments from all our store locations and through our online e-commerce platform. We can ship to all 52 States.",
         "Recently, we have seen a surge in online revenues and we\u2019re well prepared to fulfill these orders. Our commercial division is projected to do in excess of $30 million in annual revenues for 2020 and added $9.3 million revenues in the quarter, 142% increase for Q2 2020 versus 2019.",
         "To highlight our market-by-market growth, Colorado was up 18% quarter-over-quarter, 21% for the six months; California 19%, plus 32% for the six months; Michigan 322%, plus 299% for the six months; and Oklahoma plus 348%, plus 332% for the six months. Our weekly walk-in transactions are now over 10,000, increased by 50% from Q1 2020 to the end of Q2 2020.",
         "On June 16, the company successfully acquired H2O Hydroponics and consolidated with our West Lansing operations into a new 15,000 square foot super hydroponic garden center. The company believes that the combined business will generate over $8 million in annual revenue in 2020.",
         "This week, we closed on our store Emerald City Gardens, our 28th store located in the heart of the green zone in Concord, California. Our commercial revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $17.7 million, an increase of 181% over the six months ended June 30, 2019. We have generated more commercial sales in the six months than we did in the entire 2019 year.",
         "We continue to see strong demand for our products that include LED lights, nutrients, additives, soils and other products that outfit and feed grower\u2019s gardens. Our newly launched private-label Sunleaves nutrients and additives line of product is now generating over $100,000 a month in sales.",
         "We are focused on margin expansion strategies that include furthering the deployment of more private-label products and driving more efficiencies at the purchasing level, as we continue to scale.",
         "We have new acquisitions and new store openings we plan to close during the remainder of 2020, as we continue to drive growth. Our mergers and acquisition pipeline is the most active it has been since our inception. We have set a corporate goal to reach 50 stores and 15 states in 2021.",
         "GrowGen has a tremendous team of essential employees who have made a commitment to our company and customers, and I couldn\u2019t be any prouder. I\u2019m inspired by their efforts and dedication that they have worked tirelessly to service our customers and communities.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Tony Sullivan, our Chief Operating Officer, who will brief everyone on our current COVID-19 risk mitigation procedures and key operation initiatives executed in Q2. And then to our CFO, Monty Lamirato, who\u2019ll provide more detail on our Q2 2020 year results. Tony?",
         "Thank you, Monty.",
         "In conclusion, GrowGen recorded its 10th consecutive record quarter of increased revenues and we achieved record adjusted earnings. GrowGen achieved the sales milestone, surpassing $100 million in sales on August 10. Our commercial team did more business in the first six months of 2020 than we did in the entire year 2019 and our e-commerce division is growing at over 140% in the same period quarter-over-quarter.",
         "Our store foot traffic is up 50% from end of Q1 2020 to the end of Q2 2020. Our company has tremendous growth momentum built into the remainder of the year. Our store acquisitions and new store openings continued to drive growth, while we delivered double-digit same-store sales results quarter-over-quarter.",
         "We set a goal to own and operate over 50 locations in 15 States during the year 2021. Today, we own and operate 28 locations. All stores will be connected to our e-commerce platform in September, providing our customers to buy online and pickup in-store option.",
         "GrowGen\u2019s preparedness delivered record results. And this execution discipline will continue to deliver positive results quarter-over-quarter.

         "We continue to cultivate the best and most knowledgeable staff in the country. We\u2019re focused on world-class customer service and commitment to our customers. We continue to invest in our supply chain and technology, creating more efficiencies across all departments.",
         "Execution of our financial goals and guidance is evidence with our Q2 2020 numbers we reported, with revenue up 123% quarter-over-quarter and adjusted EBITDA earnings $4.6 million, or $0.12 a share.",
         "Our second quarter 2020 was strong as we successfully added H2O Hydroponics to the portfolio. This week, we added our 28 store Emerald City Gardens located in Concord, California. We completed a $48 million institutional follow-on public offering led by Oppenheimer, which was oversubscribed three times.",
         "On June 29, GrowGen was added to the Russell 3000 Index. We believe our Russell 3000 listing will increase long-term shareholder value by improving awareness, liquidity and appeal to institutional investors.",
         "Our balance sheet is strong with approximately $60 million in cash, which allows us to continue to execute our internal growth initiatives, while we continue to purchase the best of breed hydroponic operations and open new GrowGen locations.",
         "We have increased fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance to $170 million to $175 million, adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2020 to $17 million to $18 million and full-year GAAP pre-tax net income guidance of $7 million to $8 million.",

      ],
      "Monty Lamirato": [
         "Thanks, Tony. Let\u2019s go over the Q2 2020 financial highlights. Some of these items were previously discussed by Darren, so some of them might be a little repetitive.",
         "Revenues up 123% to $43.5 million for Q2 2020 versus $19.5 million for Q2 2019. The revenue increase is the result of, one, an increase in same-store sales of 49% quarter-over-quarter. The addition of six new retail stores opened or acquired after June 30, 2019, that contributed no revenue in quarter two 2019, compared to $13.5 million in Q2 2020.",
         "Two stores opened in May 2019 that contributed $2.25 million in revenue this quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared to $1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, and a 142% increase in commercial business comparing Q2 2020 to Q2 2019 and a 149% increase in our online sales comparing Q2 2020 to Q2 2019.

         "Gross profit was $11.6 million for the second quarter Q2 2020, as compared to $5.8 million for Q2 2019, an increase of $5.8 million, or 99%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 26.7% for Q2 2020, compared to 29.9% for Q2 2019.",
         "The decrease in the gross profit margin percentage is due to, one, commercial and e-commerce revenues accounted for 27% of total revenues for Q2 2020, compared to 25% of total revenues for Q2 2019, resulting in a reduction of margin of approximately 0.8 basis points as a result of lower margins for the e-commerce and commercial sales.",
         "Two, in 2019 \u2013 in the first quarter of 2019, we acquired a significant amount of inventory from a vendor at a very substantial discount. Sales of this product in Q2 2019 accounted for 5% of overall revenues and we have very high margins, resulting in a 1.3 basis point increase in margin in 2019.",
         "Operating expenses as \u2013 are comprised of store operations, primarily payroll, rent, utilities, and corporate overhead. Operating costs were approximately $8.8 million for Q2 2020 versus approximately $4.6 million for Q2 2019, an increase of approximately $4.2 million, or 89%.",

Store operating costs are positively impacted by the opening of new and acquired stores throughout the second-half of 2019 and new stores in 2020, which have lower op \u2013 percentage of operating cost of revenue due to their larger size and higher revenue volume and a 49% increase in same-store sales.",
         "Corporate overhead, which is primarily comprised of share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative costs and corporate salaries and related expenses was approximately $4.8 million for Q2 2020, compared to approximately $1.9 million for Q2 2019.

         "The increase in non-cash share-based compensation was a result of several new executive employment agreements, which became effective January 1, 2020, for which share-based awards and option awards vested over a two-year period.",
         "The increase in salary expense from approximately $821,000 in Q2 2019 to approximately $2 million for Q2 2020 was primarily due to the increase in corporate staff to support expanding operations, including purchased store manager integration, accounting and finance, information systems, purchase and commercial sales staff.",

Net income from store operations, which was approximately $7.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared to $3.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, an increase of 146%.",
         "The increase from \u2013 income from store operations were offset by increased corporate overhead, which was approximately $4.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared to approximately $1.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $2.9 million, of which non-cash share-based compensation and depreciation and amortization was $1.1 million of that increase. Increase in G&A and salaries for the quarter ended June 30, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2019 accounted for the remaining increase.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA was $4.6 million for Q2 2020 versus $1.7 million for Q2 2019. The increase in adjusted EBITDA comparing Q2 2020 to Q2 2019 was due to: one, increase in net income of approximately $1.5 million; and two, non-cash add-backs, primarily depreciation amortization and share-based compensation, which were approximately $1.6 million for Q2 2020 versus $540,000 for Q2 2019.",

            "The question I have is, as you look at the results in the quarter recently from the sales, maybe in the expense part, could you help us understand better kind of the \u2013 sort of say, the puts and takes as it relates to COVID-19? I mean, are \u2013 to what extent are your sales \u2013 phenomenal sales growth could it be held back where you actually, to a certain extent, benefiting in the crisis in a similar type dynamic or expenses?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I\u2019ll take that, Brian. I think it\u2019s twofold. First is really difficult to ascertain. Our growth was continuing right up into COVID. So what you really saw during our fourth quarter and first quarter was really the increase in our same-store sales within our organization, as you saw probably, again, trending through last year.",
            "So the only thing that we\u2019ve really seen through COVID is the continued increase. What you\u2019re starting to see right now on, I think, is the resurgence of the cannabis markets in the United States. I mean, what you\u2019ve seen from certainly earnings calls from the big MSOs that business is booming. And you\u2019re starting to see, again, a lot of conversation going on in fed \u2013 with federal legalization and certainly, states following up, though. even back East.",
            "So I think you\u2019re just seeing a lot of positives throughout the market. But what we\u2019ve seen specifically during COVID is that we\u2019re outpacing our peers.

Within the context, you all lifted guidance for 2020, then introduced very compelling guidance for 2021. But how should we think about just the growth \u2013 the gross margins going forward, particularly in light of the continued outsized growth in commercial, private-label efforts and such?"

            "Brian, this is Darren. What you\u2019re also seeing, you\u2019re seeing a tremendous increase in foot traffic in our stores. You\u2019re seeing almost a 50% increase quarter-over-quarter. When you\u2019re looking at a blend of margins from GrowGeneration, it\u2019s threefold, it\u2019s commercial, it\u2019s e-commerce, and then it\u2019s foot traffic coming through the stores, which is also commercial, but not large MSO business.",
            "So what you\u2019re seeing in the \u2013 in our second quarter, about 27% of our sales was basically MSO and commercial business that\u2019s flowing through in the low-20s. And we see as GrowGen continues to grow more foot traffic coming through the stores. And certainly \u2013 and with more purchases out there, we\u2019re just seeing more customers are shopping.",
            "So you\u2019re seeing our margins right now pretty consistent where they are in the 26 to 27 point range. But we see when we start focusing on flowing through private-label products, which is certainly a work in progress, but some it\u2019s the biggest initiative at GrowGen right now. You\u2019ll see private-label products going through anywhere from 60 to 100 basis points.",
            "So you will see a kick up in margins slowly, but we are \u2013 we certainly are the belief that, our margins right now are certainly consistent throughout the year. But we think you will see these margins creeping up over the following years, as private-label becomes a bigger part of our business.",
            "I mean, right now, you\u2019re looking probably at 1% to 2% private-label initiatives. Hopefully, by the end of next year, we\u2019ll be again in the double-digit number. So you\u2019ll see it slowly, gradually increasing."

            "Sure. Thank you. Thank you, Glenn, for that question. It\u2019s a good question. We\u2019re constantly building our commercial book of business. And as we announced today, we had a significant increase in number of commercial accounts, up 167 for the quarter. We\u2019re now servicing over 700 commercial customers.",
            "We look at commercial business as a segment of the business, where a commercial customer is defined for us as someone that\u2019s spending over $50,000 or more with the company. We have a dedicated sales force. We have a dedicated customer service division that works directly.",
            "And we think we\u2019ve perfected the way the interface efficiently with these large multi-state operators and large regional commercial customers. And the evidence is based on the success that we\u2019ve had. I mean, quarter-over-quarter, we were up in our commercial division 142%, six months 181% and we\u2019re leveraging.",
            "And I think what\u2019s really working really well for the company is that, we have this interconnectivity between our commercial sales team that is selling in, based on a product selection that is personalized to that particular growth. GrowGen has the capability to really supply exactly what that grower wants.",
            "I think one of the things that we really understood very early on, that every commercial grower \u2013 every commercial cultivator grows a little bit differently and you have to provide the ability to deliver what they are actually looking to use that they\u2019re used to use from a nutrient perspective, a lighting perspective and GrowGen supply chain and inventory system is able to manage that. And that\u2019s what\u2019s closing business.",
            "And then you tie that together with a just-in-time inventory system with the supply chain that we\u2019ve created through the 28 locations. We\u2019re able to reach commercial customers same day and just-in-time. We have their inventory stocked at any one of our 28 locations, which is certainly expanding as we look at new markets coming on.",
            "So GrowGen is in a very strategic and unique position to not only acquire customers, but to service and manage those customers on an ongoing basis with a local presence, combined with our commercial division, which is made up of \u2013 right now, we have about 20 individuals and that division has grown significantly. As Darren mentioned in his comments, our commercial division in the first six months in more business than we did in the entire year for 2019.",
            "So it\u2019s a constant lead generation to quoting to closing and then leveraging the supply chain to service those customers on an ongoing basis. And then personalizing the offerings and our ability to deliver exactly what they want. That\u2019s what\u2019s acquiring these commercial customers and retaining those commercial customers."

Certainly, the larger acquisitions may go to four to five, but it\u2019s been pretty consistent throughout the years that we\u2019ve been in business.",
            "And as we\u2019ve stated earlier during our conference call, our acquisition pipeline is big and getting bigger. One of the interesting parts about that, because there\u2019s a lot of work for GrowGen still to do on the existing states there we\u2019re in. We\u2019re seeing tremendous growth in the California markets right now.",
            "GrowGen still does not have a large presence in Southern California. We see more work to do in the Michigan markets right now. We see some work to do in the main markets in the Washington markets. So the interesting part is besides, again, GrowGen is forecasting 15 states next year and probably in excess of 15 States, but you still will see work at a GrowGen in existing States that we\u2019re in."

What we\u2019ve done over the years is look at acquisitions in mature markets and the new emerging markets, which are \u2013 we were very excited about what we think is going to happen during this election year with Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Arizona. Those are markets where there\u2019s really nothing for us to acquire. And those are markets that GrowGen will open up a new location, a super hydroponic operation to really take advantage of legalization.",
            "So, we\u2019re very much \u2013 and as Tony mentioned, we have a two-year real estate initiative to look at locations, where these licenses are being granted. Combining that with, as Darren mentioned, a very aggressive acquisition program in the more mature markets, Michigan and California.",
            "So you\u2019re combining both the acquisition strategy combined with the new markets that are opening up. And our ability to open up a new location in 90 days really gives the company tremendous first market mover position to take advantage of legalization as it occurs.",
            "So it\u2019s really \u2013 those strategies that we really implemented, you can see it in the results in Oklahoma. We were the first company to really take advantage of legalization, opened up four locations, each one of those locations are approaching $1 million a month of business.",
            "So, we have the staff, the infrastructure, and the expertise. They\u2019re not only acquired, but to certainly open up new locations as these markets legalized themselves. And we think there\u2019s going to be a number of these new states coming on Board in the fall."

There\u2019s tremendous opportunity. We\u2019ve seen it with Sunleaves, which is approaching a $1 million brand.",
            "We brought in some products under the Pioneer brand. There\u2019s just tremendous opportunity we see. Now that we build out the distribution. We have the supply chain to take advantage of the trademarks, developing new products, margin expansion, we will not bring a private-label product into the market unless we can pick up over 50% margins.",
            "And we\u2019ve set a very aggressive goal internally to get to 10%, next year, 20%; the following year, 30%. And we think the grower customer is certainly looking at costs. There\u2019s return on investment.",
            "And we think, through a cost-efficient and a high-quality private-label offering, with the expertise of our grow pros that operate within our store footprint, our commercial grow technicians, we can really develop a very profitable and broad-based private-label offering. And we just think there\u2019s tremendous upside in terms of margin expansion and just providing another alternative to our customer.",
            "But we have to also be cognizant that there are brands and there are existing products that the growers are gravitating to \u2013 so we stock those products. GrowGeneration has built the largest selection of hydroponic products in the country. So, we\u2019ve taken somewhat of an agnostic approach and a personalization approach.",
            "We drive our business based on what does the grower need? What products are they buying? And our ability to offer a complete solution is, why we\u2019re able to acquire new commercial customers? Why are we getting more walk-in traffic coming into the store? Because we have the selection.",
            "You\u2019re seeing more larger square footage, more selection, and then you combine that with our knowledge-based sales team, who understand the agricultural side of the plant. That\u2019s what\u2019s resonating. And that\u2019s why this company continues to put up triple-digit growth and double-digit same-store sales growth.",
            "In regards to your hemp question, we certainly have our eye on the hemp market. I think, as everyone probably realizes, the hemp market has been really a slow to take market. Our opinion is until the FDA really puts out a very specific position on the efficacy of it, the safety of it, the market is still going to be relatively niche.",
            "We certainly have hemp customers that we work with. We have a product offering. We certainly have product in the nutrient area that\u2019s specific for hemp farmers, but that market is still a very small part of the overall revenue pie of the company. But do we believe that, that market can take off? Absolutely.",
            "With COVID, we\u2019re seeing a resurgence of individuals that are now embracing home gardening. We think there\u2019s a tremendous upside in terms of the home market, where home \u2013 consumers are going to start to create their own gardens, their own edible gardens for food and produce and those kind of things.",
            "So GrowGen is well-positioned to market and attract those kinds of customers as well. So there\u2019s so many opportunities in terms of different vertical markets that the company can enter into in addition to the cannabis market that will drive growth in the future for this company.",
            "And we\u2019re certainly looking at how to attack it, how to acquire those customers, how to create the right suite of products, and curate the right suite of products for all of those different vertical markets, that are all part of this agricultural resurgence that\u2019s coming into our society, that\u2019s driven by many different influences and GrowGen is well-positioned to attack all those verticals. So, that\u2019s our position. Hopefully, I answered your question."

And if we look at your guidance, which is embedding 35% better profits this year, 25% better sales growth and that continuing into 2021, what is it that gives you comfort, maybe kind of on a metric and a couple of things that I\u2019m trying to think about is your customer value.",

            "And then my follow-up question is really just on your 2021 guidance, does that include non-organic growth? Or is it only organic growth like you have guided before? Thank you."

            "I\u2019ll start off and probably kick it off. 2021, our growth includes acquisitions and new store opening. So that\u2019s, again, it\u2019s early guidance. So again, right now, it\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing within our portfolio in connection with, again, acquisitions, new store openings, their projections and certainly very early on in the game. And just so, you do know, we had soft guidance out the Wall Street for $180 million for 2021.",
            "So, like anything else, we had to give \u2013 we had to change that number, and this is what we feel comfortable with right now. We certainly hope that number will go higher throughout the year. We\u2019re extremely comfortable with that number as we spend.",
            "What we\u2019re seeing in the industry right now is, you\u2019re seeing the resurgence of the cannabis industry in the United States. Are you seeing an industry that went through certainly bumps and grinds took time to really get going? And what you\u2019re seeing right now is, I spoke earlier about, as you look at the reports coming out from some of the large MSOs around the country, cannabis sales are up and they\u2019re up tremendously and they\u2019re continuing.",
            "So you\u2019re seeing an industry where you\u2019re starting to grow up. As the industry grows up, there\u2019s always a leader on the side supplying that industry, and that\u2019s GrowGeneration. We\u2019re seeing our stores. We\u2019re looking at in our acquisition pipeline, their sales are up to certainly not anywhere near the percentages that our sales are up.",
            "What you\u2019re seeing right now from GrowGeneration is, you\u2019re seeing foot traffic increasing, you\u2019re seeing commercial sales increasing, you\u2019re seeing online sales increasing, so you\u2019re seeing it throughout. You\u2019re not just seeing one small area of growth, you\u2019re seeing the growth throughout the whole company.",
            "And what you\u2019re is GrowGen building bigger stores, suppliers up, our service is getting better. And you\u2019re seeing really a company that\u2019s been built. And then in the last couple of years, GrowGen, from 2014 to 2018, it was a $30 million company. So you\u2019re seeing guidance going from $30 million, up to $1.25 billion in three years. And you\u2019re seeing it really through, I think, the experience of learning of a new industry. And again, GrowGen has taken advantage.",
            "We have a tremendous staff has been with us, source staff. Again, we have employees that have been with us from the start. And certainly, new stores that we purchase, owners have stayed on with GrowGen. So we have tremendous experience in the industry. And again, I think it\u2019s just all starting to payoff, as we speak. And anything else, business just continues. We don\u2019t see it stopping.",
            "We see a lot of verticals, one is private-label products, one certainly is the home garden markets for GrowGen. And you\u2019ll see these things and you\u2019re seeing pegboards right now. Tony is working on for every store. You\u2019re seeing all our stores within the signage, the same. All GrowGen stores look the same, and you\u2019re going to have a happy experience shopping at GrowGen for your gardening needs.",
            "And just to add to what Darren just said, Peter, and I think, it\u2019s really, really important to focus in on the multi-channel sales platform. GrowGeneration has stores, garden centers, where we\u2019re getting tremendous traffic coming in. And that\u2019s only going to increase with new store openings, acquisitions.",
            "You have a growing commercial division, that\u2019s continuing to grow through a dedicated sales team that\u2019s calling on the multi-state operators and the local and regional commercial customers. And then you have e-commerce, which is a project that we\u2019ve been working on for over a year to bring the optionality of ordering online and picking up at any one of our stores or ordering online and drop shipping direct to the home or the the farm.",
            "So when you look at GrowGen\u2019s mix of sales, it\u2019s multi-channel and we run our company that way. We\u2019re constantly driving marketing and sales efforts and lead generation across those three platforms. And we think it\u2019s very unique and very special to what we have. It\u2019s that multi-channel approach that allows us to continue to grow across those multiple platforms. And I think that\u2019s really an important point to understand how this company continues to grow at a top line triple-digit and continue to drive double-digit same-store sales.",
            "And with the omni-channel approach, which is just at the infancy of where we are relaunching it in September, the ability to give our customers optionality, on-demand ordering, business tools, which allows the commercial customers to truly understand their purchasing behavior, invoicing, tying them to our inventory, store location, giving them the ability to pick up at any one of our locations, all of that is going to continue, in our opinion, drive the results that we have experienced in this quarter and going forward. So multi-channel sales is a very important component to how we operate the business, how we continue to drive our business."

One thing I\u2019m curious about in terms of as you kind of target your customer base in the early days, can you give some color in terms of whether or not this could be more so on the commercial side or the in-store, because, like I said, with COVID, it seems like it\u2019s impacted the supply chain, but also wondering in terms of like consumer education in terms of your own product offerings beyond just the cost, but also the quality?",
            "And then also whether or not you believe there\u2019s going to be more opportunity, potentially in the new stores in States that you have to enter to kind of bring in those private-label brands initially those customers versus kind of your legacy stores where you have to transition them from the current products they\u2019re using?

      "64": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So first of all, as you look at existing stores versus new stores, we\u2019re doing one thing that, that I kind of mentioned earlier and that is we are going to rebrand, reset, every single store, so that customer experience whether you shop in a store in Rhode Island or California is the same.",
            "We\u2019re in the middle of that right now. And that will be a very similar experience. Cash wrap, paid walls, positioning of our brand offerings and our private-label offerings. And it\u2019s going to allow us to really enhance that customer experience when they walk into the store.",
            "So item one is, in the next six months, we will have a very similar experience in all stores. In new markets, it doesn\u2019t allow us to build a little bigger store, a little better opportunity with our newest design right out the gate versus refreshing that design going forward.",
            "So we\u2019re excited about new market growth. But we\u2019re equally excited about refreshing, rebranding our existing growth, because we know that\u2019s going to send the value proposition we\u2019re after for customers no matter where they shop. So, hopefully, that answers that."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Tony Sullivan"
      },
      "65": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Hey, Aaron, I\u2019ll just add to what Tony said. What\u2019s exciting about the business model, when we look at these acquisitions, our purchasing power is increasing margin 5% to 6%, 7%. So there\u2019s such accretion that comes just from the actual fact that we\u2019re now taking over their business.",
            "Combining that with putting the right inventory mix, as Tony mentioned, putting the right SKU rationalization, the right planogram, putting the first 25 feet and really putting a GrowGeneration brand on that store has tremendous impact in terms of walk-in traffic and margin expansion. And most of these individual stores, even regional stores are not getting anywhere near the kind of margins that we\u2019re getting based on the fact that we\u2019ve created a national scaled hydroponic business.",
            "So there\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s margin expansion. There\u2019s SKU rationalization, putting private-label in, expands the margin, putting our brand, putting our commercial team against those stores, adding more commercial business, all of it translates to increased sales, better margins, more profitability and consolidation of these markets that we\u2019re entering into.",
            "And we see that across the Board, California, Michigan, Oregon, all the new markets that we just purchased, you look at the same-store sales, if you look at the market over market percentage growth, that\u2019s because we\u2019re increasing the inventory levels. We\u2019re putting products that the growers really are looking to buy at margins that are increasing because of our purchasing power, plus adding the marketing and the sales is driving more revenue. So it\u2019s the combination of all those activities that\u2019s driving, both top line and bottom line results for this company."

You gave some color earlier on gross margin, as well as the SG&A with ERP system. So as we look at the guidance for 2021, it looks like it implies just above 50 basis points of margin expansion.",
            "Darren, I know you said you\u2019re very confident kind of in that guidance there. So just as we look at the bottom line and the implied margins, just want to think about the puts and takes there as we think about, is it just that you\u2019re a little bit more conservative? Is it more like margin opportunity, but you just don\u2019t know where those acquisitions are going to fall and they might kind of bring down the margin near-term as you benefit from the scale you provide and implementing them into your own ERP system?",
            "And then on the gross margin side, is it just the puts and takes there in terms of private-label being able to offside some potential negative mix and channel mix coming from commercial sales. So just any kind of overall color on what you expect in terms of that margin guidance provided for 2021, compared to 2020? Thanks."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. As you know, Aaron, and again, we certainly spoke about this, GrowGen has always been conservative with guidance. It\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s very challenging to force \u2013 the forecast guidance is such a fast-moving industry. And again, we keep outpacing guidance and we try our best to give guidance that we think is accurate. Again, business is growing much quicker than we think.",
            "With regards to margins, you probably see from our EBITDA numbers next year, next year is a long ways away. So right now, this is our best guess going into next year before we really get private-label up and running. Before we close \u2013 get these acquisitions closed and just get a better look into it.",
            "Again, we purchase \u2013 we purchased \u2013 we have limited purchasing larger stores and opening certainly want some color, a couple of months out to give us some indication really margins in new stores under GrowGeneration tutelage.",
            "So right now, it would be really difficult for us to start upping margin accretion next year without really seeing where next year is. So certainly, you\u2019ll see us without a question after the first quarter of next year, certainly, refining guidance and again, if we\u2019re seeing higher margins flowing through, higher EBITDA numbers flowing through, there you\u2019ll see that \u2013 you\u2019ll see certainly that an updated guidance in the first quarter of next year.",
            "But we\u2019re still in August. We still do not know where COVID is going on. It\u2019s just \u2013 we keep seeing sales increasing day-over-day. And again, one of the other interesting parts if you take a look even if you back out our $100 million number that we\u2019ve kind of guidance the loss we were first 40 days were in the third quarter, and they were strong.",
            "So, we\u2019re seeing continued strength into August right now, July was a wonderful month for GrowGen. So we\u2019re not seeing business slowing. And it\u2019s over again, as you probably see, again, we purchased three stores this year. And again, way under our target for this time, you will see a very aggressive next four months for GrowGen on the acquisition trail.",
            "So you will \u2013 hopefully, again, as we get these acquisitions completed and done and we understand the margins coming out of these stores. And really what we can do, you certainly you\u2019ll see guidance updates from GrowGen."

That\u2019s really where you\u2019re seeing pockets, you\u2019re seeing also in Colorado, very small in Washington. But absent that you\u2019re seeing single stores, some \u2013 probably if you would ask me and this is extremely rough guess. It\u2019s probably 20 stores doing over $10 million in business throughout the country right now.",

What you\u2019re seeing is, we keep speaking about is when you go into the New Jersey markets and the Pennsylvania markets and these smaller markets that are just emerging, you\u2019re seeing stores that are small 2,000 square foot stores, GrowGen is selling into the states.",
            "One thing from looking at our numbers, you\u2019ll see certainly the crazy numbers coming out of Rhode Island store, same-store sales. And the growth in Rhode Island has been spectacular. And people always ask the question, what\u2019s going on in Rhode Island? Our Rhode Island store is located in a wonderful place in Warwick right off of 95, and we\u2019re shipping into the Massachusetts market from our Warwick store.",
            "So, we have a lot of business in Mass right now on post opening a store, we\u2019re using our Rhode Isla store basically for Massachusetts, licensing and Mass is very spread out. So certainly, one thing that we see is, we need to know where licensing is before GrowGen puts a store.",
            "We need ZIP codes, we need growers, and we really need to get a great understanding of where these stores belong. So right now, again, we know every single store in the country. We\u2019ve spoken to every store in the country.

Once of time of each employee that\u2019s working at the store, concentration of sales. And also we look at, again, bigger purchases for GrowGen require two-year audits.",

And that\u2019s really not urge of it. It\u2019s certainly nothing that no one else looks at. It\u2019s \u2013 again, it\u2019s sales, it\u2019s margins, it\u2019s inventory levels of employees. It\u2019s an earlier shift for GrowGen. Again, where the employees fit into the GrowGen family.",

And we\u2019re going through that right now in the Los Angeles market.",
            "Again, there\u2019s some large stores out in LA. Does it makes sense for GrowGen to pick up an existing large store? Or does it make more sense to GrowGen could build an existing store the way we want it built? So there\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s a lot that goes into these acquisitions for acquisitions, certainly a much quicker on the Emerald Garden acquisition. We found this still, we bought it within a month.",
            "So certainly, we have a team that goes out, that assesses it, counts inventory, again, simple contracts, and they\u2019re all APAs or Asset Purchase Agreements, don\u2019t take any liability through these purchases. And we close them. And again, we\u2019ve done a good job of it and certainly, we\u2019ll see a tremendous amount of acquisitions over the next year."
