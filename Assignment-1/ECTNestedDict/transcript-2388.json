      "Brian Nicholson": [
         "Thank you, Bruce. In the second quarter, comparable system-wide RevPAR declined to 28.7% due to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period in 2019 driven by an 18.3% decline in ADR as well as an approximately 1,010 basis point decline in occupancy. The drop in RevPAR was most pronounced in April, where we saw declines of approximately 35% year-over-year. While June saw RevPAR declines of approximately 24%. The decline in RevPAR was primarily driven by a 50% decline in transient business compared to a 16% decline in business from our core Extended Stay guests. Revenue for guests staying a month or longer declined less than 10% during the quarter.",
         "For the first half of 2020, comparable system-wide RevPAR declined 18.1%. Revenue from third-party channels declined 55% during the second quarter, predominantly from OTAs. ESA\u2019s channels saw revenue declines of less than 20% driven by a 13% decline in revenue from our call center. This pattern also held true even with our 0 to 6 night guests. We saw revenue from third-party channels decline approximately 60%, while revenue from transient guests through ESA\u2019s channels declined approximately 35%. The company\u2019s RevPAR index increased 49% year-over-year to 140.6% in the second quarter, with relative gains in both occupancy and rate.",
         "Hotel operating margin declined 1,270 basis points in the second quarter to 41.7%. The decrease in hotel operating margin was driven by decreased company-owned hotel RevPAR. Partially offsetting the decline in RevPAR was a 10% decline in comparable hotel operating expenses in the second quarter. The decline in operating expenses was driven by a decrease in OTA commissions, a decrease in digital marketing expense, a reduction in labor cost and a reduction in credit card fees partially offset by increased expense for personal protective equipment for our associates, an increase in property taxes and insurance, and a $1 million increase in allowance for guest non-payment.",
         "Hotel operating margin rose from 35.2% in April to 45.4% in June. Hotel operating margin for the first half of 2020 declined 860 basis points to 43.8%. Corporate overhead expense, excluding share-based compensation and transaction costs, fell from $22.8 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $21.1 million in the second quarter of 2020 as we paired back expenses from our 2020 budget, but was up slightly from the second quarter of 2019 due primarily to increased short-term incentive compensation expense.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $74.4 million compared to $153.6 million in the same period in 2019. The decline in adjusted EBITDA was driven by the decline in RevPAR partially offset by a decrease in property level expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was $15.5 million in April, $26.9 million in May, and $31.9 million in June. Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2020 was $172.1 million compared to $270 million in the first half of 2019.",
         "Net interest expense during the quarter, increased by $3.8 million to $33.6 million, due to increased debt outstanding, partially offset by a lower LIBOR rate. The company had an income tax benefit of approximately $6.1 million in the second quarter compared to an $11.2 million income tax expense in the same period in 2019. Adjusted FFO per diluted paired share declined 67.9% in the second quarter to $0.17 per share compared to $0.53 in the same period in 2019. The decline in adjusted FFO per diluted paired share was driven by a decline in comparable system-wide RevPAR and an increase in net interest expense partially offset by an income tax benefit and a reduction in paired shares outstanding. Adjusted FFO per diluted paired share for the first half of 2020 was $0.48 compared to $0.89 in the first half of 2019.",
         "The company had a net loss of $8.8 million during the quarter compared to net income of $59.7 million in the same period in 2019. The decrease in net income was driven by a decline in comparable system-wide RevPAR, an increase in depreciation expense and net interest expense partially offset by a decrease in hotel operating expenses and an income tax benefit. The overwhelming majority of the net loss in the quarter occurred in April as the company recorded net income of approximately $2 million in June. The company had a net loss of $0.9 million for the first half of 2020 compared to net income of $88.1 million in the first half of 2019.",
         "Adjusted paired share loss per diluted paired share in the quarter was $0.04 compared to income of $0.32 in the same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decline in RevPAR as well as increased depreciation and net interest expense partially offset by an income tax benefit and a reduction in paired shares outstanding. Adjusted paired share income per diluted paired share for the first half of 2020 was $0.03 compared to $0.48 in the first half of 2019.",
         "The company ended the second quarter with $682 million in cash and restricted cash and total debt outstanding of approximately $3.08 billion. Due to the company\u2019s significantly improved operating position since April and with the company currently generating positive cash flow at RevPAR levels in June, July, and so far in August, we repaid the $350 million REIT revolver last week with cash on hand, reducing our gross debt outstanding to $2.7 billion. We feel our balance sheet is strong, with ample cash and liquidity and no significant maturities until May 2025 and covenant-light debt.",
         "We are pleased that we are once again generating positive free cash flow. As Bruce mentioned earlier, at Q3 RevPAR levels to-date, the company generates pro forma between $5 million and $10 million in net positive cash flow per month, even including our significant investment into on-balance sheet hotels, which we expect to wrap up in the first half of 2021. Our focus on uses for free cash flow in the near and medium-term will be to maintain sufficient liquidity to de-lever our balance sheet, to invest in our core business, and prudently to return capital to shareholders.",
         "Capital expenditures in the second quarter totaled $50.7 million, including $1.8 million for renovation capital and $21.8 million for hotel development. The company opened 3 new purpose-built ESA hotels during the quarter, while our franchisee opened 1 new purpose-built ESA hotel. As a reminder, after we complete the on-balance sheet hotel development process in the first half of 2021, we expect to grow unit count predominantly, if not exclusively, through franchise growth rather than through on-balance sheet development. Our total pipeline stood at 69 hotels at the end of the second quarter. We do not expect the pipeline to begin to increase meaningfully again until the financing market improves and general RevPAR levels begin to increase. But we remain very active in discussions with current and potential franchisees both for conversions in the near to medium-term and new build in the medium to long-term.",
         "Yesterday, the Board of the ESH Hospitality Incorporated declared a cash dividend of $0.01 per paired share payable on September 8, 2020 to shareholders of record as of August 25, 2020. The management team and the boards of ESA and ESH Hospitality continued to review the company\u2019s distribution levels. ESH Hospitality will continue to meet its REIT requirements, including distribution to shareholders of at least 90% of its pre-tax income. The company did not repurchase any paired shares during the second quarter and our current total outstanding remaining authorization for paired share repurchase remains $101.1 million. The company does not currently expect to resume share repurchases this year.",
         "For the third quarter, the company expects comparable system-wide RevPAR declines between 18% and 21% and adjusted EBITDA between $98 million and $105 million. RevPAR in July declined approximately 20% partially helped by the July 4 holiday shift and is down approximately 18% month-to-date in August. Comparable system-wide occupancy in recent weeks has been around 80%, hitting 81.5% last week. Adjusted EBITDA in July was approximately $38 million.",
         "Due to the uncertain nature of the pace of the economic recovery, the results of the upcoming election, the potential for future shutdowns are going backward in reopening phases as well as the unknown timeline for a vaccine, we will not provide guidance for the full year 2020 for most operating metrics. However, we do continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be between $160 million and $190 million, while we lower our net interest expense estimate to $133 million due to lower LIBOR rates and the revolver pay-down at ESH Hospitality. We modestly increased our depreciation expense expectation for the year to $198 million to $203 million.",
         "Operator, let\u2019s now go to questions."
      ],
      "Bruce Haase": [
         "Thanks, Rob and good morning, everyone. To start off, I would like to say thanks to our nearly 8,000 employees for all their hard work and tireless efforts over the past few months. Not only did our dedicated associates keep 100% of our properties in continuous operations during the most difficult period in the history of the lodging industry, but thanks to their efforts, we also made strong strides in building our business for the post-pandemic long-term.",
         "While I am very pleased with our financial and operating performance during the quarter, I am most proud of how we achieved those results. Our company has come together as a team like never before. We have leaned hard into our corporate values, putting people first, doing what\u2019s right and caring for our community. The acts of kindness, compassion and understanding that our associates have demonstrated everyday to their teammates and our guests during this difficult period represent the behaviors that make those values real. And I firmly believe that Extended Stay America\u2019s culture has had a huge impact on the financial results we are pleased to report today.",
         "While the COVID-19 pandemic has severely tested our business and our people, it\u2019s also strengthened our company. Not only did we keep every hotel in the system open for business, we have grown occupancy across the system each week since April. We are now generating positive cash flow. We avoided significant furloughs in our hourly ranks and we are actively hiring across our portfolio. We have continued to invest in our people and our business. We have added strong talent with deep industry experience in the Extended Stay segment across the organization and those investments are already making a noticeable difference. Our ability to avoid management furloughs at headquarters and across the country is unparalleled in the industry today and a significant competitive advantage as we are able to maintain continuity throughout this crisis. Our entire company is highly motivated. And for the management team, that means we are squarely focused on improving the business and planning for the future.",
         "Our second quarter results clearly demonstrate that Extended Stay America and our business model is far different from the transient lodging brands. During the second quarter, our comparable system-wide RevPAR declined by 28.7% and that compares to industry declines of 70% and declines of roughly 50% for other mid-priced Extended Stay hotel rooms. In fact, we beat every benchmark in the industry by a large amount in the second quarter. Our performance exceeded the overall industry, competitive mid-priced Extended Stay hotels, our competitive set as well as the economy and mid-scale change scales.",
         "Our RevPAR index increased by over 4,600 basis points to 141 in the second quarter, but we are much more than an outperformer during a long and lingering pandemic. Our singular focus on the Extended Stay segment is not only a strategic advantage during difficult industry cycles, but I believe it also be a source of value creation as we return to more normal times. One reason is that our company and our business model is incredibly flexible and adaptable. Our teams are nimble and quick to react to changing market conditions. Last spring, we saw many important demand drivers such as transient leisure essentially disappeared during the quarter. Our teams pivoted quickly to find new sources of Extended Stay demand from segments such as warehousing and logistics, temporary medical and construction. And difficult economic times often create transitions in people\u2019s lives and those transition also increases the demand for our products. Early on, we aligned our field operations, sales and revenue management teams around the single goal, find new sources of Extended Stay demand and bring those customers to our hotels.",
         "As the environment changes, we can and we will adjust our sources of Extended Stay business, a segment which remains underserved. In doing so, we can outperform during the difficult times and fully participate in the better times, all with limited volatility for our shareholders. These are some of the themes we intend to explore more fully in the Analyst Day presentation being planned for later this year. In addition to our national and field base Extended Stay sales force, we are now seeing the positive impact of our initial improvements to our proprietary distribution channels, our website and our call center.",
         "As the only lodging distribution system solely focused on the Extended Stay segment, ESA\u2019s proprietary channels are a very valuable asset. During the second quarter, revenue from ESA\u2019s proprietary channels, which generates most of our Extended Stay business, were down only 18% compared to a 55% decline for revenue delivered from third-party OTA and opaque channels. We believe that our product also represents a competitive advantage. 100% of our guest rooms have full kitchens giving our guests an unprecedented level of control over their travel experience. A critical customer preference that is likely to be even more appreciated than it was before.",
         "To highlight our product advances and the leading health and safety practices, we launched our STAY Confident program in May. STAY Confident provides a uniform platform to communicate all the actions we are taking to keep our guests safe, healthy, and in control of their travel experience. We believe our value proposition for growing number of guests is stronger than ever and that value proposition in combination with our drivable suburban locations, accessible price points and our ability to adapt to changing market condition positions us to continue to outperform.",
         "I would like now to turn some of the more recent trends that we have seen in our business during the month of July. Today, our company occupancy levels are the envy of the industry. Our system-wide occupancy has increased every week since mid-April. From a low point in the high 50% range in April, we are now operating at an 81% occupancy level in August. This is above both our 2019 full year average and consistent with pre-pandemic levels at this time last year. We believe our occupancy is currently the highest of any publicly reporting brand in the U.S. today, including significantly more residential economy Extended Stay hotel brands. And our results are widespread.",
         "In the second quarter, a handful of markets achieved either positive RevPAR performance or declined less than 5%. And these statistics have continued to improve in August, with 17 of our top 50 markets, currently showing either positive RevPAR comparisons or down just 5% or less. Average daily rate has improved as well from $53 ADR in late April to $59 last week. We now have more hotels operating above 90% occupancy than below 70%. This has enabled our revenue management teams to adjust pricing in many hotels, including pulling back on some deeply discounted promotional rates for stays of 60 nights or longer that we introduced early on in the pandemic. The sense of urgency and alignment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the implementation of many strategic initiatives.",
         "Most prominently, we are focused on improving our core operations on driving Extended Stay demand. I am particularly proud of the rapid progress we have made driving more guests to our proprietary distribution channels. While we have seen some decrease in business delivered from our national accounts due to COVID-19, our field sales teams are delivering business at levels that are consistent with this time last year. And I believe that\u2019s a major accomplishment in this environment. We are also seeing encouraging results from our initial improvements in our call center and our website esa.com. Revenue from these proprietary channels has been down only roughly 10% in recent weeks and on some days we have even seen year-over-year book revenue growth at esa.com and our call center.",
         "The mix of revenue from Extended Stay guests during the second quarter increased to 72% compared to 61%, in the same period of 2019, nearly already achieving our long-term goal of 75% to 80% of our revenue coming from our core Extended Stay guests. Throughout the company, we continue to invest in our people and upgrade talent where necessary. Our commercial engine has benefited from many new leadership positions, including a new VP of marketing and e-commerce, a new creative director, and a new sales leader. We continue to top grade our property management organization, including two new regional Vice Presidents and multiple high-quality district managers. We also are building our franchise capabilities with new leaders in franchise development and services. All of these folks are long-time industry leaders with extensive experience in the Extended Stay segment. These capabilities will facilitate our shift to an asset like growth strategy already underway.",
         "I said this before and I believe it firmly now more than ever, Extended Stay America has the most compelling value proposition in the industry for both developers that want to build new Extended Stay hotels and for owners of existing Extended Stay hotels that may wish to convert. The awareness of the ESA brand and our singular focus on the Extended Stay segment in everything we do, coupled with our proven prototype and industry leading performance through the pandemic positions us very well to be the leading Extended Stay franchise lord in the industry. We believe that ESA offers a superior value proposition compared to our competitors that offer transient oriented revenue systems.",
         "Today, for example, our four largest franchisees have seen phenomenal performance through the pandemic with some even seeing year-to-date revenue on par with 2019. Our first new construction franchised hotel that opened in May is already running a RevPAR level of over $50 in recent weeks. With the strength of our model throughout this crisis, and a strong support system, we have significant interest from franchisees, especially around conversion opportunities in the near-term and new construction as the credit market sees in the future. Despite the challenges from COVID-19 and the chill in the market for asset sales, our portfolio remains a source of long-term shareholder value, strategic curating the portfolio to identify properties with a higher and better use that can trade at accretive multiples remains the core tenant of our long-term strategy. The current environment may have slowed our ability to execute this strategy, but we remain confident that this will be an area of shareholder value creation in the years to come.",
         "Before I turn the call over to Brian for more details, I would like to touch on our liquidity position. In the last 3 months, we have moved from a pro forma cash burn of approximately $15 million per month after interest in CapEx in April to a pro forma cash increase of $5 million to $10 million per month in the month of July. These results include significant investments in on-balance sheet new build development that begin to taper off soon as we wind down our on-balance sheet development program. Due to our increased confidence and our ability to generate cash in this challenging environment, last week, we repaid our $350 million revolver at our REIT subsidiary from cash on hand. As our cash flow continues to grow, we expect to de-lever the balance sheet, continue to invest in our core business, and judiciously return capital to shareholders.",
         "Despite the challenges in the lodging environment, I am convinced now more than ever that given our unique business model, the talents of our team and the strength of our corporate culture, there are significant growth and value creations for ESA in the coming years. I am confident that we can continue to outperform during these difficult times and fully participate in the better times when they arrive executing our growth plans and create significant shareholder value in the process. The best days for this company are ahead of us, which of course includes growing adjusted EBITDA to 2019 levels and beyond in the years to come.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our second quarter financial results further, provide more details on our balance sheet, and leverage and discuss some guidance for third quarter and 2020. Brian?"

The accompanying presentation adds supplemental data on recent trends and comparison to recent industry and segment results.",
         "Joining me on the call this morning is Bruce Haase, Chief Executive Officer and Brian Nicholson, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks by Bruce and Brian, there will be a question-and-answer session.",
         "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of our discussions today will contain forward-looking statements, including a discussion of our 2020 outlook for certain items and expectations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made today speak only as of today. The factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking statements are discussed in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020 and our Form 10-Q filed yesterday evening with the SEC. In addition, on today\u2019s call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. More information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of those comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and Form 10-Q filed yesterday evening with the SEC.",
         "We also refer to RevPAR index, which refers to a percentage score calculated by comparing RevPAR on a comparable system-wide basis to an aggregate RevPAR of a group of competing hotels, generally in the same market based on a weighted average of individual property results.",
         "And with that, I will turn it over to Bruce."

            "Just a question on I guess how we should think about the recovery. Obviously, you guys have increased your Extended Stay business a lot, but in kind of prior to RevPAR and EBITDA time periods, there wasn\u2019t transient business. So do you need to change in business to get back to kind of prior peak RevPAR and EBITDA or can you kind of get there exclusively through remaining through the Extended Stay segments of the business?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Hi, thanks for your questions. Yes, transient business will always be part of the business model. I think the company relied a bit too much on transient business in the past, it was up to 35% of our mix and that was really quite stressful for the business and the operations. Transient business, our goal is to be around, 20%, 25% to fill in the gaps. And I think that\u2019s our long-term goal. And certainly, in terms of profitability, I think that mix will be more profitable for us in the long -term. And in terms of RevPAR, I think you will also see our ability to get back to peak RevPAR performance without as much transient business as we had in the past. That\u2019s been demonstrated by some of our franchisees. Pre-pandemic, they were operating at levels similar to us in terms of transient business they made that shift prior to the pandemic and demonstrated positive RevPAR performance, which has also helped them throughout this period.

I think the \u2013 Anthony the pre-pandemic, as Bruce indicates, it was our target to try to reduce our transient mix from about a third of our business to something closer to a fifth of our business. Obviously, since the pandemic has happened that has helped us to reach those goals faster than we would have otherwise, but we intend to hold serve and to continue to build out business from here with that mix that is really more optimal for our operating model."

      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, sure. I mean, when the pandemic hit, that was the first place we went. We went to the 30-day plus business because we knew that the more residential business would grow during uncertain times and that\u2019s exactly what we did early on sort of the March timeframe, we really leaned into some highly discounted residential rates. We have a rate that is for folks that want to stay for 60 nights or plus, they pay up half of it upfront and that is a very highly discounted rate. Since then, we have backed off on some of those rates as our occupancy has increased and we have a number of hotels that are operating it 85% to 90% for those hotels. We have taken that rate off the system in favor of a higher monthly rate, which we call our retail monthly rate. So, the good thing about this business is we are very flexible. We can adjust in terms of revenue management strategies as we see changing market dynamics. And through this pandemic, our markets have been very \u2013 there is a lot of volatility out there. We have a number of markets \u2013 actually we have 4 markets that are actually positive RevPAR performance year-to-date, including Charlotte, which is pretty amazing. And as we said, in the remarks, we also have a number of markets that are positive RevPAR performance in the month of July. On the other hand, we obviously have some markets that are negative and many markets that have opened up and reclosed or have some other local issues. So, it\u2019s a very local business and that\u2019s why we have a revenue management staff in the field and headquarters that can manage those local dynamics and maximize performance as things change."

            "Anthony, one other thing I would add and I think this is just highlights the flexibility that Bruce mentioned. We have mentioned prior that we changed our incentive programs, rather than tying those incentive programs to budget performance, we began incenting our field personnel, our sales personnel to generate 30 plus business and for the hotels for groups of hotels for which they were responsible, essentially gave them targets that ticked up month-to-month in terms of 30 plus business. We have identified enough project business that we have actually changed that incentive now beginning in July to incent people to produce more 7 plus business. So it\u2019s not just to focus on that residential, but it\u2019s really more true Extended Stay for a week or longer."

And then as you are talking to them through this process, do you think financing or anything like that has become more of an issue and how you think about that the cadence of your pipeline going forward?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Franchising continues to be a major strategic initiative for us. As we mentioned in the remarks, we have hired a number of people in franchise service and franchise development in the second quarter, all the industry veterans who know the industry and particularly know the Extended Stay segment. So, this is \u2013 it\u2019s a difficult time for franchising, but we are not backing away from it in anyway, shape or form and we are committed to that segment of the business. What we are seeing right now is, we are seeing a lot of conversion interest. Unfortunately, the universe of convertible product to Extended Stay is not as large as the universe for our transient competitors, but there is still product out there. Many of these owners or potential owners are looking to transact in terms of the change of control from the current ownership. Many of those are coming to us. We are seeing Candlewood potential conversions, Hawthorne potential conversions, TownePlace Suites potential conversions, some other brands as well. On the new build side, we have a lot of interest. But again, there is some folks that have access to capital, but many don\u2019t. And I would say, those conversations are longer down the road."

I think, the main way we can influence margin is obviously the shift of mix from transient to more Extended Stay business in more normal times. Right now, we have seen some savings through breakfast that was offset by further expenses from PP&E. We have seen labor savings from less transient business, labor savings from less frequent cleaning of rooms for long stay guests, closing down some amenities. Wage pressure potentially could abate a bit in the future. We haven\u2019t seen that yet, but that is a possibility."

How does the potential online learning and kids not going back to school, do you think this helps, hurts or is indifferent in terms of what you normally see in a September month from a RevPAR standpoint, do you think this dynamic could kind of change anything when we get into that period?

            "Thanks, Chad. That\u2019s a very good question. As we have hinted, we are comfortable guiding to third quarter and the \u2013 basically the width of the range in third quarter is driven in large part by exactly those kinds of questions about September. I think a case could be made that an online learning environment in most of the markets around the country will be a little bit more disruptive to business travel. I think you could also make the case that we continued to grow our business, especially within groups and types of business back in the May-June timeframe when online learning was already prevalent. And so I have some confidence in our team out in the field that they can continue to identify and bring that business into our hotels despite the online learning environment. As we move further into 2020, I think the \u2013 there are more items of concern, you get into a Presidential election season that can \u2013 there can be just a lot of unknowns around what\u2019s going on? And then when we get back into more people indoors and less exposure to sunlight, less vitamin D, who knows what happened to case counts. And so, we do \u2013 we are going to watch these things very, very carefully. Fortunately, we have a tremendous number of hotels around the country. We are in every major market, except the Wahoo within the United States. We have the ability to really watch carefully to see what\u2019s working to apply learnings from one part of the country to another. And so yes, I think ultimately the business response there lies in resilience."

            "Yes. The only thing \u2013 yes, I agree with everything Brian said. The only thing I would like to add is that, you need to think differently about our business customers and traditional business. I mean, the folks that are staying at our hotels for business are not people that have the option to be on Zoom calls like the rest of us do. I mean, they have to be there physically to do their job. And I think that\u2019s what distinguishes our business travel from most other business travel in the lodging industry. They have to be on location. So, I think online learning regardless of how that pans out, that will continue to be the case. And just as an indication of how I would say how scrappy our sales force is, online learning having kids at home, that is going to create a lot of stress for people that have to work at home. And we even have an initiative for sort of offering I can\u2019t remember the name of it, but Jay use of our hotels and our internet in our facilities for the day or for the week for folks that need to get out of their house and have a quiet place to work."

We think the fact that we were that our net leverage was sort of in that neighborhood going into the pandemic has really helped us. And certainly the combination of that relatively low net leverage with sufficient cash on hand, certainly helped us to continue to move through the pandemic and to continue with capital projects, including on balance sheet development, which to my knowledge was not something that anybody else was doing during the depths of the pandemic. we, as you say, we expect to be or as we expect to be cash flow positive. A lot of that cash is going to be generated by the REIT the REIT will return at least 90% of its taxable income this year to shareholders. We expect that the majority of that return will happen early in 2021, when we have certainty about what the totality of 2020 pre taxable income will be."

And so that development number will taper and we expect it to, basically be over, certainly by this time next year in terms of the maintenance for the existing hotels. That number traditionally has been approaching $100 million call it between $80 million and $90 million in a typical year.

Those hotels that we converted are actually running basically about flat post-pandemic to their pre-pandemic performance under a prior brand. So, I think we have a very good story to tell. We are telling it, but again, a lot of these transactions are also predicated on a change of control of ownership. They are also \u2013 we have to wait for windows generally in terms of hotels to trade. So, I think it will be a little bit lumpy.

            "Yes. Hi, Smedes. This is Brian. The \u2013 really surprisingly for an economy that has 10% plus unemployment, we have not seen a lot of ability, at least not generally across the country to flex our labor rates at all. Labor savings that we have achieved year-to-date have really been driven by a reduction in labor hours rather than in a change in rate. Now, it\u2019s my belief that some of the feedback that we get from the field that the unemployment subsidy that\u2019s been in place here until the end of July and which is really kind of an open question as Congress continues to debate what go forward assistance should look like that $600 subsidy to existing unemployment benefits meant that people who are earning an hourly rate at a company like our hotels actually earn more money by not working than they earn by coming back to work at our labor rates. So, I think until there is an adjustment to that subsidy, a downward adjustment to that subsidy, where someone might earn 70% of what they would earn by working rather than 140% of what they would earn by working, we are going to continue to see a challenged rate environment. And there are a number of people who do want to work and there are people who give up on those extra benefits just to come in and do a job and be productive, maybe set a good example for their kids, whatever it might be. But we think it will \u2013 hiring will be much easier and rates will possibly come down a bit when we see an end to that subsidy or a reduction to that subsidy."

I was just wondering especially given your own experience there if you could elaborate a little bit on that outperformance either what\u2019s driving that, maybe geography differences in business model or price point? And then a little bit about just what might make up that segment of competitors, because I know for some of us who track some of the data in the space, getting crystal clear data on the Extended Stay segment is a little bit more difficult?"

What I would say is I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s geography, I mean, we have some very challenging markets post-pandemic. We are in a lot of coastal markets. We are in a lot of major cities in Boston and New York and Miami and the Bay Area in California and Seattle that are very hard hit from a business perspective during the pandemic. We have less presence in the Midwest, which has actually been less hard hit. Our properties in the Midwest are \u2013 were doing very well, in the Southeast generally are doing very well. So, I think the outperformance is not geography related again, we have some very challenging markets geography wise. I believe and I think this is true that our competitive advantage as being an Extended Stay hotel company is what has led to that outperformance. If you look at certainly some of our other mid-scale brands that are tied to transient distribution channels, they lost more and they did not have the ability to make that up, because they did not have the infrastructure to go out and find Extended Say business like we do. So, I really think it\u2019s that simple."

All of these companies, except for us, are primarily focused on generating and driving transient business. And so if you look at their websites compared to our website, our website is geared to selling and booking Extended Stay business. A very important channel for us is our call center. Call centers are not as important for a lot of these other brands, especially the bigger brands and the \u2013 when you are selling Extended Stay, if you are going to book a room for more than a week, certainly for more than a month, you are going to want to ask a human being about what\u2019s in the market, what\u2019s nearby, where are you going to eat, what do you do?

So, it\u2019s going to be a mix of both going forward. In this environment, obviously the national account business has fallen off, just because of less sort of gray collar business travel, I would say. We have made up for a lot of that in terms of the local business. So, it will be a balance going forward. We have both of those parts of the arsenal at our disposal. And as times get a little better, we will probably back off a little bit on some of the local business and add in some more corporate business.

Transient business has shrunk dramatically, but given that right now, it\u2019s about a fifth of our business as we move out of the summer and into the fall, I would expect that we will see some absolute occupancy declines in that transient business. We will work to try to replace that business with more Extended Stay business, but we will see how it goes as we move through the fall. But certainly as we move into the future looking a couple of years out, traditionally we have had occupancy in the 80s in the second and third quarters, maybe in the 60s in the first and fourth quarters and have averaged about 75%.

But mostly I am proud of the people behind the performance. I mean, this is results like this don\u2019t happen all by themselves, it takes a lot of work, it takes a lot of sweat. And our team has really come together. And I appreciate that. Hopefully, I think, to the Street and to investors we have demonstrated through the second quarter and through this pandemic period, just how different this company is and how much upside we believe there is in the future by relying on the key strategic advantages that we have and that no one else has in the industry and that is our business model and our exclusive focus on what I think is the best segment in the lodging industry. So, our plans going forward are going to be to continue to lean into those strategic advantages and we look forward to growing the company in a post-pandemic environment whenever that maybe, but again thank you for your questions. We look forward to speaking with you in the future."
