      "Kevin Tansley": [
         "Thank you very much. Before we begin with our prepared remarks today, we submit for the record the following statements. Statements made by the management team of Trinity Biotech during the course of this conference call that are not historical facts are considered to be forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor for such forward-looking statements.",
         "The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, will and other similar statements of expectation identify those forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the results of research and development efforts; the effect of regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and other agencies; the impact of competitive products, product development, commercialization and technological difficulties; and other risks detailed in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
         "Forward-looking statements reflect management's view only as of today. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements.",
         "In addition, there is uncertainty about the spread of the COVID-19 virus and the impact it will have on the company's operations, the demand for it's products, global supply chains and economic activity in general.",
         "So now, I will take you through the results for quarter two 2020. Beginning with our revenues, total revenues for the quarter were $16 million compared to just over $22.5 million in quarter two last year. Ronan will provide more details on the quarter two's revenues later in the call. So I will move on now and discuss the other aspects of the income statement.",
         "Our gross margin this quarter was 42.9%, which represents an improvement on the 42% reported in quarter two last year. This improvement was due to two factors. Firstly, the impact of lower instrument placements, which tend to have a lower average margin then other products, in addition to a lower depreciation charge during the period. You might also recall that our gross margin tends to fall in the event of lower revenues due to the largely fixed nature of our cost base. However this quarter, we were able to offset most of the impact of COVID-19 on revenue by swiftly implementing a range of cost-saving measures.",
         "Moving next to our indirect costs. In total, they've fallen by over $1.9 million in the quarter to $6.4 million a reduction of nearly 23%. Within this, R&D expenses during the quarter decreased from $1.4 million to $1.2 million while SG&A expenses from $6.6 million to $5 million. Both of these decreases are largely due to cost-saving measures we implemented in response to COVID-19 such as the furloughing of employees.",
         "So in the case of SG&A expenses, it would also choose the virtual elimination of travel costs and discretionary sales and marketing expenditure, including the costs of trade shows, many of which have been canceled or deferred. Meanwhile our share option expense increased slightly from $181,000 to $213,000 and that result was we're reporting an operating profit of $0.5 million for the quarter down from $1.2 million last year. This reduction is entirely due to lower revenues and would've been significantly higher had we not undertaken the cost measures -- cost saving measures, which I mentioned earlier.",
         "Moving on to our financing costs, which includes the impact of our exchangeable notes, our financial income for the quarter was $2,000 versus $133,000 in the comparative period. This is primarily reflective of lower levels of cash deposits. Meanwhile financial expenses for the quarter were stable at $1.2 million and of this, $1 million relates to cash interest element of our exchangeable notes and the remaining $200,000 relates to the notional financing charge relating to lease payments as a result of IFRS16.",
         "There is also the non-cash financial expense of $700,000 which is disclosed further down the income statement that relates to the accretion interest on our exchangeable notes and a fair value adjustments in relation to the derivatives embedded in those notes caused by the increase in the company's share price during the quarter.",
         "Tax charge for the quarter was $32,000 and this represents an effective tax rate of 6.4% of operating profit. The comparative tax charge in quarter two 2019 was $5.6 million. So this includes a charge of $5.5 million in relation to a tax settlement. In terms of overall results, the loss before tax and non-cash interest for the quarter was $718,000 compared to profit of $101,000 in 2019. Meanwhile after tax loss for the quarter was $1.5 million compared to a loss of $5.6 million in quarter two 2090. The basic EPS for the quarter excluding non-cash items was a loss of $0.036 compared to a loss of $0.266 in quarter two 2019. However, fully diluted EPS was a profit of $0.01 compared to a loss $0.179 in 2019.",
         "Finally on the income statement, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and share option expense was $1.5 million for the quarter.",
         "I'll now move on to talk about the significant balance sheet movements since the end of March 2020 and with an increase in property, plants and equipment of $87,000, addition for the quarter were $500,000 and this was offset by depreciation of $400,000. In the same period intangible assets increased by $1.3 million and this was made up of addition to $1.7 million offset by an amortization charge of $0.4 million.",
         "Moving on to inventories, you've seen that these have decreased $1.2 million and now stand at $31.5 million. Meanwhile trade and other receivables have decreased by $2.9 million to $17 million, both reflecting the lower revenues in the quarter. Our trade and other payables including both current and noncurrent are broadly static at $39.9 million. This includes $4.5 million related to new loan received under the US government's Paycheck Protection Program. Under provisions of the PPP, these loans will be partially or totally forgiven based on the extent to which a borrower's workforce returns to normal levels in the period immediately following the granting of the loans.",
         "On receipt of the loan, Trinity ended the furloughing of staff in each of its US and consequently we believe that a large percentage of not all of these loans will be forgiven later in the year once the necessary verification has taken place. Offsetting this increase was a $1 million decrease relation to interest accrued on exchangeable notes, as we made up annual interest payment of $2 million during the quarter and then accrued the next quarter of interest of $1 million. The remaining offsetting reduction related to lower trade creditors and lease liabilities due to payments which were made during the quarter.",
         "I'll now discuss our cash flows for the quarter. The cash generated from operations for the quarter was $2.8 million, capital expenditure in the quarter was $2.2 million, which represents a decrease of approximately $900,000 on the corresponding quarter last year. Then we incurred lease payments of $800,000 in relation to leased premises. These resulted in us having a negative free cash flow of approximate $200,000 for the quarter.",
         "Also in the quarter, we then had our biannual exchangeable note interest payment of $2 million and finally there is the receipt of the aforementioned $4.5 million of PPP loans. The net result is that we had an increase in cash in the quarter of approximately $2.3 million bringing the quarter end cash balance to $15.6 million.",
         "I'll now hand over to Ronan"

         "Good day, and welcome to the Trinity Biotech Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, that this event is being recorded.",
         "I'd now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Tansley, CFO. Please go ahead, sir."
      ],
      "Ronan O'Caoimh": [
         "Thanks and I am going to review our revenues for quarter two before opening the call to question-and-answer session. Our revenues for quarter two were $16 million compared to $22.5 million in the corresponding quarter last year which is a decrease of 29%. Point-of-care revenues of $1.3 million compared to $2.1 million in the corresponding quarter, which is a decrease of 41%. Clinical Laboratory revenues were at $14.8 million compared to $20.3 million in the corresponding quarter last year, which is a decrease of 27%.",
         "Moving back at point-of-care, our revenues decreased by 41% when compared to the corresponding quarter and the consequence of COVID which we saw the suspension or reduction of HIV testing programs in certain countries in Africa and this combined with supply chain difficulties caused by the major reductions in air traffic to Africa as well as general uncertainty as to how quickly COVID would spread throughout Africa led to a slowdown in orders. However, during quarter three we've seen a return to more normal levels of ordering and expect the outcome for quarter three to be marginally sort of normal.",
         "Moving on to our Clinical Laboratory, our revenues declined 27.5% to $14.8 million. We saw a significant reduction in our hemoglobin and in our autoimmune business due entirely to COVID. The consequence of COVID in many countries testing for nonacute conditions were severely reduced as patients were reluctant to visit their physicians or hospitals and run the risk of contracting COVID and then subsequently and consequently that they would opt to do fair or forgo such testing.",
         "It therefore comes as no surprise that we saw a sudden falloff in diabetes and also autoimmune testing during the quarter. For autoimmunity, this first manifested itself in our reference laboratory in Buffalo by testing volumes declined for example 90% in April. In the case of diabetes, we also saw instrument sales declined significantly with only 20 instruments placed during quarter two, as hospitals and clinics were likely to purchase new capital equipment in the midst of the pandemic. Diabetes testing and volumes also decreased significantly during the quarter.",
         "On a positive note however, we are now seeing revenues for both also immunity and diabetes return to near normal levels with the exception being that hospitals continue to do fair capital equipment purchasing. However, the impact of COVID is not only negative from a revenue perspective. We are seeing higher sales of some of our point-of-care respiratory products such as Legionella urinary action and Strep pneumonia, given the increased testing for these conditions in light of COVID.",
         "With regard to our life science considering Fitzgerald, we're also seeing significant increased revenues for our COVID monoclonal antibodies and our complementary reagents. In addition, the company is benefiting from sales of our FDA approved transport medium, which is a sample collection device for COVID-19 PCR and molecular testing, which is used to store the nasopharyngeal swab, which contains the patient's sample, allowing it to be transmitted in a stable environment.",
         "The Transport Medium stabilizes the sample and prevents bacterial growth and maintains its integrity until such time that the test is running at laboratory. As recently announced the company has now launches its COVID-19 IgG ELISA antibody test and is now free to sell the products in the USA. We expect to have the product CE marked for sale in Europe within the next six weeks.",
         "The product has demonstrated specificity in excess of 98% and sensitivity in excess of 95% in samples drawn at least 14 days of data symptom onset. These percentages comfortably exceed the minimum requirements of the FDA emergency use authorization partly. As the utility of this product is to detect individuals within antibody response to COVID-19 indicating path exposure and potential immunity, the specificity is the key performance metric.",
         "A high percentage specificity means that there are virtually no false positives and therefore for example, patients are not given the false impression that they may be immune. The test will potentially be used within the screening of people prior to vaccination to avoid vaccinating individuals who already have a circulating antibody response. Additionally, the test can be used to monitor the patients serological response in the weeks and months following vaccination as their immune system builds an antibody response to the virus.",
         "In addition the test can be used to prove further and individual had previously had COVID-19 and is now assumed immune and can also be used by governments to monitor the prevalence of COVID's immunity in population.",
         "As previously indicated, our rely to production capacity is a capability is a significant and the instrumentation platforms that perform this type of testing are available in virtually every laboratory in the world. So in summary, our quarter three revenues were autoimmune and diabetes anti-HIV would be below normal, but not significantly so, while our infectious disease revenues, which include COVID-19 products will be significantly higher than normal, reflecting significantly higher sales of our point-of-care rapid test and new antibody COVID-19 ELISA test the PCR transport medium and Fitzgerald-19 monoclonal antibodies. We estimate that quarter three revenues will exceed $28 million.",
         "Moving back to the development of COVID-19 tests, we have previously indicated that the company is also developing a rapid point-of-care COVID-19 test to detect IgG antibodies under the test can run in 12 minutes using one drop of cold blood procured by spring-loaded lancet or a finger prick.",
         "Like the ELISA test, this test will determine which individuals within the population have been exposed to COVID-19 and are therefore regarded as immune. We expect to complete the development of this test and transfer into manufacturing before year-end and again believe that the product is exhibiting performance characteristics that will enable us to gain FDA Emergency Use Authorization.",
         "We already have in place existing and substantial automated manufacturing capability for such a test, given that we have already manufactured -- that we already manufacture every year many millions of HIV tests on the same automated equipment.",
         "In relating to the FDA warning letter, as you would have seen last week, we announced that our Primus subsidiary had received a warning letter from the FDA following an inspection of its Kansas City manufacturing facility that took place in January 2020. Firstly we kind of say that we're obviously extremely disappointed to have received such a letter. And in fact, it is the first time that this has occurred with regard to any of our facilities during our 28 year history.",
         "The principal issue that was identified was in relation to our Ultra2 instrument, which is used for Hemoglobin Variants testing. This product has been on the market for over 20 years, making it the oldest Primus instrument operating in the field. In its letter the FDA has pointed out that certain post-launch changes and enhancements made to the Ultra2 mean that it no longer bear sufficient similarity to enable its initial 510(k) approval to be relied upon.",
         "In order to address this, the company intends to negotiate with the FDA to allow for a new 510(k) submission to be made within an agreed timeframe. In addition to this, we're actively preparing more detailed remediation plans in relation to the 3483 findings identified during the January audits and again, these findings principally relate to the Ultra2 instruments.",
         "I would like to point out that approximately $4.5 million of our revenues are derived from the Ultra2 in the USA as opposed to from the Premier 9210 where the majority of our hemoglobin revenues are earned. In addition, our Premier Resolution instrument which is already being sold in a number of countries, including CE Mark and it's undergoing the process of obtaining its own FDA clearance at this time is the designated successor for Ultra2.",
         "In fact put for COVID related delays in completing independent trials, it is likely that such clearance would have been obtained already. We now anticipate making the Premier Resolution submission by the end of November, ultimately allowing for the Ultra2 installed base to be replaced by the Premier Resolution new instrument.",
         "I would like to assure you that we're treating this letter with the utmost seriousness, and we're giving the resolution of the issues contained in FDA's letter to highest priority. We've assembled our highly qualified team who will spend the next two weeks completing our responses to the FDA, which will contain a detailed plan outlining how we intend to resolve all the issues that they've raised.",
         "And so at this stage, we could turn back for a question-and-answer session please."

So, I mean it reflects the fact that basically, we're selling a new ELISA antibody test that PCR transport mediums.",

There's a formal process to go, we've gone through with the lending bank and then in turn with the government agency, and just given all that at this point, we've taken a prudent approach and not recognized any forgiveness at this point. And we'll just wait until there's greater certainty as to exactly how that plans out. So at the moment the loans are included in our balance sheet as a liability. ",
            "Obviously, as I mentioned in my remarks, I believe that high percentage, if not all of them will be forgiven on the basis that we did bring back all of our furloughed employees in the U.S.",

So just waiting to finish off in two of the three countries, we haven't been able to get going again, we're hoping to get going in next month or so. But we don't have complete clarity on that. And then in respect of the rapid test, and we're virtually completed at the moment, we're doing validations.",
            "But the other thing that has to be done is obviously it has to be transferred into manufacturing and mold issues, et cetera, et cetera. So they're taking time, and then that new mold should be validated, et cetera. So because remember, it's going on to automated systems. ",
            "So what's actually holding is up more than anything else at the moment probably is actually the manufacturing side of things. But I think we'll be clear. We think we were satisfied we would be clear before year-end. So I mean the EUA, I think will come probably comfortably enough, probably sometime in November, the real issue is how quickly we can actually get off manufacturing and scale."

And as I say again, it's the broadest possible range of raising just and keeping with the spirit of those types of documents."

And we just we brought everybody back in. Now since then particularly in Jamestown and New York, we've got really, really busy with the combination of the antibody test, the development of it, and then now the manufacturing of it with the PCR transport medium as well. So we're busy.",

And we can't get in because of COVID at the moment right now, that I see in the first of September, but it possible I can change, has changed a couple of times, I think we will get in.",

And that's why again, for example, we have sold very few diabetes instruments over the past number of months because you really don't want engineers wandering around your hospital installing instrumentation and similarly, you're not going to welcome outside trials.

So it's had a good run and so the resolution is a much better instrument, you know as much more modern instruments.

There is people from Harvard that have been talking about it. So this rapid test could really be a windfall or could be really great. I mean you guys do with HIV. I'm just wondering it could be business even have it, so people come in, they can do a rapid test or does it -- you use that for care. Am I wrong?"
