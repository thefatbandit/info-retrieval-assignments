         "Thanks, Preston. PACCAR continues to provide excellent operating cash flow for reinvestment in future growth and distributions to stockholders. Last week, the PACCAR Board of Directors announced a regular quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. PACCAR has a strong balance sheet with $4.2 billion of cash and marketable securities, no manufacturing debt and an A+/A1 credit rating.",
         "PACCAR Parts achieved quarterly revenues of $824 million, and pretax profits were $152 million. Many customers deferred truck maintenance during April and May\u2019s economic uncertainty. In June, parts demand recovered nicely and is returning to normal levels. To drive growth, PACCAR has made consistent investments in parts distribution capacity and customer-focused technologies.",
         "PACCAR Parts opened two new parts distribution centers this year, one in Ponta Grossa, Brazil, and the other one in Las Vegas. PACCAR Parts has also made significant investments in its e-commerce platform, which is benefiting our customers and dealers. PACCAR Financial Services second quarter revenues were $360 million, and pretax income improved from $48 million in the first quarter to $56 million in the second quarter, reflecting strong portfolio performance.",
         "Used truck results were stable quarter-on-quarter. PACCAR Financial is increasing our retail used truck center capacity worldwide, which enhances margins. PACCAR Financial recently opened used trucks centers in Denton, Texas and in Prague, Czech Republic, and plans to open another facility in Madrid, Spain. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values commanded 10% to 15% premium over the competition. We have rigorously aligned costs to this year\u2019s market conditions.",
         "SG&A was reduced by 33% to $94 million in the second quarter. We are maintaining our R&D and capital investments forecast as we continue to invest in new aerodynamic truck models and advanced powertrain technology. Research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of $265 million to $295 million this year. And capital investments are projected to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million.",
         "Customer demand and higher order intake will result in increased production during the third quarter. Third quarter Truck, Parts and Other gross margins are estimated to be in the range of 12% to 13%. Thank you. We\u2019d be pleased to answer your questions."

      "Ken Hastings": [
         "Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Preston Feight, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller.",
         "As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. For additional information, please see our SEC filings and the Investor Relations page of paccar.com.",

         "Good morning, and welcome to PACCAR\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time.",
         "I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead."
      ],
      "Preston Feight": [
         "Good morning. Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley and I will update you on our second quarter results and business highlights. First and foremost, I appreciate and I\u2019m thankful for our outstanding employees who during this dynamic time have kept their highest priority on health and safety. PACCAR employees kept this focus while delivering excellent production and distribution performance in support of our customers\u2019 businesses.",
         "PACCAR achieved good quarterly revenues and net income in the second quarter of 2020. PACCAR\u2019s results reflect limited truck production and aftermarket sales early in the quarter that was associated with COVID-19. Global demand and production and aftermarket sales steadily strengthened throughout the quarter.",
         "PACCAR\u2019s second quarter sales and financial services revenues were $3.1 billion, and second quarter net income was $148 million. PACCAR delivered 18,100 trucks during the second quarter. PACCAR Parts achieved quarterly revenues of $824 million and pretax profits of $152 million. Truck, Parts and Other gross margins were 9.6%. PACCAR Financial achieved pretax income of $56 million.",
         "The U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck market is rebounding. Class 8 truck industry orders in June were 28% higher than June last year. Customers realize the benefits of low fuel costs and in many sectors, experienced increased freight volumes and improved pricing as the quarter progressed. We estimate Class 8 industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada to be in a range of 160,000 to 190,000 trucks this year. Kenworth and Peterbilt market share is at 29.6% year-to-date, 0.5 point higher than the first half of last year.",
         "In Europe, monthly orders for DAF trucks also increased as the quarter progressed. European truck industry registrations in the above 16-tonne market are estimated to be in a range of 190,000 to 220,000 vehicles. DAF year-to-date share is 15.8%. The South American above 16-tonne market is projected to be in a range of 60,000 to 80,000 trucks in 2020.",
         "In the Brazilian above 40-tonne segment, where DAF competes, DAF market share through June increased to a record 9.1%, up 3 percentage points from last year. In all regions, our market estimates assume that economies continue to gradually reopen but could be revised if their returns to lockdown conditions. We\u2019re excited about Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF\u2019s leadership in zero emissions powertrain programs.",
         "To date, we have deployed over 60 battery electric, hybrid and hydrogen powered trucks. DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth have battery electric vehicles operating in North America and in Europe. These vehicles are placed with customers in local and regional delivery, refuse collection and port applications. We expect these customer segments will be the first to adopt battery electric technology because they typically operate in the city and return home every day for recharging.",
         "PACCAR is simultaneously developing hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles and has built 10 Kenworth T680s for customers in the Port of Los Angeles. In the longer-term, hydrogen could be promising for long-haul applications due to its high energy density and its relatively fast refueling times. PACCAR will begin production of battery electric trucks next year. Volumes are expected to grow gradually as the cost of batteries decreases, charging infrastructures expanded and regulations drive customer adoption of these technologies. PACCAR is a leader in zero emissions vehicles.",
         "Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other business highlights."

Is there any way you could sort of give more color in how we think about that by region? I guess, would be my first question, which would be helpful. And then my second question, can you just sort of speak to channel inventory for the industry and where PACCAR sits with regards to channel inventory? Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hey Jamie, good to hear from you. Thanks for taking the time. Start with your first question on truck production for the third quarter first. We saw steadily increasing production through the second quarter and that really is a result of the good freight market that\u2019s out there right now. In fact, if you think about freight, you can think about the levels we\u2019re operating at are kind of similar to the beginning of 2018. So really solid levels of freight going on in the world.",
            "Our customers are profitable, fuel prices are low and activity continues to be high. And that\u2019s carrying our build up into the third quarter, as Harrie mentioned, and we obviously build to customer orders. So that\u2019s a good thing. If I kind of look at your second question and think about where we are relative to the industry. Through the second quarter, it was nice because retail sales outpaced build by about 10,000 units for the first half of the year. And that means that inventory, retail build are all well matched up right now.",
            "And we feel good about our position because we have about 33% of the orders in the first half of the year. I feel like we\u2019re in a good position right now. We\u2019ve good backlog, good visibility, and we\u2019re substantially full through the third quarter and taking orders in the fourth quarter and into the first part of next year."

Is there any way you can help us with the cadence of the improvement like how did Parts sales year-over-year exit in the month of June relative to where we started off, and I\u2019ll get back in queue after that. Thank you."

We did see Europe also increase its order intake through the course of the quarter and we\u2019re getting good order intake in Europe as well. And we\u2019ve increased build, along with that order intake in Europe, and we have good visibility. In fact, we\u2019re really full in Europe through the third quarter."

A couple of days ago, the month statistic for Germany came out and the number of kilometers driven on German motorways for which Germany collects taxes was only down 4% compared to a year ago. So it means that 96% of the miles were driven the same as last year."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Hi, good morning. Maybe you could talk about market share in Europe, DAF at 15.8% year-to-date. I think that was comparable to 16.7% a year ago. And then longer-term, if I look at everything that\u2019s happening in Europe with the Green Deal and all of the news in the last couple of days about their push towards hydrogen, I noticed that neither DAF nor PACCAR are a member of the Hydrogen Council or the Hydrogen Initiative in Europe. So can you talk about DAF\u2019s strategy for fuel cells and hydrogen in Europe? I know you talked a lot about the EV strategy, but a little bit more longer term, can you talk about what \u2013 how they might react to a hydrogen environment? Thank you."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Ann Duignan"
      },
      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Good to talk to you, Ann. From a market share standpoint in Europe, we look at that, and we have pretty good market share. We\u2019ve got good order intake. What we see is the relative positioning has been the shape of the market in Europe. During the COVID event, some countries were closed down longer, deliveries were delayed and different countries at different sizes of the market.",
            "So some of it is just cyclicality and timing of that as we see the market right now. When we look into the zero emissions vehicles, specifically around hydrogen, I\u2019ll \u2013 let me kind of characterize PACCAR\u2019s strategy there. We have a three-pronged strategy, which is really \u2013 first have to have the technologies, and that can be battery, electric and hydrogen fuel cells we come down the line. So we have great technology. Our teams are on top of all of the capabilities and are developing these vehicles. I\u2019m really proud of the engineering teams and R&D teams around PACCAR that have done just a fantastic job of having us in that leadership position.",
            "So that\u2019s one element is just being aware of the technology and having it on vehicles. Second element that\u2019s going to be critical to that is having good distribution when it comes to market. So a dealer network that works really well. PACCAR obviously is very proud of our relationship with our dealers and they\u2019re best in the world and do a great job. And so having the ability to sell and support, take care of our customers, that\u2019s a big deal.",
            "And then the third part of being able to have electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles is you have to have flexible manufacturing capabilities so that you can combined not just zero emissions but clean diesel technologies and run them down the same line, so you can maintain efficiencies and be profitable in that way.",
            "And in PACCAR\u2019s case, we have actual factories that exist and can build vehicles. So that\u2019s kind of nice. And I would say that specific to hydrogen fuel cells, where your question was really pointed to. We mentioned in our disclosures that we have 10 trucks we\u2019re putting into operations in the Ports of L.A., they happen to be Kenworth T680s, but we have a global approach technology, and we can use DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt, leverage each other\u2019s capabilities. So it\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s just where we\u2019re starting right now, but they can be applied in Europe when the time is right."

      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Great. Thank you for that. And can you just maybe then expand on the 10 trucks that are going to L.A.? How long does it take once you put trucks, these 10 trucks into pilot testing or whatever? What are the time lines? And what kind of time frame should we be thinking about before these trucks would actually be commercialized? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what needs to happen to go from 10 trucks to commercialization? Thank you."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Ann Duignan"
      },
      "18": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Happy to do that. The trucks that we\u2019re putting in the ports, some of them are already gathering miles. And those trucks are in a partnership with Toyota, it\u2019s a fuel cell provider there. That\u2019s going really well as well as Shell from an energy hydrogen provider. The time to production, commercialization, there\u2019s a cost element to that, which has to come into play. Hydrogen is $12 or $13 per kilogram. And in order for it to be really efficient from a commercialization standpoint, it needs to be in the $2 or $3 per kilogram range.",
            "So that\u2019s a little bit. There needs to be infrastructure put in place as well. And then the cost of fuel cells needs to come down. So we don\u2019t see that as something that\u2019s a near-term commercialization. We see that as a 5 to 10-year kind of a window where it might play itself into the market."

And so we\u2019ve seen good truck movements. So we anticipate good parts movement. And we\u2019ve got a \u2013 the team has done a great job of developing our capabilities, continuing to develop our capabilities. They\u2019ve put in place a new e-commerce system, which makes it even easier for customers to get parts the same-day or next day. We\u2019ve just launched two new PDCs, one in Las Vegas, Nevada and the other one in Ponta Grossa, Brazil, which makes it having the right parts and the right locations even better. And so yes, between the general economic state and our fantastic team in the Parts division, we do expect the second half to look really good."

And then maybe a little more broadly, you\u2019ve done a really pretty amazing job, I think, with decremental margins in the Truck business, considering how low production was in the quarter. And I know you talked, Preston, about some of the cost actions that you\u2019ve taken. I\u2019m curious as things start to rebound in the second half and presumably into 2021. Is there any reason to think that your incremental margin might be higher than the historical kind of 15%, 20%? Or is the stuff that you\u2019ve done more kind of temporary and we should just kind of think of the history as being a good guide?"

We always think about cost control and we\u2019re rigorous in that application, and the team did a great job, did a great job in a really dynamic time in this quarter. Controlling the cost, while still working on the really important projects we have going on. And so we made the right progress on the cool things that we\u2019re going be introducing in the coming years. And as far as its relationship to incremental margins, we\u2019ll watch how the market goes as we look into the out phase and see where that goes. And some of the stuff is structural and some of it is depending on what we want to spend the money on and where there\u2019s a good return."

And are there any different configurations that we should be thinking about, whether we\u2019re talking about trucks in Europe versus U.S. versus different fuel cell type applications that might lend itself to a different engineering design? Can you just expand on those points, please?"

So the most important thing for us is to be abreast, involved with, partnered with great companies like we have our great relationship with the current supply base and watching how it develops. There\u2019ll be some invention. There\u2019ll be some cost downs during the coming few years.",

Can you just talk about how many \u2013 how much of that was driven by furloughs or on that item specifically, I think you addressed the gross margin performance previously, but can you talk about how much of the SG&A reduction stays with us here as production recovers?"

And I know there was the $50 million engine hit to the first quarter. But just trying to triangulate volume versus gross margin. I mean the first quarter had over 38,000 deliveries. This quarter just had 18,000. To have the third quarter gross margin above the first quarter when you ship the 38,000, I\u2019m just trying to understand somewhat implicitly, I mean, the number that should be above 30,000 units. But even then, you would still need pretty strong mix be within the geographies, the type of trucks. And of course, you highlighted Parts should do relatively well. Can you just put all that together, just some sense of a better gross margin in the third quarter than one quarter. But again, you\u2019re not even half of the trucks that you delivered in the first quarter, in the second quarter. So we\u2019re all just trying to get a sense of, I mean, is it 30,000 deliveries, 35,000, because obviously, it\u2019s impressive if you can have that higher gross margin with that much less volume delivered 3Q versus 1Q."

So build rates are steady and growing, as we said. And at good levels and two shift operations. And we would see the third quarter looking a lot more like the first quarter in terms of volumes. And the Parts business is strong and strengthening. And so those things together are as you put them together, get you to that 12% to 13% gross margin range. Feel good about the third quarter."

But just one big picture strategic, you obviously got hydrogen, electric, autonomous, a lot of different technology streams that you\u2019ve been as you do using the supply chain to sort of leverage and evaluate and so forth. And you saw one of your competitors partner up more closely with TuSimple. Can you give us a sense of the time frame on when big strategic decisions might be made? Do we have to worry about announcements like that? Or do you think on each of those different streams, hydrogen, electric, autonomous, we\u2019re two or three or four years away from critical points? Maybe just give us a sense of how much to worry when or think about when things like that happen?"

That\u2019s what the trucking companies like to think about. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to deliver. And they\u2019re doing that, and they\u2019ll use zero emissions vehicles, whether they\u2019re battery electric or hydrogen fuel cells to do that. And so what we do is evaluate those technologies, develop those technologies and bring them to market as soon as they\u2019re ready and commercially the right answer or regulations ask us to bring them to market. We think that\u2019s \u2013 they develop iteratively. We\u2019re always making those strategic decisions about which way things will go.",
            "We continue to develop zero emissions vehicles while we develop clean diesel at the same time because that\u2019s going to be the mode of power for the coming years, primary mode of power for the coming years. And then on autonomy, it\u2019s a great technology. We have strong partnerships with a lot of autonomous vehicle companies. We have developed autonomous vehicles. If you look around at the space, and you\u2019ll see that a vast majority of the vehicles that are operating in L4 modes in trial are Peterbilts and Kenworths and DAFs. And so we\u2019ll watch that technology and when it\u2019s ready, we\u2019ll bring it to our customers."

How do you envision sort of going to market with those? Are you comfortable leasing those vehicles? Is that something that you\u2019re primarily looking not to carry on your books, just given early stages, uncertainty on residuals, trying to understand how you think about selling them?"

I mean we think the EVs that come into production next year could be leased or purchased, both are available PacLease, as you know, they\u2019re celebrating their 40th anniversary into the great leasing operation. So we can run them through PacLease, and we can also have the customers purchase them. When we bring something to market, we have confidence in its performance, and we do with the electric vehicles when we bring them out. The price point is obviously, at this stage of the development. And next year will be higher than diesel. But I think people are interested in seeing what that technology feels like in their fleets. And then obviously, we have regulations coming in the 2024, 2025 time frame where some markets will need the electric vehicles. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s going to bring some gradual increase in demand."

Just following up on Joe\u2019s question, when we\u2019re thinking about \u2013 I think a lot of your comments about the kind of the modest growth has come from the demand side. But can you help us understand what are the bottlenecks in terms of switching your lines to battery electric from an investment perspective in the factory? Are you taking a diesel line and just switching it to battery? Or is it more complex than that? And what\u2019s the length of time? And I guess, if demand ends up surprising to the positive, how quickly can you ramp those production levels on battery electric and then same question for hydrogen acknowledging that, that\u2019s a little bit of a longer time out."

From a demand standpoint and from a flexible manufacturing standpoint, it is really important to note, you\u2019ve been to many of our factories that when you look at PACCAR\u2019s factories, we build the order, they\u2019re custom trucks, they can be configured with various displacements of diesel engines or different numbers of axles and et cetera and et cetera. And our teams and our operations teams do a great job of being able to integrate different designs on to our main line. That\u2019s one of the real core talents that PACCAR has. And electric vehicles will be the same kind of thing. We\u2019ll be mounting them on our lines and whether it\u2019s the batteries, the electric motors, capabilities will all be mounted online. And we have flexible lines that can accommodate that in low and high volume. So we\u2019re prepared. It\u2019s really nice to have actual factories that are able to build trucks.

Or was it customers you haven\u2019t historically been exposed to, I think you\u2019ve done a good job kind of broadening the reach of your Parts business over time.
