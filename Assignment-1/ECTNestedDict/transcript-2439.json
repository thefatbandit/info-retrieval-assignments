         "Thank you and welcome to Shoe Carnival\u2019s 2020 second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today is Mark Worden, President and Chief Customer Officer; and Kerry Jackson, Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer.",
         "On today\u2019s call I'll provide a high level review of our fiscal second quarter 2020 results, as well as an update on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the impact that it\u2019s had on our business. Mark will then discuss our strategic initiatives and how our long term investments have already begun to pay off, followed by Kerry, who will discuss the quarter\u2019s financial results. We\u2019ll then open the call for your questions. ",
         "Our fiscal second quarter results clearly demonstrated the strength and commitment of our team, as well as the resiliency of our concept. When we last spoke we were in the process of reopening our stores and as we have said, the health and the safety of our employees and customers was our number one priority. ",
         "I'm very pleased to report that thanks to the dedication and strong execution of our team members, we have successfully reopened all of our stores, welcoming our loyal customers back to fulfill their family footwear needs in person. Our corporate office will also complete the final phase of our reopening plan after Labor Day. ",
         "Our results for the quarter were strong. In fact, second quarter revenues of more than $300 million established a new quarterly record for Shoe Carnival. Our sales were undoubtedly supported by our decision to not furlough any employees during the shutdown, as we were able to get our team members back to the store faster than nearly all our competitors. ",
         "Just as exciting, is the enormous growth we continue to see with our e-commerce platform, which delivered another triple digit gain in the quarter, even as customers were able to get back into stores. ",
         "All in, our focus on our loyal customers, coupled with our team's excellent operational execution, drove our same store sales growth up 12.6% overall. Looking exclusively at the days our stores were open, same-store-sales growth would have been 22.5%. This increase comes despite the dramatic shifts in back-to-school dates we experienced at the end of the quarter. ",
         "For context, in a typical season we see back-to-school shopping start in mid to late July; however, the pandemic has delayed start dates for nearly all the schools within the markets we operate. As we saw this materializing, we pivoted quickly and realigned our back-to-school marketing to correspond with the shift in the season. ",
         "Through week two of July, our quarter-to-date comps were up in the mid-20s. As we approached the end of July, we saw sales decline for the last two weeks of the quarter in the high 20s, as schools shifted their start dates which continued through the first two weeks of August. It is worth noting however that even with these two important weeks of back-to-school sales shifting out of the quarter, our teams still delivered the highest quarterly sales in the company's history. ",
         "Once we approach the revised back-to-school dates in late August, our comparable store sales began to increase, with sales of the last two weeks of August up mid-single digits. For reference, typically by the end of August, 95% of our schools are back in session. This year, as of August 31 only 65% of our schools were back. To this end we believe the majority of back-to-school volume will be realized through September. ",
         "We will extend our back-to-school season through the end of October to ensure we are timely serving our customers\u2019 needs. Despite these dynamics, we expect comparable store sales for August and September combined to be flat. Mark will provide additional color on this in his prepared remarks. ",
         "Turning to our e-commerce business, several years ago we made the decision to significantly invest in our technology platforms, including our e-commerce business and CRM capabilities. This decision is paying off. Throughout the second quarter we have delivered explosive growth in our e-commerce business, marking another period of triple digit increases. Moreover for the fiscal second quarter our e-commerce revenues were just over 20% of total company revenue, exceeding our three year target level. In addition, our Shoe Perks loyalty program achieved a critical milestone surpassing 25 million members and our Gold membership grew double digits. ",
         "Looking at comparable store sales by department for the quarter, adult athletic overall were up 30%, driven by strong growth in both women's and men's product categories, each up approximately 30%. Sales in both men's and women's non-athletic category were driven by sandals in the sport casual product. Not surprisingly, dress shoes were down double digit, consistent with a change to a more casual and active lifestyle as a result of closed offices and schools. ",
         "Kids comparable store sales were down low single digits with non-athletic up double digits, driven by robust activity in kids\u2019 sandals and infants. Somewhat offset by kids athletic down low double digits reflecting the shift of back-to-school sales into quarter three. ",
         "Our current inventory position is solid, yet lean, and we continue to work closely with our vendor partners to ensure we have the best product available for our customers. As discussed last quarter, during the shutdown we canceled spring orders and shifted fall merchandise to later in the season. However, our strong sales trends have us moving that product back to a more normalized [receipt] [ph] time period. ",
         "We're also working closely with our key vendor partners to replenish the categories and classifications that are driving our sales. We are very comfortable with the amount of inventory flow that we have coming in for the fall and holiday period. That being said, we do expect to end the year with the inventory down on a per store basis. ",
         "While sales have far exceeded our initial expectation as COVID pandemic took hold in the first and second quarter, the uncertainty it has created has been substantial and continues to impact our business. Our strong relationship with our vendor partners has been critical as we plan for the future, as the vendor community has not taken any chances with inventory levels; meaning, if its does not already bought, it is too late to buy it now. ",
         "While the current environment makes it difficult to provide clear guidance, absent the second wave of shutdowns, we believe we are well positioned to capture market share throughout the remainder of the year. We made quick decisions to support our employees, maintain appropriate inventory levels and enhance our vendor relationships during this shutdown period. This has allowed us to remain nimble and fulfill our customers need for both back-to-school and into the fall and holiday period. ",
         "Our financial strength and flexibility combined with our laser focus on maintaining an impeccable balance sheet has proven to be invaluable during these unprecedented times. We ended the quarter with approximately $77 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. We also increased our line of credit from $50 million to $100 million, to ensure we have ample liquidity if needed. ",
         "Our disciplined approach, as well as our strategic investments in our business have allowed us to make incredible progress on our long term strategic initiatives and will guide us through any unforeseen challenges ahead. Given the continued uncertainty as a result of the pandemic, we still believe it would not be prudent to provide guidance at this time. ",
         "With that overview, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Worden, to provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Mark. "
      ],
      "Kerry Jackson ": [
         "Thank you, Mark. As Cliff mentioned, this quarter was much stronger than we anticipated given the current market environment and we are incredibly proud of our team and their hard work. We delivered record sales of $300.8 million in the quarter, beating the prior sales record set in the third quarter of 2017 by 4.6%. Comparable store sales were up 12.6% and our e-commerce business sustained as triple digit growth and represented more than 20% of fiscal quarter, second quarter sales. ",
         "Our brick and mortar store sales were negatively impacted by COVID related closures early in the second quarter and as Cliff mentioned earlier, the COVID related delays for back-to-school shopping late in the quarter. ",
         "Gross profit margin for the quarter was 27.5% compared to 30.6% in the second quarter of last year. Merchandise margins decreased 370 basis points, while buying distribution and occupancy has been decreased 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. ",
         "The decrease in the merchandise margin was related to an increase of 250 basis points in shipping costs associated with e-commerce sales, with the remainder of the decreased due to a higher mix of adult athletic sales, which typically carrier lower margins than not athletic. The decrease in buying, distribution and occupancy expenses was primarily due to leveraging of expenses against the higher sales base. ",
         "SG&A expenses increased $1.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to $68.2 million, primarily reflecting higher e-commerce related operating expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A decreased to 22.7% compared to 24.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to leveraging of expenses against the higher sales base. ",
         "The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was 29.6% compared to 24.5% for the same period last year. The rate increase was primarily due to the reversal of a net operating loss carry back reported in the first quarter due to an improved financial performance. ",
         "Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was $10.1 million compared to net income of $11.8 million in the prior year quarter. Income per diluted share for the fiscal second quarter was $0.71 compared to income per diluted share of $0.80 in the prior year quarter. ",
         "Now turning to our cash position and information affecting cash flow. Depreciation expense was $4.0 million for the second quarter compared to $4.1 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2020, including actual expenditures during the second quarter are expected between $15 million and $16 million with approximately $8 million to $10 million to be used for new stores, relocation and remodels. ",
         "We also expect to spend between $3 million to $4 million on upgrades to our distribution center in fiscal 2020 as we continue to focus on enhancing our supply chain. ",
         "As Cliff mentioned, we continue to work closely with our vendor partners to strategically manage our inventory. As a result, we ended the quarter with inventory of $298.9 million, which was down $38.1 million compared to the prior year or down 8.7% on a per store basis. ",
         "As of August 1, 2020 we had no outstanding debt and working capital of $200 million. Cash and cash equivalents were $76.9 million and our borrowing capacity was $98.8 million at the end of the quarter. Free cash flow was $65.1 million during the second quarter resulting from record sales, lower inventories and higher accounts payable. ",
         "This concludes our financial review. Now, I\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. "
      ],
      "Mark Worden ": [
         "Thank you, Cliff. I'd like to start by thanking our 5,000-plus team members for their truly outstanding performance and commitment to providing excellent customer service during 2020. While these last few months have been challenging on a variety of levels, our team has exceeded all internal expectations, driving our strategic initiatives forward and delivering winning Q2 results. ",
         "As Cliff mentioned, we see comparable store sales growth of 12.6% in the quarter or approximately $33 million, against the backdrop of a difficult external landscape. If we look at comparable store sales growth exclusively for the days our stores were opened during the quarter, that number improves to 22.5%, a substantial increase and a testament to the team's hard work. ",
         "The last several quarters we've discussed our four key strategic initiatives; CRM, branding customer experience, e-commerce sales and store development. The investments we have made are paying dividends, not only in supporting growth, but allowing our team to be smarter and more efficient as we serve our customers. ",
         "Our digital marketing and e-commerce efforts delivered results that far exceeded our expectations for the quarter. E-commerce sales grew 332%, achieving high double digit conversion rates and growth of over $45 million in the quarter. E-commerce revenues exceeded 20% of total company revenue for the second quarter, which surpassed our three year strategic target. For comparison, Shoe Carnival\u2019s e-commerce sales represented less than 6% of fiscal second quarter revenue in 2019. ",
         "Our long term revenue growth driver and customer engagement strategy remains to rapidly build sales in this growing digital channel. Very encouragingly, e-commerce sales growth has proven to be sustainable even after all stores reopened, continuing to achieve triple digit sales growth. I'm confident it will continue to be a meaningful platform of the Shoe Carnival business going forward.",
         "Investments in our leading CRM capabilities also continue to pay off. We reached many key milestones during the second quarter, which contributed to our double digit sales growth. We surpassed 25 million loyalty members for the first time; Gold membership grew double digits and remained highly accretive to both sales and profits. ",
         "The average basket size of a Gold member was $16 higher than a non-member. So converting our customers into Gold members remains a winning strategy and a high priority for us. Our targeted marketing efforts rapidly expanded sales from non-members in the quarter as well of sales growth of over 30% in this category. ",
         "Connecting with new customers and customers not currently Shoe Perks members and converting them into loyal, highly engaged members remains a key growth area for us. Since the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we converted over 1.8 million non-members in the basic members from these targeted connection efforts. We plan to continue expanding our Shoe Perks loyalty program well into the future. ",
         "Our store teams navigated the challenges presented by COVID-19 with excellence. We closed all 390 stores we operated during the first quarter to support the safety of our teams and communities we operate in. By June 1 our team have safely and efficiently opened over 95% of the store fleet and the whole chain by late June, while continuing to fill large numbers of e- commerce orders. ",
         "Store traffic and conversion far outperformed internal expectations. For example, in May and June combined, we achieved the mid-single digit store comp for the company, inclusive of all stores opened or closed due to COVID-19. The uncertainty created by COVID-19 did delay the start of our back-to-school selling season out of Q2 and into Q3. From a store operations, inventory and marketing perspective, we were well prepared for this shift and have solid plans in place to support a lengthened selling period extending through Q3. ",
         "For example, we pivoted our marketing investments out of a traditional heavy TV and print plan in late July and early August, into targeted digital marketing, social CRM and store experience elements. This decision enabled us to be nimble with our investments and react to school districts, back-to-school date announcements as they happened. ",
         "Sales trends have shifted later this year in line with our planning for marketing investments. On average, school district announced return to school dates approximately two to three weeks later than 2019 and approximately 40% are returning virtually. As such, our historical sales pattern has shifted out and is lengthening. ",
         "As Cliff shared earlier, store sales declined double digits toward the end of July and early August or flat around mid-August and began to grow double digits by month end. In our markets for schools of either fully or partially returned in person learning, we've seen double digit same store sales comps during the last week of August. The markets where schools have opted for virtual-only learning, same store sales comps are declining low double digits. ",
         "At the same time e-commerce has experienced an acceleration of triple digit growth. As a result, we anticipate total comparable sales for the combined August-September period to be flat with a continued momentum in e-commerce sales offsetting negative results where schools have remained virtually. While this back-to-school season is unlike anything we've experienced historically, it's far from over and we remain optimistic that Shoe Carnival will win market share and provide families with the shoes and accessories they need despite the date changes and uncertainties family face. ",
         "As we navigate the current environment, we continue to progress against our long term real-estate and store profitability strategies. During the quarter we opened two new stores within existing markets and finalized two additional store openings for the back half 2020. We anticipate these four openings to be the total for the year as we\u2019ve taken a more conservative stance on capital investment since the pandemic began. ",
         "Additionally, we made the decision not to renew leases on 10 stores that generated low ROI, taking the year-to-date total store closures to 12. We continue to monitor each stores profitability and sales closely with plans for one further store closures during 2020. ",
         "In closing, I'm inspired by the efforts of our team during 2020 and the continued success of our strategic initiatives. Tremendous opportunities lie ahead for Shoe Carnival as we continue building on our strong customer relationships and introducing new customers to the brand. ",
         "With that, let me now turn the call over to Kerry Jackson, to provide more insight into our financial performance for the quarter. "

I want to start just, or make sure I understand all the moving parts around Q3 with back-to-school and kind of what your assumptions are there. So I know that you said that August started slow and then it picked up, but could you give us a same-store-sales number for August as a whole? "

We are not going to give a specific number and the reason is it\u2019s not relevant right now. Because of the way back-to-school is going to be so much later than it was last year, a comparison is it only makes sense in our opinion by combining August and September together, similar to what we do with Easter. Because so much of our back-to-school sales are moving into the September we wanted to give you kind of an understanding that it started very slow. We picked up at the end of August and we expect to come out of the combined August-September relatively flat. "

You know Mitch, we\u2019ve always talked about the fact that our customer buys at need, and as long as there are remote learning the need for \u2013 the immediate need for new back to school shoes doesn't present itself. We believe that, and we've seen it happen. I mean as schools have gone back, our business have been outstanding in those markets and I think that's going to continue to happen; and I don't use the word outstanding lightly, it really has happened that way as schools go back.

So Cliff, I think you just said that by the end of September you expect all the schools to be back, but do you expect \u2013 and I just want you know to get as a sort of point of clarification. I assume you don't expect all the schools to be in person by the end of September, right. Your flat August-September combined assumes all schools are back and you know kids are back in school, but not necessarily that they're all in person. Is that the way I should be thinking about that assumption for that sort of flat. "

         "Remarks": [
            "Hey Mitch, it\u2019s Mark. We are assuming that the trend continues very similar to now, where about 60% of the schools are in some type of combination, either back fully or back part with some virtual and approximately 40% are in a virtual scenario. We anticipate that the schools that haven't gone back yet, there is a still large tranche of those particularly in the north east and north. As they go back we\u2019ll keep similar rates and if they do something of that nature, that leads to the flat combined back-to-school season that Cliff and I were talking about. "

      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it, okay. And then you know when I think about August-September being flat, obviously that's being negatively impacted by the schools that are virtual. Is there anything else that you guys are seeing to kind of compare that flat for those two months versus you know the 20%-plus that you were doing before? I mean are you seeing any fall-off because of you know stimulus going away with the enhanced unemployment or any sort of fall off in pent up demand or any other things out in the market. "

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I think the biggest thing we're seeing is the impact of the virtual-only schools. That's the key impact to our back-to-school and we're incredibly encouraged that despite that approximately 40% being virtual only right now, our e-commerce business has seen an accelerated trajectory during the last few weeks as kids start to shop and that triple digit continues to accelerate as that month progressed. ",
            "So we feel like we are well positioned to deliver that flat despite schools staying virtual, and with some progression of that, a more shifting to a combo or others. As Cliff said, once they go back we're seeing outstanding comp store sales results. So if it gets better than that, there is some potential to be flat. "

How are you thinking about those trends potentially continuing in the back half of the year, especially as we kind of move into a boot season. ",
            "I mean are you \u2013 I think you made a comment, \u2018if it's not bought, you know you're not going to get it.\u2019 So I'm just kind of curious how you planned that and when you think about boots, I feel like on the non-athletic side there was a lot of slippers and comfort things that were working for spring summer. Is that kind of also how you're thinking about boots for holiday, sort of more shearling versus you know fashion boots. "

I will tell you this, that our not furloughing our people allowed our people to adjust and move orders on a continuous basis, based on the way the business was progressing and the fact that we knew we were going to be reopening our store. We believe that we're going to be better positioned to from a boot standpoint than most \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say any, but most of our competitors who did furlough their employees.",

So I do \u2013 like I said, I don't want to get into what I think is going to be casual or fur-lined. You know that just in case a miracle happens and boots do become available, I don't \u2013 anyway I don\u2019t want \u2013 what our strategy is to be out there. "

As customers truly have made a choice, not just in our category, but many others that the e-commerce business can satisfy their needs. So we\u2019re really thrilled with what we're seeing and we think we're very well positioned. ",

While we\u2019re not clear if that is where it stabilizes with so much uncertainty, we're using that as a guiding principle for Q3, Q4, thinking that the business will stabilize from a revenue and a cost perspective in the mid-teens percent of total revenue.

I\u2019m taking a conservative approach until we get the other side of visibility to the pandemic and are not putting out guidance nor are we aggressively going after new store growth at this time for 2021. But we are incredibly encouraged by what we are seeing with the customer shift to us, our market share of gains in e-commerce, that you know three years we saw acceleration of e-commerce capabilities of revenues, as well as our stores as we talked about earlier when open delivered comp store growth during Q2.",
            "You know and when we exclude those as we talked about in Q2, delivering 22.5% growth for the quarter during a period of time when there is you know great challenges, our customers and employees were faced with it, so I couldn't be more proud of what they achieved during the quarter. "
