         "Thank you. And welcome to Tenaris 2020 second quarter conference call. Before we start, I would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information in this call. And that our actual results may vary from those expressed or implied during the call.",
         "With me on the call today are Paolo Rocca, our Chairman and CEO; Alicia Mondolo, our Chief Financial Officer; Guillermo Vogel, Vice Chairman and Member of our Board of Directors; German Cura, Vice Chairman and Member of our Board of Directors; Gabriel Podskubka, President of our Eastern Hemisphere Operations; and Luca Zanotti, President of our US Operations.",
         "Before passing over the call to Paolo for his opening remarks, I would like to briefly comment our quarterly results. Our sales for the second quarter were down 30% sequentially to $1.2 billion as a consequence of the rapid decline of the economic activity and the collapse of global oil demand, as a result of the measures taken to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world.",
         "Average selling prices in our Tubes operating segment increased 8% sequentially due to a particularly good mix of products sold during the quarter. Our EBITDA for the quarter, which includes $54 million of severance charges, was down 79% sequentially as it was affected by the low absorption of fixed and semi fixed cost and inefficiencies related to the steep decline in capacity utilization at our production facilities. Our EBITDA margin decreased to around 5%. Excluding severance charges, our EBITDA for the quarter would have been $113 million with a margin of 9%.",
         "During the quarter, our free cash flow remained strong at $402 million, with a further reduction in working capital of $446 million. Consequently, our net cash position at the end of the quarter improved to $670 million.",
         "Now I will ask Paolo to say a few words before we open the call to questions."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Tenaris Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only-mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]",
         "I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Giovanni Sardagna, Investor Relations Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir."
      ],
      "Paolo Rocca": [
         "Thank you, Giovanni. And good morning to all of you. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the diverse measures taken to contain it - continue to be felt around the world. While we may have seen the big impact on global economic activity and oil consumption during the second quarter, further recovery will be slow and this led to uncertainty.",
         "Many parts of the world have still to come out of the lock down, other are being hit by fresh outbreaks infection, and there is a constant risk of further waves of infection. While we are still far from finding a definitive solution, which would allow us to resume many activities that we took for granted prior to the pandemic onset.",
         "All aspects of our operation has been affected as we implemented action to secure the safety of our employees, complying with government-mandated restriction on activity, supported the medical response effort in our communities, accelerated digital integration and remote working protocols with our customers, adapt rapidly to an exceptionally low level of production and implement measures to reduce cost and working capital.",
         "I would like to give a special mention and thanks to all our employees who have responded and adapted to the challenges that we are facing with exemplary resolve and solidarity in these difficult times.",
         "Our second quarter results reflect the advances we have made in our plan to reduce structural cost and working capital and prepare ourself for the market we see ahead. As we prioritize cash flow over operating result, we have reduced our level of operation well below that of our sales to reduce inventories.",
         "And we are incurring a higher cost of operation from sub-absorption of fixed cost that we do so. In the coming months, we will continue to generate cash flow from reduction in working capital.",
         "We are currently more than halfway through our plan to reduce our fixed cost structure by around $220 million by the year end. And the savings are beginning to be reflected in these results.",
         "We're also applying suspensions and adjusting our workforce in accordance with the local realities of our operation around world while retaining the key people, which we will require once the markets start to recover.",
         "We significantly reduced our level of capital expenditure to $46 million during the quarter. We are maintaining investment in what we consider essential element for our long-term objective, particularly, in environment and in safety.",
         "In safety, we have made good results in the last quarter, and we are proud of the continued improvement in our safety investment - in our safety indicators so far this year in our effort to maintain a COVID-19 free working environment.",
         "Our sales during the quarter were deeply affected by the rapid decline in drilling activity in the US and Canada. The impact of the pandemic and collapse in drilling activity in Argentina and Colombia, as well as an ongoing slowdown in Mexico. With our Rig Direct model, our OCTG sales in these countries adjust almost immediately with changes in the drilling activity.",
         "The US, there are large inventories overhang, and wells drilled and awaiting completion and in oil country tubular goods. OCTG inventories have risen to around 15 months of consumption, and this is impacting the demand level and pricing.",
         "Our sales in the Middle East and offshore are showing more resilience. This was a particularly good quarter for us in the Caspian and the North Sea. In the North Sea, we completed deliveries for the remaining wells in Cozen, began deliveries to the Glengorm development, and recently won an award to supply exploration well for the Neptune, a rig field in Norway. These are all very complex development, and our success has been built on the outstanding performance of our product and the benefit of our Rig Direct service.",
         "In the Gulf, we are well positioned with good visibility in Saudi Arabia, in the Emirates and Qatar, where we expect drilling activity to continue to be resilient despite lower oil and gas prices.",
         "In recent days, we have reached agreement for two-year extension on our long-term agreements with NAI, with Petrobras and with Pioneer.",
         "We were also awarded a 1-year extension on our Section 232 exclusion for the import of steel bar for our Bay City mills. While we advanced with the investment, we are making in our Koppel steel shop in Pennsylvania, so that it will be able to supply bars to be city starting from next year.",
         "In the coming months, we will be focused on reducing cost and working capital, position the company for an extended downturn and advancing with our long-term strategy. This includes digital integration of the supply chain with our customers, where we have made substantial progress in the past month.",
         "Through our direct - Rig Direct portal, customer can directly load their order into our system, and today, 44% of Rig Direct call out request in the US are managed this way.",
         "Through our PipeTracer tool, we provide pipe-by-pipe tracking and traceability, which allow for more efficient well planning and supply chain integration. We've reduced pipe handling and fuel inspection in Dallas [ph] We are advancing system integration with larger customers in the Permian, Colombia and Argentina.",
         "In response to pandemic, we have begun providing well integrity service remotely to offshore platform in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Asia Pacific, and have reorganized our technical training service for online delivery. As customers seek further ways to reduce cost and streamline operations, they are looking on how the digital integration can reduce cost in the supply chain.",
         "Also, drilling activity may be starting to bottom out worldwide. The oil and gas industry continues to have a large overhang of inventories and production operation capacity, which will take an extended period of time to bring back into a more stable balance.",
         "Oil and gas companies have reduced capital budget and are postponing projects, which will delay the recovery in drilling activity. In this environment, demand for our products and service will continue to be deeply affected through the rest of the year. Eventually, the oil and gas industry will need to resume investing at a faster pace to assure an adequate supply of energy to the world in its recovery from this crisis.",
         "Thank you. We can now take your questions."

How much of that would you say is driven by seasonality helping activity versus the impact of achieving more of your cost reduction plans or other factors? Can you maybe just walk us through the thought process for the fourth quarter?"

            "Thank you, Sean. Well, what we are saying in the outlook is that we will see that the third Q is really the bottom of this operation and we should start to pick up very slowly. But we anticipate some recovery in area like, for instance, Argentina. Argentina, we expect that after negotiation of the debt, something will start to move.",
            "Remember, we had 60 rigs at the beginning of the year. We went down to zero. Today, we are probably around 15 rigs operational. There will be some pickup in the activity also for assuring the supply of gas needed for the domestic market in the next winter in 2021. This is one area in which we expect some recovery.",
            "We may imagine that also gradually, there will be some level of activity in the United States that may be also coming from this. And on our - in the rest of our region, we expect there could be some slight recovery during the fourth quarter. That's the reasons that are supporting our statement in the outlook."

         "Remarks": [

            "Just curious how you think about the efficacy of the cost out program so far and potential plans or thoughts around increasing or upsizing that amount of cost you could take out of the business?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, I think there is a high uncertainty in the evolution of the economy and the demand when the pandemic crisis will, to some extent, recede. So not easy to forecast the level of activity we may expect in 2021.",
            "Our cost containment is basically focused on reduction of our fixed cost that, as we anticipated, is underway. And we plan to complete this part of our reduction within in the coming two quarters before the end of the year. Then there is also the containment of the cost of the operation of the plant. Today, we have a suspension agreement in place, different instrument in different countries. We wish we are absorbing the cost of idle crews in different mills.",
            "This is a component of our cost that depending on our forecast maybe - may change. There are areas of further adjustment from this point of view, in the case that we perceive that the recovery will continue at a very slow pace."

            "Thank you very much. I was just wondering, just following up a little bit on the last question. Just thinking long term, how do you see - when do you think you're going to get back to a kind of normal operations? And I assume that will be a few years out, but how do you see kind of a return to normal?",
            "And in that process, do you see industry consolidation continuing, and do you see opportunities for yourselves perhaps to pick up additional assets in that time frame?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Frank McGann"
      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, I think it's very speculative to try to understand or to predict what's happened in this recovery. But from my point of view, I think that in some region, we may be surprised by faster recovery. For instance, the case of China, China is recovering very fast. If you look at consumption, the economic activity, production and consumption of steel, we have been surprised in the last months by how fast this recovery is proceeding. And this is spreading to some of the Asian countries. So this will - is a factor that will be important in 2021. How fast will - this will continue.",
            "Then there is the European and US recovery. There is some kind of pent-up demand there after the pandemia. And in the case that a recovery speed up the demand for energy, like in China and other Asian countries may pick up faster. But this, as I was saying in the beginning, is just speculative.",
            "Our operation has been affected today by the reduction in the level of investment of the oil company, but this level of investment is probably be unsustainable if the world requires a steady supply of oil and gas in - at a slightly higher level of demand. Our operation has been affected by the reduction of the investment in North Americas, from Canada to US to Mexico and Latin America.",
            "If the price of oil went above $45 per barrel and the Brent, we will also see some higher activity in 2021. But it's very difficult today to anticipate this trend. We are still in the middle of the crisis. And sometimes in the middle of the crisis, you tend to see reality with a more pessimistic view, but something will change in my view."

We were expecting, anticipated a number in the range of $100 million, $120 million so the rest, around $50 million is something that we expect to incur in the second half of this year.

         "Remarks": [
            "Good morning, guys. I'd like to ask a bit more details on what you're seeing in pricing. So far, the US is down about 25% from a year ago. In the last downturn, pricing fell as much as 40%. So do you expect - are you seeing a further decline? And also, what are you seeing internationally where pricing typically lags the US? And could that potentially be a headwind in the second half?"

         "Speaker": "Igor Levi"
      },
      "20": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you, Igor. Well, as you are saying, pricing, the prices went down during last year and continue to went down even last month. But I think there is not so much room for additional decline because of also the trend on the cost is turning, you look at the price of iron ore and scrap, the price is picking up. Something is happening here.",
            "I was mentioning before that China is increasing its production and consumption of steel. This is driving increase in the price of iron ore. Iron ore is close to record level. And so this is supporting also the level of prices in our market. For the first time, the price of hot rolled coils in China are higher than the price of hot rolled coil in the US. This is something that didn't happen in the past, is an indicator of the recovery in China, but it's also something that is having an impact on prices of all of the competitors - on the cost of all of the competitors.",
            "So in my view, there is not so much room for additional reduction in prices. It is true that in the State, there is an overhang of inventory and this is always something that could have some temporary impact. But structurally, I see that there is not so much room for additional reduction in pricing."

            "Great. Thank you. And then looking at your free cash flow, you've already generated $850 million in the first half, mainly from working capital. How much more working capital reduction do you think you guys could realize in the second half of this year? And what kind of net debt or net cash in your case levels are you targeting by the end of the year?"

            "This is due also to our business model, the business model based on the Rig Direct allow us to reduce our inventory more or less in line with the level of activity. So we expect from inventories and receivable to be able to generate - to continue to generate free cash flow in the coming quarter."

            "I was wondering, how do you prepare the company for the next 10 years? And do you still - do you think you will continue to generate most of the revenues from OCTG in 10 years' time? Or do you think this is the right time to diversify the business?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you, Alessandro. I think that we are getting through a crisis, difficult, obviously, to predict. In the meantime, we are in a long-term trend of concentration and redefinition of the competitive environment in the oil industry and also on the oil service company. We are an oil service company in this.",
            "I think that we are prepared to play the game in this segment and to prepare for a recovery. As I mentioned in the opening remarks, this level of investment could not support the demand of energy that the world inevitably will need when it will come out from the pandemic. So we need to be prepared to support a higher level of investment.",
            "Having said so, we are diversifying within our sector because in the end, Tenaris is also supplying other segment of the industry, like hydrogen or renewable, we are - we have an increasing business in that sector because in the end, also, for instance, hydrogen or CO2, CCS and capture and storage of CO2 are also requiring infrastructure. That is infrastructure in which we participate.",
            "This segment today is a few percentage points of our revenues, but is increasing fast. And it requires very special product and, it requires sophisticated product design for this, and we are very well prepared for this. So we think that we need to look at the long-term for Tenaris having in mind the competitive environment in the industry we serve, competitive environment in our sector and also the niche that are coming out from a different transformation of the energy industry, and this is what we are doing.",
            "At the same time, we need to understand how we can transform the way we operate, the digitalization of the supply chain is one point, but there is also a digital transformation of our industrial activity. And Tenaris has always been focused on local presence in different markets.",
            "And I think that this strategy is the one that we will continue to follow to be able to serve the industry and the place in which we operate in a world that may be a little less global and a little more local in some of the region. I think this fits with our strategy, and we will pursue this everywhere in the world."

And as I was saying also, we think we can reduce the inefficiency that is coming into our cost of sale because of the very low level of production by producing - stopping production and reducing inventory, we have a very low level of absorption. This gradually, when we will align again production with sales will also have an impact in reduction of our cost."

You're talking about low single-digit EBITDA margins in Q3, albeit with some recovery in Q4, you're kind of a leading producer in the industry. There must be a lot of pain across the broader supply base.",
            "I'm just interested in any sort of impressions you have of broader kind of developments in terms of capacity. And I guess, to the extent that any capacity is being forced out of this industry, is there any reason to assume it will permanently stay out even when prices recover?",
            "And I guess kind of related to that, just the US itself. I mean it's been a focus of your investment in recent years through Bay City, IPSCO. There is considerable debate on whether shale activity will be structurally lower going forward, I guess, for a given oil price. Just sort of interested in whether you agree with that? And what that kind of means for the footprint that you want to have in the US going forward? Thanks."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you, Simon. Well, the - clearly, we didn't anticipate the pandemia and the impact on the oil demand worldwide and the collapse of investment in this. But still, in my view, in the US, we'll continue to have a long-term energy industry. There will be strong, assuring energy supply to the country, and in this sense, the structure of our business and how we are positioned in Bay City. And so I think will fit with the medium-term recovery that we expect. But it is true that in this moment, in the US, you have a large stock of wells that has been drilled, waiting for completion and stock of OCTG on the ground.",
            "Now completion will pick up faster. Drilling will take time to recover. Because at first, the industry will need to complete the well, then to start drilling and the inventory in OCTG will also affect the demand.",
            "But over time, the positioning that Tenaris had in the US, it is very strong.

The structure and - of the network of service center is strongest in my view among our competitor.",

You already touched on the oil supply or the energy supply as an issue of national security for the states. I believe that this is planted and it's going to stay. So in this perspective, the shales longer term will certainly have space.",
            "Now it's going to be speculative to say now what space is going to be, but if you read any available report, it's clear that the unconventional, the United States, they are going to take their space again.",
            "The industry in the states, the oil and gas industry, as already shown in the previous crisis, they were fast to adopt and they came out, and they come out strong. Now today, it is true, capital availability is lower. But we know because we talk with our customers and they are fighting. I mean they are not going to stay, sit and wait. So even this is encouraging for us.",
            "And as far as Tenaris specifically is concerned, I believe that, as Paolo mentioned already, in a world that is going to probably a little bit less global, shortening the supply chain is going to be key. And all the investments that we have done are exactly aiming at that point.",

And just to complement on what Paolo was saying, let's remember that the first phase of the Rig Direct development took place exactly in a crisis.

On the first one, the average price, we expect that if we consider mix of product, mix of countries because this is a complex and the impact that we may have from a decline, the last reduction in the Pipe Logix, now that has also an influence. We may have, in the third Q, a decline, a reduction in our realized price. And this, let's say, you can consider that there will be a reduction in this for this third quarter and extending into the fourth quarter.",

It hit Pemex in terms of not only in the price of oil, but also in terms of the demand in Mexico. So they announced a plan in order to face this situation, which included several factors like production and taxes that the government is asking Pemex to pay. And they also announced a reduction in the CapEx of around 15% for E&P.",

So we expect next year to start to increase the activity of payments, but also this will be strengthened in moving forward by the coming in of the different projects that were granted under the Ronda's [ph] during the previous administration, which are going to be respected and they're moving forward.

This is where the - we see some strength in the order book with a good perspective for the next few months. Clearly, this is an area where the lifting costs are lower and the NOCs are financially strong to sustain the operations.",
            "So we see that the NOCs in UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the core of the GCC have adjusted the drilling activity in the range of 10% to 20%, and they have made decisions to delay projects related with high CapEx and new infrastructure.",
            "So we expect in the next quarter, solid sales, given the important long-term positions we hold in these countries and the positive success rate we had on the limited tendering that has come to market this year.",
            "Outside the Middle East, the situation is a bit more complex. There is, as you know, an aggressive stance of IOCs to reduce CapEx. So this will translate into slowdown of drilling and purchasing activities. This is - you mentioned about Africa, this is one of the areas that is going to be mostly impacted. We have a very good and strong first half even with pipeline sales, in West Africa, that this will not repeat in the remainder of the year. We also had strong Caspian sales in the first semester. This will also slow down.",
            "So the resilience outside the Middle East is much less. In Asia Pacific, just to complete all the regions will follow a milder slowdown as our premium sales related to gas applications in China will be less affected."

But if we see our fixed cost at this moment, we can consider that the percentage of fixed cost is around 70% and 30% variable. But this is without taking into account our saving cost plan.
