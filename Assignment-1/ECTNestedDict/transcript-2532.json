         "Thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. Earlier this morning, Alliance Resource Partners released its second quarter 2020 financial and operating results, and we\u2019ll now discuss these results as well as our prospective on market conditions. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call to your questions.",
         "Before we begin, a reminder that some of our remarks today may include forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are contained in our filings from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also reflected in this morning\u2019s press release. While these forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those we projected or expected. In providing these remarks, the partnership has no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law to do so.",
         "Finally, we\u2019ll also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliations of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are contained at the end of ARLP\u2019s press release, which has been posted on our Web site and furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K.",
         "With the required preliminaries out of the way, I\u2019ll begin with the review of our results, and then turn the call over to Joe Craft, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, for his perspective.",
         "Coming into the 2020 quarter, ARLP was taking action to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was crushing global energy demand. Specifically, we temporarily idled all of our Illinois Basin operations and our East Kentucky operation with the objective to reduce production to match existing sales commitments of approximately 28 million tons for all of 2020.",
         "We immediately focused our partnership on optimizing cash flows through numerous initiatives to reduce costs, expenses, working capital and capital expenditures. In addition, the Board of Directors of ARLP\u2019s general partner suspended the cash distribution to unitholders for the 2020 first and second quarters.",
         "At that time, due to these actions, we expected coal production and segment adjusted EBITDA from ARLP\u2019s coal operations to decline by more than half and the contribution from our mineral segment would be even more severely impacted in the 2020 quarter.",
         "And while financial and operating results for the 2020 quarter were significantly lower compared to the sequential quarter, ARLP\u2019s performance actually came in slightly better than we expected. I am particularly pleased to report the strong execution of our plans to optimize cash flow and control costs led to total debt reduction of $49.6 million for the 2020 quarter.",
         "For our coal operations, ARLP\u2019s decision to temporarily idle five of our seven mining complexes in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic led to lower coal production of 4.3 million tons in the 2020 quarter, a 46.1% reduction compared to the sequential quarter.",
         "Coal sales volumes and revenues were also impacted, falling 28.5% and 24.9%, respectively, compared to the sequential quarter. Lower coal sales revenues, partially offset by lower expenses, caused total segment adjusted EBITDA from our coal operations to decline 43.7% to $55.2 million in the 2020 quarter and that compares to $97.9 million in the sequential quarter.",
         "On a per ton sold basis, coal sales price realizations rose 5% sequentially to $45.56 per ton, primarily due to an increased sales mix of higher-priced Appalachia sales tons in the 2020 quarter. Lower coal volumes as well as higher excise and severance taxes and inventory charges grew segment adjusted EBITDA expense per ton higher by 11.5% to $35.95 compared to $32.25 in the sequential quarter.",
         "For our minerals segment, results for the 2020 quarter also declined compared to the sequential quarter due to reduced oil and gas demand amid the pandemic. Lower oil and gas volumes and sales price realizations caused total revenues from oil and gas royalties and lease bonuses to decline 45% to $7.8 million.",
         "Accordingly, segment adjusted EBITDA fell 50% to $6.9 million in the 2020 quarter compared to $13.8 million in the sequential quarter. Our minerals segment contributed 11.1% of ARLP\u2019s consolidated segment adjusted EBITDA this quarter.",
         "Weak market conditions and disruptions largely caused by the COVID-19 pandemic also impacted ARLP\u2019s results for the first six months of 2020. Total revenues decreased 41.9% to $606 million for the 2020 period compared to $1.04 billion for the 2019 period due to lower coal sales, transportation revenues and revenues from our mineral interests.",
         "Lower revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses and excluding non-cash items, contributed to an adjusted net loss of $34.4 million for the 2020 period compared to adjusted net income of $164.5 million for the 2019 period.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA for the 2020 period was also lower falling 56.2% to $146.5 million. As we managed through the current volatility, ARLP\u2019s efforts to optimize cash flows, reduce working capital requirements, and strictly control capital expenditure and expenses have yielded significant benefits to our financial position.",
         "Working capital requirements declined 29.6% from the sequential quarter as coal inventories were reduced by 862,000 tons during the 2020 quarter. These initiatives also lowered capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses, which declined during the 2020 period by 49.1% and 27%, respectively, both compared to the 2019 period.",
         "Through the entire Alliance organization\u2019s sharp focus on these efforts, ARLP increased free cash flow by $29.2 million during the 2020 quarter, increased liquidity 15.6% to $298.6 million and, as mentioned earlier, reduced total debt by $49.6 million, all as compared to the sequential quarter. ",
         "Although our total leverage increased to 1.8x at the end of the 2020 quarter, ARLP's balance sheet remained strong and comfortably in compliance with all our debt covenants, including total leverage covenant of 2.5x.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Joe."
      ],
      "Joe Craft": [
         "Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Brian eloquently explained, the first half of 2020 presented many challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic which negatively affected economic activity around the globe resulting in lower demand for coal, oil and natural gas. The entire energy industry, including ARLP, had to react quickly to the rapid loss of demand.",
         "Year-over-year power demand in the Eastern United States declined 7% during the first half of 2020 with coal-fired generation falling by a third compared to the first six months of 2019. Demand for oil and natural gas has also been crushed and the resultant oversupply has pressured commodity prices.",
         "In response, operators have curtailed production driving oil production down to approximately 11 million barrels per day in the United States from a high earlier this year of 13 million barrels per day. The reduction of oil production also reduced associated natural gas volumes as well. As we reported this morning, this environment exacted a tremendous toll on ARLP\u2019s financial and operating performance during the 2020 quarter and the period.",
         "The 2020 quarter was especially tough as we took aggressive action with ARLP having to furlough more than half of its workforce for most of the quarter in an effort to match its production levels to the delivery schedules of contracted coal sales for the year. Throughout the 2020 quarter, ARLP monitored coal inventories at each location and worked closely with customers to determine when it would be necessary to resume coal production.",
         "Consistent with this plan, our underground coal operations resumed in May at the River View and Warrior mines in the Illinois Basin and subsequently at each of the remaining mining complexes; Gibson and Hamilton in the Illinois Basin and MC Mining in Appalachia. All seven of our mining complexes are now producing coal. However, several of these mines are running at less than full capacity due to a limited domestic spot market and a seaborne market that continues to be sub-economic for U.S. production.",
         "While the pandemic continues to create uncertainty in the global economy and suppress energy demand, our customers have indicated their intention to take all tons contracted for this year, in most cases at the minimum levels. Recently, we are seeing encouraging signs.",
         "In the Eastern United States; improving economic activity and favorable weather patterns are contributing to increased electricity demand and coal burn, which jumped 55% month-over-month in June. This marks the second consecutive month of increased coal burn and pushed utility stockpiles lower for the first time since August 2019.",
         "Lower than average temperatures across much of the country have kept coal demand strong in July as well as with similar projections for August. We are currently targeting full year 2020 production and sales volumes to be 27 million tons and 28 million tons, respectively.",
         "For our oil and gas minerals business, prices are rebounding from recent lows and E&P companies are beginning to show signs of life, particularly in the Permian Basin where drilling activity has stabilized and we are seeing many shut-in wells returning to production and a meaningful increase in already drilled wells being completed.",
         "Although uncertainties remain, these favorable trends for ARLP\u2019s coal and minerals businesses support our cautious optimism that the second half of this year will be better than the first. With encouraging trends for coal demand expected to continue over the balance of the year and utility stockpiles currently projected to fall toward normal ranges by year-end, the outlook for coal is improving. The forward curves for oil and natural gas are also encouraging.",
         "As discussed during our last earnings call, we continue to believe that our results for the 2020 quarter are not representative of the underlying strength of Alliance. Coal remains an essential part of the critical infrastructure necessary to meet the demands and needs of our country, just as our federal and state governments decided when the pandemic first closed down the economy.",
         "During the recent heat wave, the essential nature of coal has again been made clear with coal playing a vital role in keeping the power grid stable and meeting surging demand needs across the country.",
         "ARLP\u2019s low cost strategically located, well-capitalized, long life coal operations will allow us to service the needs of our domestic customers as well as expand our market share as weaker competitors exit the market, and allow us to participate in export opportunities when international market conditions improve hopefully in the near future.",
         "With the reduced pace of drilling new wells as well as lower commodity prices, we expect our minerals segment adjusted EBITDA over the next several quarters to be at levels comparable to those reported in the 2020 quarter.",
         "Someone who has been in the minerals business for as long as I have been in the coal business recently reminded me of the benefits of oil and gas minerals ownership. Specifically, he said, ARLP\u2019s mineral interests are concentrated in the core development areas of the premier resource plays in the United States that are the primary area of focus for industry-leading, well-capitalized operators in these basins, providing you with a multi-decade inventory of cost free, organic growth opportunities. Your growth requires no capital expenditures on your part. You own perpetual rights and have very low holding costs.",
         "He concluded by saying, he has conviction that the U.S. will continue to be an important producer in the global oil and gas market and that ARLP\u2019s asset base is positioned well to be the source of considerable production in the future. I share his conviction with respect to the oil and gas and we remain committed to our minerals business. I also believe we are equally well positioned with our coal assets to meet the stable needs of our customers for many more years to come.",
         "As we continue to manage through these uncertainties, ARLP remains focused on the well-being of our employees, servicing the needs of our customers and protecting our balance sheet. We remain committed to making hard choices necessary to emerge from the current environment with a strong foundation that will return ARLP to sustainable growth in cash flows and deliver attractive long-term value for our stakeholders.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the call for questions."

            "Okay, great. Thank you very much and congratulations on the free cash flow generation and the debt reduction. A couple of just kind of quick fire modeling questions, Brian. I assume 2Q will be the bottom for the coal business. It looks like you guys sold a little over 12 million tons in the first half, implying maybe 16 million or so in the second half. In terms of thinking about the split between the third and the fourth quarter to get to that number, any thoughts or comments on how to think about volumes in the back half?"

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, I think sales volumes will likely be a bit higher in Q3 than they are in Q4. Most of that due, Mark, to the typical slowdowns resulting from holidays in the fourth quarter."

      },
      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, perfect. And then on CapEx, it looks like you guys spent about 84 million in the first half. Is that kind of the right run rate? If you look at the second half versus the first half, it\u2019s sort of a comparable number or have you guys been kind of taking stuff out so it would be less and maybe how to think generally about CapEx in the back half of the year?"

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "We\u2019re continuing to monitor our CapEx very, very closely. I do want to point out that as we do that, we still are taking a look at making sure that the operations are capitalized so they can run safely and efficiently. That\u2019s always been our priority and that won\u2019t change. Run rate in the first half is likely going to be higher than it is in the back half of the year. We are completing I believe our extension at our Excel 5 Mine, so you\u2019ll see some CapEx accruing in the back half of this year that may be a little bit higher than it was in the first half. I think when you look at our total capital and the bulk of what we\u2019re doing today as maintenance, really coming into the year we were estimating $5.04 per ton long-term run rate and I expect our result from 2020 are likely going to be a little bit south of $5.00 a ton produced. So hopefully that can help you."

And then just \u2013 I know looking out to 2021 in the middle of a pandemic sounds sort of stupid, but just if you could remind us of what the contracted position is for 2021? And then maybe any color about price per ton or revenue per ton in terms of what\u2019s contracted for '21 v '20?"

Would it be down? If you just kind of took a snapshot today and I realize 17 million on, maybe you do more than 30 next year, hopefully much more than 30. Any idea of how to think about price per ton next year or it\u2019s just too early?"

Hopefully by the next call, we\u2019ll have some more clarity. But we do feel \u2013 before we saw this recent rise in cases, we were feeling positive that volumes could get within 90% of 2019 volumes for the industry as a whole and that we could possibly get back to anywhere from that $30 million to $35 million ton range. But right now it\u2019s so uncertain it\u2019s just hard to predict."

      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, perfect. And then my final, final question, so debt was about 1.8x, so I think you mentioned \u2013 also and maybe I miss read it, but just in kind of reading the press release, it sounded to me like protecting the balance sheet maybe the number one priority. So as you guys continue to generate excess cash, is it right to think about the priority right now being paying down debt first and then \u2013 if that\u2019s right, then at what level are you looking for before you would consider resuming the distribution or are the two not mutually exclusive? I know there\u2019s a lot in there, but more around capital structure and thoughts about excess cash."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Mark Levin"
      },
      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, there are not totally related. I think that the need to be cautious is just the uncertainty of not knowing exactly what\u2019s happening in the economy, what\u2019s happening with natural gas prices. Natural gas prices have been somewhat of a major impact to the coal burn over the last six months and will continue for the next three months. There\u2019s some expectation that we\u2019ll see a rise in natural gas prices as the drilling activity has significantly declined in the oil patch, and that\u2019s also impacted natural gas with the gas price. So natural gas prices are a key issue going forward as well as the LNG export shipment. So I think that back to your main point, yes, our number one focus is to protect the balance sheet. During this time of uncertainly, it was best just to pull the distribution back, pay down the debt. And then once we get clarity to hopefully get some stability and predictability in demand, then we can reassess exactly where we\u2019d go from there."

In August, River View will be back to 10 units, which is where it was before the pandemic hit. So it\u2019s going to be up to normal capacity. Mettiki\u2019s running at full capacity. Excel 5 MC operation, we\u2019ve been moving to a new reserve. We\u2019ve had one unit installed in June. We\u2019ve got another one coming up pretty soon. And then the third should be up and running whereby mid-August. And it is designed for a three-unit coal mine. Then that should be running at full capacity at the end of the year. So where we\u2019ve been short, Tunnel Ridge continues to work at reduced shifts and Hamilton has worked at reduced shifts and our Gibson operation, Indiana market\u2019s been oversupplied and that\u2019s running at reduced shifts. And all three of those are very low cost operations. So we would expect that all our operations as we see it today, we\u2019re hopeful that there\u2019s continued opportunities for those mines."

And whether that will in fact happen or not is I would have thought there would have been more activity before now, but it hasn\u2019t happened and I can\u2019t explain to you why. But I do believe it\u2019s needed. I think that \u2013 and I\u2019ve mentioned this also the issue with what\u2019s going on with Arch and Peabody, I just don\u2019t understand that as to why that\u2019s happening. It\u2019s obvious that we\u2019re in a consolidating industry and we need that to have low cost so we can compete with natural gas. It\u2019s just so obviously, but sometimes it takes time."

Stockpile levels, they seem kind of fairly elevated as of the most recent EBITDA that we\u2019ve been able to look at, but what\u2019s your perspective and June obviously appear to be a much stronger burn month with the heat wave and would appreciate your perspective on the recent burn? And then also kind of how this may lead to increased contracting activity for 2021 and the back half of the year? Thank you."

      "25": {
         "Remarks": [
            "All right. So, yes, the recent burn and the projected burn through August has definitely been a pleasant experience right now, given the experience we\u2019ve had over the last three months where there have been deferrals, now there\u2019s accelerations. August will be a higher shipping month in quite some time. July should be equal to what March was. So we\u2019re feeling good about third quarter shipments and the need for our customers to replenish stockpiles. Those stockpiles for our major customers in most cases are declining with one exception I think and that\u2019s just a decision they\u2019ve made to honor the contract. And so they came back to us and wanted to take their full contract this year instead of deferring some tons. But in most cases, as far as our customer base, there are declining inventories and we have had conversations preliminarily as to what their expectations, demand, projections are for next year. They too have the same uncertainties we do, but I think that \u2013 you know that there are several solicitations that are going to be coming out in the September-October timeframe and again we\u2019re hopeful that we can get back to somewhere close to 2019 levels in 2021, and that\u2019s based on domestic sales only. It does not include any export sales. And that\u2019s based on conversations with customers on their anticipated burn."

I think that it\u2019s fair to say that the contracts that are rolling off, they are high priced than the current market so there will be pressure on the top line. We\u2019re hopeful with some of our cost reduction measures that we can make up some of that margin, but there will be an impact on margin. Don\u2019t know exactly what and how much, but suggest that our margins will be at the same level next year compared to this year absent the COVID-19. You\u2019ve got to sort of take the second quarter out of the picture because our cost went up primarily because of lack of volume. So when we\u2019re looking at our cost the second half of the year versus the first half, we think we\u2019ll be going back to what are more traditional levels and more high 20% margins in the second half. So you got to look at both the cost and the revenue side. Revenue is going to pressured some, but hopefully we can make some of that up on the cost side."

We\u2019re planning to sell 28 million tons this year, so we have 17 million tons committed. If we were at the same rate, we\u2019d have 11.

And what\u2019s natural gas prices going to be and what other opportunities we have to deploy capital? So we\u2019re trying to manage through this the best we can, trying to protect the balance sheet so that we can be prepared for both the good and the bad. So it\u2019s the old saying, prepare for the worst and plan for the best. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. So we\u2019re trying to position ourselves to where we will be able to get through this and be stronger for it and also be in a position to make prudent investments along the way. And we understand the benefit of the distribution for our shareholder base. I think for 20 years we had long-term stable cash flow with growing distributions, and it\u2019s our expectation that that will continue as soon as we get predictability in those cash flows so that when we do in fact start the distributions back that they\u2019ll be sustainable and be somewhat predictable."

And given the uncertain environment that we\u2019re in, I think our \u2013 at this point in time, our focus on debt reduction will continue to be around the revolver.

And right now if you would look at the prices for the met market, they would be down year-over-year '21 versus '20. So we\u2019ll have to see how that develops. I think on the export markets, we have seen the dollar depreciate recently. I think it\u2019s in a two-month low part. I\u2019ve seen projections among the various banks that suggest that that\u2019s going to continue. So the second half of next year potentially has no 10% decline, so all that would help the export market. I guess that\u2019s one reason why you\u2019re seeing the API-2 show contango into 2021. Another factor to that on the steam side is the low natural gas prices this year versus next year. But on the met side, the dollar [ph] gets back to the economy and steel production continues to be rather strong really as compared to the demand structure we\u2019ve seen on the energy side as to what\u2019s going on around the world, the global economy and there\u2019s a lot of stimulus dollars that are out there. So will we get a stimulus billed for infrastructure plans? I encourage more steel production next year. I think it\u2019s a lot of money being thrown around by governments to try to get people back to work. So it\u2019s really hard to predict."
