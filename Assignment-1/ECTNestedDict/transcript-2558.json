         "Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to AXA\u2019s 2020 half year results. A warm and virtual welcome to all of you on the phone and on the webcast.",
         "Here on the call this morning from AXA, we are joined by our CEO, Thomas Buberl; our CFO, Etienne Bouas-Laurent; our CEO for France, Jacques de Peretti; our CEO for AXA in Europe, Antimo Perretta; our CEO at AXA XL, Scott Gunter; and our Group Chief Risk and Investments Officer, Alban de Mailly Nesle. So welcome to all of you as well. All of those present here from AXA will be very happy to answer any questions you may have on the results.",
         "As per usual, the Q&A session would be at the end of presentation and we\u2019ll take questions from those on the phone or those joining by webcast. Please just follow the instructions you\u2019ve been given. We would be giving priority to those who are joining by phone.",
         "It\u2019s now my pleasure to hand over to Thomas."
      ],
      "Etienne Bouas-Laurent": [
         "Good morning to everyone, and thank you, Thomas. The objective, of course, of my presentation is to go through the P&L and the balance sheet of AXA\u2019s 1H 2020. As you all see and know, COVID-19 is impacting materially our earnings and much less our balance sheet, which remains extremely solid.",
         "Starting with the underlying earnings, they amount to \u20ac1.9 billion. This part was already commented by Thomas. I would like to highlight one thing related to the \u20ac1.5 billion. It\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s completely consistent with the June 3 disclosure, which was made two months ago. This number has been confirmed during our closing. It doesn\u2019t mean that there might not be adverse deviation in the second half, but this is our best estimate, taking into account all the elements we have at the moment.",
         "If we look at the performance by line of business, Property & Casualty is, of course, the most impacted line of business by the COVID. It\u2019s down 72%, but up 3%, excluding COVID. Life & Savings is down 9%, hit by a lower technical margin, which itself is resulting from the COVID crisis. So it\u2019s an indirect impact.",
         "Health is up 7%, reflecting a continued strong new business and business momentum. Health is not the only one \u2013 only line of business going up. There is also Asset Management, benefiting \u2013 up 5%, benefiting from higher assets under management. And the holding segment is as well up, thanks to a very strong cost discipline across the board.",
         "Let\u2019s move now to our largest line of business, which is P&C. As you can see, our revenues are resilient, with hardening prices offsetting lower volumes. On the commercial lines, after a normal Q1 2020, the COVID crisis impacted Q2. The acceleration in prices highlighted by Thomas\u2019 introduction was offset or partly offset by lower volumes. And these lower volumes are generated by two things.",
         "The first one is that part of our insurance premium are indexed on the business activity of our customers. So it\u2019s a mechanical effect, notably on business lines like marine or aviation, it\u2019s mechanical. The second one is on SME clients. We took some support measures in terms of insurance premium to support our most vulnerable customers, notably on the French market. On the personal lines, you see that after a stable Q1, Q2 was down 4%, mostly because during the period of lockdowns, there was hardly any new business. So \u2013 and notably on the Motor side. So a pretty expected result.",
         "Moving to the profitability. The combined ratio was up from \u2013 it was up 6.6% to 101.7%. More than this increase is due to COVID-19 impacts. On the \u2013 excluding COVID, the combined ratio is down by 0.1%. It results from higher nat cats, 3.4%, slightly above the normalized level and certainly above last year, which was a bane in first half. Offset by \u2013 more than offset by, first, better prior year reserve developments, up to minus 0.5%; and second, by a very strong cost discipline. You will see that on all the lines of business. You will see that there is a positive evolution of our expense ratios across the board. I\u2019m speaking here about general expenses, excluding the commissions, that overall effects.",
         "The underlying earnings, excluding COVID, are up 3%, and this results from this slight improvement of combined ratio, minus 0.1%, excluding COVID. And on the other side, on the resilience of our investment income, notably in the first half, with an investment yield only slightly down by 10 bps to 2.7%, even if the investment yield might be a little bit lower in the second part of the year, partly for seasonality effect.",
         "Let\u2019s make a zoom on the COVID impacts, \u20ac1.5 billion. They are, as was said by Thomas, mostly impacting the commercial lines. While the personal lines benefited from a drop in claims frequency during the confining period. I\u2019m speaking here mostly about the Motor business. So business interruption is the most impacted line of business. It was expected. There are still some uncertainties related to the second part of the year, as you all know, on the legislative and litigation sides. However, we have booked some incurred but not reported claims to try to estimate what the impact could be, and this is within this \u20ac0.8 billion, which are net of reinsurance.",
         "The claims here are impacting not only AXA XL, but also France, UK, Germany and Switzerland. Even cancellations, 0.5%, remains bank in line with the first estimate, which was given with our Q1 release in May, beginning of May. The other lines refer to liability, D&O, travel and credit, where most of the notifications will occur at a later stage, we think. So it\u2019s still an estimate. And lastly, the solidarity measures of 0.2 are related to the support of our mostly nonrural SME customers in France, as I said earlier.",
         "Regarding the geographies, excluding COVID, you see that the earnings is up 3%. So it\u2019s a good performance across the board. The explanation are the following; the nat cats, you remember were slight negative. They impacted XL with the Australian events in January and the UK with the storms as well in Q1, a positive prior year reserve development impacting France and Europe and a relatively stable investment margin with some positives at XL and some negatives in Europe.",
         "Relating to AXA XL, you remember that we had a budget of \u20ac1.2 billion for this year, excluding COVID per construction. So you might have expected \u20ac0.6 billion in 1H. We \u2013 here, we show only \u20ac0.5 billion. And the main difference comes from the U.S. riots, which occurred and which were absolutely not expected, the rest being pretty in line with our forecast.",
         "Let\u2019s move to Life & Savings. Gross revenues are down 8%. But as highlighted in the introduction of Thomas, there is some good news in that because our capital-light products are up, I refer to protection and Unit-Linked while the capital-heavy products are down, I mean, the General Account. So \u2013 and this trend is true not only on the top line side, but also on the net inflows side. You see that the Unit-Linked, particularly, is a good surprise because in the previous crisis, we tended to have massive surrenders on Unit-Linked. Here, the clients, I think, were more mature and our distributors as well. And there were some positive arbitrage, notably in France from GA, from General Account to Unit-Linked. The General Account savings were down, particularly down, notably in France and Italy.",
         "Let\u2019s move to the profitability. The profitability, as you can see, is down 9% due to lower technical margin, partly offset by a strong cost discipline. So this lower technical margin, I told you in the introduction, is the indirect consequence of the COVID crisis. Why? First, because with the lower interest rates we had to adapt and update the discount rate on the annuities in France, notably from 2.5% to 1.5%. There were also lower surrender benefits because we granted grace periods for the customers, not respecting their payments. And lastly, in France, we extended disability covers for employees, which was direct and this during the confinement period.",
         "The investment margin was particularly resilient in 1H, notably due to very \u2013 much lower crediting rates in France. The investment margin might be a little bit more under pressure in the second half of the year. The lower general expenses reflect, as I said, the cost savings initiative, which we have taken from the very beginning of the crisis with the objective, which was shared with all the managers and employees of the company to offset the lower revenues with lower expenses. And I think this plan works pretty well.",
         "Let\u2019s pursue now on a positive note with the Health business, which continues its strong performance across all geographies and in both individual and group lines as reflected in the gross revenues evolution. The combined ratio was slightly up, which might seem counterintuitive because the current year loss ratio is benefiting from the lower frequency, which might revert in the second part of the year, but which was very, very good in the first half, and benefited as well from the strong cost discipline across the group. And \u2013 but the offsetting element was the less favorable prior year reserves development in some countries, not only in Europe and France. All of this with a pretty stable financial income resulted in underlying earnings up 7%, which is a great news.",
         "Asset management is as well going up. So not only Health benefiting from higher assets under management. You see that the gross revenues benefited from these higher assets, which are due to two aspects. On the one side, positive net inflows in 1H in both alternatives and core assets. And second, due to a market appreciation effect versus 1H 2019, notably on the fixed income part. And this \u2013 because the fees are lower on the fixed income side, you\u2019ll see that the gross revenues are increasing at a lower pace than the average assets under management. The cost income ratio, once again, solid cost discipline allowing a slight improvement. As a result, underlying earnings up 5%, which is a very good performance in the context.",
         "The net income decreased by 39%, mostly reflecting the high financial market volatility. Net realized capital gains, as you can see, \u20ac98 million, reflect two realities. On the one side, the normal capital gains we realize each year of around \u20ac0.4 billion a year, which is unchanged. However, here, higher impairments offsetting this good performance on notably on real estate and equities. The second adjustment is the economic hedges. You know that we have reinforced our hedges on equity just before the start of the crisis. It\u2019s reflected in this solid number with a plus \u20ac0.4 billion gain, the change in fair value is this accounting noise reflecting the mark-to-market of IFS P&L assets, here, it\u2019s mostly hedge funds and private equity. These values can still continue to fluctuate until the end of the year. For me, it\u2019s something which does not reflect the P&L reality but more shareholders\u2019 equity reality. In an ideal world, we would love this to be booked in the OCI part.",
         "Exceptional and discontinued operations is 50% due to solidarity funds, which are not tax deductible, mostly contributed in France, but not only \u2013 in some of the countries we had to do that as well. And 50% due to various asset depreciation. The integration and restructuring costs are related to the pursuit of the integration of XL by AXA and some restructuring provisions like the most notable one being in Germany with the disposal of our banking portfolio. And the goodwill and related intangibles are pretty stable from half year to half year.",
         "It\u2019s time now to move to our balance sheet, which remains, as we said, very resilient. Shareholders\u2019 equity is remaining very stable while the adjusted return on equity is subject to the COVID earnings impact. So pretty mechanical. Not much to say. The change in net realized capital gains reflect some gains on the govies and the corporates, mechanically as a result of the macroeconomic conditions. Equity is slightly down, but partly offset by hedges, which some part of them not being in the P&L. So the net income for the period and the dividend are pretty balancing each other. And there is a strengthening of the euro, generating a negative impact on the Forex and other up to \u20ac0.9 billion.",
         "I propose to move to the solvency part, which is certainly more weighted and expected than the comments on the shareholders\u2019 equity. So Solvency II ratio 180% pretty stable versus 1Q 2020, which was already disclosed at 182%, with, as was said in the beginning, upsides still expected in Q4, and I would say, significant upsides expected in Q4. So if we go line by line, the operating return is one point only in the second quarter, reflecting the impact of COVID in the discrete quarter.",
         "The dividend accrual for 1H 2020 was explained by Thomas in the beginning, we are accruing 50% of at half year of the announced dividend of last year, which was \u20ac1.43. It\u2019s not a decision. It\u2019s purely the continuity of the methodology we are using each year when accruing for the dividend to be paid in the following year. Market impact, excluding Forex, minus one point. To be frank, based on the sensitivities, one might have expected a slight plus and not a slight negative. It\u2019s due to the fact that the changes in market conditions in 1H have moved quite a lot and the sensitivities needed to be updated, which is disclosed here on the right-hand side. And the main factor is that with a lower interest rates level, the impact of the volatility adjuster on the corporate spreads is getting to zero. And therefore, the evolution of the market impact is been in the quarter, but might have been slightly more positive based on the \u2013 from the sensitivities.",
         "The debt repayment of \u20ac1.3 billion performed in April was expected as well, minus four points. And as discussed already and presented by Thomas, following the very strong statements of this ACPR and the very clear discussions we had with them, the non-distribution of the second part, second tranche of the dividend contributes six points positive to this number of 180%.",
         "Regarding the Q4 indicative outlook, I would like to highlight that the two main transactions running, which are the sale of AXA Bank Belgium and the sale of AXA Eastern and Central Europe operations is running well, in line with expectations. And so we are very confident that the disposal will take place at the end of the year. Again, the transaction had been announced in 2018 and there was a joint mutual agreement between Crelan and us to terminate the sales agreement. Certain conditions were not met by the agreed Long Stop Date. And therefore, given the complexity of the transaction and including the regulatory complexity of the transaction, we have preferred to stop it.",
         "We are working actively on alternative solutions to optimize the liquidity of this company, which we should not forget has positive cash flows, which are expected. So it\u2019s a profitable operation. We wanted to improve a little bit the solvency and the liquidity. So the solvency, we would have had a gain of one point, which will not get further to this decision. However, on the liquidity, this was a \u20ac1 billion transaction. We are working on alternative solutions, notably with reinsurance schemes external or internal to reduce the required capital requirements or the \u2013 sorry, the capital requirements in order to bring some upstream some further cash to the holding. So this objective is still valid up to the end of the year, and we\u2019ll keep you updated on this.",
         "Let\u2019s move to the assets. What we can say is that our portfolio management during the crisis was very active. So what we did was being very proactive on the most vulnerable sectors, notably oil and gas, travel, leisure, transportation. These sectors represent \u20ac11 billion out of a total of \u20ac169 billion total corporate bonds, 70% are rated A or above. And what we did was to sell around \u20ac1 billion of this portfolio at a value of circa 90% of par to protect the ratings of our portfolio and to try to avoid the defaults. The second \u2013 in the middle of the chart, you\u2019ll see that this result has been achieved. You see that very little has moved. To be completely transparent, there were some downgrades from BBB to below investment grades, which represents less than 0.3% of the total corporate bonds portfolio, which we think is a great achievement.",
         "Lastly, on the asset side, in the context of reducing interest rates or lower interest rates, we have tried to pick up or to invest in some attractive assets with sometimes lower liquidity, but a very decent profitability. This was the case notably in real estate, where we invested in some programs, \u20ac2.3 billion in France and the UK and in CLO tranches, so AA, AAA CLO tranches, with a margin of around 200 bps, which we thought were very attractive. This is how we can maybe get an extra margin on top of the core fixed income of 1.3%, and we are confident that we can keep a reinvestment rate of around 1.5% until the end of the year. It was slightly above 1.5% in 1H. It might be slightly below 1.5% at the end of the year \u2013 in the second part of the year. But as a whole, we are still targeting 1.5%.",
         "The reserves in P&C remains strong across the group. Reserving ratio is up, reflecting notably additional COVID reserving. So it\u2019s one indication, but it\u2019s not the most powerful and indicative one. We think that the most useful information is the IFRS reserves in excess of undiscounted Solvency II best estimate liabilities, which remains high. For the sake of transparency, we have reduced the level of excess at AXA XL, mostly on the non-U. S. D&O liability lines. These lines have been identified when we set up the figure originally. And therefore, there is no P&L impact in the numbers we disclosed. We continue to consider our level of reserves as prudent at the group level, which we think is very clear for everyone.",
         "I would like to finish the balance sheet presentation with the cash at holding and the group debt gearing. As you can see, the liquidity at \u2013 on the 30th of June amounted to \u20ac7.2 billion. It\u2019s \u20ac5.5 billion after the payment of the dividend in July, which we think is a more relevant number to be compared with the \u20ac3 billion of last year. It\u2019s \u2013 this increase is mostly related to the high remittance from the entities. And when I say high, it\u2019s business as usual, but it\u2019s high in the context of the crisis, \u20ac4.9 billion and reflects as well the reimbursement, the \u20ac1.3 billion reimbursement of the sub debt in the first half.",
         "The debt gearing reduced further in 1H, reflecting, of course, the reimbursement of the debt. It contributes to an improvement of 1.4 in the ratio. Regarding the end of the year, we continue to think that we might slightly improve this ratio, which we will keep, in any case, below the 28% upper range. We had set a target more of 26% on the 20th of February. Given the context of the crisis, we\u2019ll be below 28%. And I think this is for the balance sheet.",
         "So I would like just to give before handing back over to Thomas, trying to summarize a little bit what we just said on the P&L and balance sheet side, which that we experienced resilient revenues supported by hardening prices in P&C, capital-light products in Life & Savings, higher volumes in Health and Asset Management. Our half year at \u20ac1.9 billion remain high, but negatively impacted by the COVID-19 claims, consistent with our 3rd of June disclosures. Most of these negative impacts are related to P&C commercial lines. Excluding COVID claims and the consolidation of Equitable, earnings are up 1%.",
         "Lastly, our balance sheet remains resilient. We expect higher Solvency II ratio at the end of the year. We expect our gearing ratio to remain below the 28% mark. And since March, we have been very active in managing our investments portfolio, our cash position and our cost. And you can expect us to remain disciplined on this front.",
         "I\u2019m now handing back over to Thomas for the Q&A session."
      ],
      "Thomas Buberl": [
         "Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, good afternoon to all of you. Welcome to the half year results 2020. I will start with the key highlights on the Page A5, if you\u2019ve got the presentation in front of you.",
         "What are those key highlights? Number one, our business profile that we have significantly shifted over the last couple of years towards more technical risk, is well positioned for the current market dynamics, and you have seen it. The company is very resilient. We are benefiting from a hardening pricing cycle in P&C commercial lines and certainly also one of the strategic segments, the health business is growing nicely, and it reaffirms our strategic positioning and our strategic priorities.",
         "When you look at the revenues at minus 2% very resilient due to the fact that we had a very strong growth in the first quarter and that obviously, the second quarter was impacted by COVID-19. The earnings are at \u20ac1.9 billion for the half year, which is a very good result given the fact that we have been impacted in all industries with COVID-19.",
         "If you look at it relative to last year, it\u2019s minus 48%. If you take COVID out, it is plus 1%, and it is very much in line with the guidance of \u20ac1.5 billion of net claims from COVID-19 that we have given on the 3rd of June.",
         "COVID-19, as you well know, is in the insurance industry, an event, a crisis that impacts mainly the commercial line business. And therefore, we have seen the major effects in the commercial lines business, and a very good resilience across all other lines of the group.",
         "At this point in time, in a crisis that is challenging for all of us, the balance sheet has proven to be very resilient. This is also due to the fact that we have shifted our business profile, 180% solvency ratio is the solvency ratio at half year. And we are expecting upsides from disposals, roughly 6%, and also from the integration of AXA XL into the internal model of AXA Group in the second half of 2020, this is between 5% and 10%.",
         "At the same time, the cash remittance from entities remain strong. You\u2019ve seen that we have upstreamed dividend for most entities, and we have, at the same time, reduced the debt gearing to the debt gearing range of 25% to 28% that we have aimed to be in by the end of 2020.",
         "You have certainly also seen that our regulator, the ACPR, has issued a second communication around dividends on July 28. Their first communication in the month of May was around postponing dividends from being paid in April to October. This most recent communication was about not paying dividend for the whole year, for rest of the year 2020. Therefore, to be in alignment with this very different position of the ACPR, the Board of Directors has decided not to distribute the exceptional reserve to shareholders that we have built, and this is also very much in line with the communication of the 3rd of June, where we have said 50% of the dividend is being paid. The second half is being subject to the regulatory financial and economic environment. And here, we\u2019ve clearly got a change in the regulatory environment in that the ACPR or regulator has expressed themselves much earlier than we thought on the question around dividend for the rest of the year.",
         "If you go to the Slide A6, you see the growth of the minus 2% in revenue, split up by the different lines of business. P&C is slightly down. This is due to the fact that we had a confinement and that activity was certainly very limited for many of our customers. Health business has been performing very well. As I said earlier, one of the strategic pillars of AXA, and we feel very comfortable and also confirmed in pursuing our strategic efforts to strengthen and grow our health business. Life & Savings has been the business that has been going back the most, minus 8%. However, if you look into the mix of this minus 8%, you see that the majority of the reduction is in the general account business and that the unit-linked business and the protection business has performed well despite the fact that we were in a crisis.",
         "If you go to A7, which is around the underlying earnings, you can see a couple of things. Number one, these \u2013 the underlying earnings of \u20ac1.9 billion for the half year of 2020 is very much in line with what we have already communicated on the 3rd of June, which was the \u20ac1.5 billion COVID claims. And so if you take out COVID-19 and AXA Equitable, which we don\u2019t have anymore, you come to a reduction of 48% relative to last year. However, when you take away the COVID claims, we can clearly see that there is a progression of plus 1% underlying earnings, which demonstrate again the resilience of AXA Group in a very adverse financial environment.",
         "If you go one slide further to Slide A8, you see the repetition by geography. First, is clearly the fact that most of our geographies and most of our businesses are very resilient because when you look at last year versus 2020, including COVID, you see that most geographies, France, Europe, Asia and International are exactly at the same level as they were last year. So the negative COVID effects and the positive COVID effects, mainly from a lower frequency in Motor and higher growth in Health have really compensated one each other and shown high resilience.",
         "Obviously, we have also reacted very swiftly to the crisis with a very disciplined management of general expenses and keeping the investment margin stable. I said earlier, COVID-19 is essentially hitting the commercial business, and therefore, you see that the main impact for AXA is at AXA XL because AXA XL is predominantly a commercial business and has no opportunity to diversify either way with businesses that are benefiting from the COVID-19 crisis.",
         "When you look at AXA XL as a zoom because we have certainly changed the CEO this year, you can see that the underlying trend is very positive. Very positive, why? Because ex-COVID, we would have been at plus 9% of revenue growth. This is certainly due to the fact that Scott Gunter and his team is very focused on a very disciplined underwriting. And secondly, the underlying earnings ex-COVID would have been \u20ac0.5 billion. And if you then were to exclude the \u20ac100 million that we had to pay for civil unrest, you would be at \u20ac0.6 billion, which is very much in line with the \u20ac1.2 billion that we have aimed for before COVID has arisen for the whole year.",
         "What is very reinsuring about AXA XL is that the pricing actions and the pricing trends are continuing. So in the insurance sector, you still got, despite the crisis, plus 14% price increase. And if you dig a little deeper, for example, into the U.S. business, the price increases are around 23%. And when you even go further into the lines of business, that have, for example, experienced social inflation, you see that the price increases in Excess Casualty, for example, are at plus 80% for this year.",
         "On the reinsurance side, you finally also see more decent price increases at 7.5%. Scott and his team have been very fast in putting in a new organization that is simpler, that is more accountable, and that is really focused on underwriting discipline. And when you look at the dynamic between top line development and claims inflation, you clearly see that top line is growing more than claims inflation is growing, which is the ultimate test of a healthy insurance business.",
         "At the same time, we have continued with the underwriting actions that we have already announced at the beginning of the year, reducing our property cat exposure. We have dropped \u2013 the revenue has dropped by 11%. This is a reaction of a reduced exposure despite the fact that we could achieve 10% price increase. And when you look at the line sizing in casualty, we have really gone through the portfolio and reduced the maximum risk limits from \u20ac50 million per risk to \u20ac25 million per risk. So I\u2019m very pleased with the transformation at XL. We are still in the hardening cycle, and AXA XL should, after COVID, really show the fruit of this transformation.",
         "When you go to Slide A10, you will see the effects on the balance sheet. The balance sheet is remaining very strong and resilient. The Solvency II ratio is at 180% with the expected upside that I mentioned earlier, one upside coming from the further disposals, around six points. The other one coming from the integration of AXA XL into the internal model, between 5% and 10%. Both of these should be happening in the second half of 2020.",
         "Cash remittance remains very strong. As I said, we have upstreamed most of the dividends from the local entities. Cash remittance is at \u20ac4.9 billion. So the company is very solid. There should be no reason to believe that a dividend would not be able to be paid, certainly in the second half. However, as I told you, we do need to respect the recommendation of our regulator that has been very clear and very strong, not to pay any more dividends going forward for the year 2020. This 180% solvency at first year \u2013 at first half 2020 also include the accrued dividend based on the 50% pro rata of the full year 2019 initial proposal of \u20ac1.43.",
         "If I summarize and look forward, AXA Group is well positioned for the future. Given the current market dynamics, we continue to see a hardening pricing cycle in P&C commercial line, as I said earlier, plus 14% in the first half of 2020. Despite the crisis, we see a continuing growth in the profitable Health business. We have benefited from plus 9% on the revenue side and plus 7% growth on the earnings side. The business profile is now well adapted to the low interest rate environment. We shifted dramatically from financial risk to technical risks. Today, 74% of our revenue is in the target segment, P&C, Health & Protection.",
         "We\u2019ve also leveraged the crisis to accelerate on the digital interactions with our customers, making sure that our employees could work and perform customer service very smoothly and very fast during the locked down. And we have clearly stated and continued that we want to keep up the leadership around climate transition despite the time of crisis. We recently published a climate report in which you have seen that AXA is exemplary with having an investment portfolio that only has 2.8 degrees of Celsius warming potential relative to a market average that has 3.6. This is, for us, a clear sign that we want to and should continue this journey on being the leader in the climate transition.",
         "Thank you very much, and we are now moving on to the part of Etienne Bouas-Laurent with our financial performance.",
         "Thank you, Etienne. And before we come to the Q&A session, one last logistical detail on Page A30. As you\u2019ve seen, we have planned an Investor Day for December 1. Originally, we wanted to launch the new plan 2021 to 2023 on that day. But given the fact that COVID-19 has certainly has an impact on the 2020 numbers and we are only in the middle of the year, we have decided to maintain the Investor Day on December 1, focusing on key topics that we have. And then having another Investor Day after the full year results 2020. So sometime after end of February 2021, on which \u2013 in which we launch and present the new plan 2021 to 2024, most likely, just as a logistical detail because I\u2019m sure that question of the new plan will arise.",
         "So after that, let\u2019s move to the Q&A. And as Andrew said, we will give preference to the questions now, in the past, it was in the room, on the phone there. Who wants to start? And it\u2019s always good if you introduced yourself with name and institution, so we know who to speak to."

I just wondered if you could give an indication of where we are? I normally think of it in terms of payback, but I think I\u2019m being a bit optimistic saying it a payback. I think it\u2019s more future profits rather than payback, but maybe you might say that it\u2019s payback a bit. On the operating or organic capital generation, I noticed at the half year, net of dividend, it was zero in the solvency roll forward. And I just wondered if you can kind of say where we are now for the second half, I know that the COVID impacts have not come through in the second half, but I still don\u2019t know what the basic \u2013 base numbers should be.",

He will take that question. Your second question was, if I understood correctly, around the question of the solvency roll forward and what do we expect for the second half of the year. Etienne Bouas-Laurent will take that question. And then the third one is around AXA Life Europe, the non-sale, as you called it, do we achieve similar effects to the \u20ac1 billion with the indicated reinsurance structure.

Yes, in terms of the rates we\u2019re achieving, we believe we are getting rates that are running ahead of loss trend for most of our products that we look at. Now we are in \u2013 obviously, after many years of a soft market, come through the late teen \u2013 early mid-teens of the 2020 sort of 2014 through 2019 coming through that soft market period, where there were \u2013 rates were not keeping up with social inflation, claims inflation. We have \u2013 obviously, the industry has a deficit to still build through on the rates. So we are continuing to push that pricing. But right now, today, when we look at the pricing relative to claims inflation, we believe that we are getting rates in excess of loss inflation, but we still have ways to go. So we expect that to continue at least through the back half of this year and into next year. Thank you, Thomas."

You rightly say that COVID should not reiterate in the second half. However, given the operating return, would be giving a guidance on our earnings, which is difficult for us to give. First, because we never give guidance. And second, because we are in a very volatile environment, and we must remain very vigilant and cautious. However, you have noted the positive impacts related to the sale of the two businesses, which is running well, which brings six points. You have as well the internal model of XL from 5 to 10.

So I think at the full year, you talked about the reserves at XL is being adequate or so the group reserves are in good shape. And there\u2019s another reserve hedge at XL. So in terms of the solo balance sheet of XL, to what extent do you have the flexibility to grow exposure in XL, if that\u2019s the choice?",

If you look at the first quarter, the 19 points of negative market movements, is there anything that structurally happened with the balance sheet in terms of hedging, et cetera, that suggest that wouldn\u2019t come back if markets were to normalize?

Alban de Mailly Nesle, Chief Risk Officer, who\u2019s with us should answer that question around the negative \u2013 of the negative market movement of the 19 points and the question around hedging.

One, we are diligent on working on improving the quality of the existing portfolio, whether that\u2019s through underwriting actions, careful analysis of the business, pricing and where we can get \u2013 if we can get the rate we think we need, we definitely want to grow it. So there are parts of the business that we feel are performing not pretty well \u2013 that are performing pretty well that we think can grow.",

So we like to believe we can actually do both at the same time. Although it\u2019s a challenge for every insurance carrier is to figure out where are you getting paid adequately and then you apply the resources to that business.

So the short answer is, yes, we would get them back to the extent the markets normalize together between interest rates and spreads. The \u2013 if we get one and not the other, then you have the sensitivities that you have on this slide, where corporate spreads, for instance, have increased by 50 bps at zero point because that\u2019s the current interest rate level that have some impact on it.

Firstly, just on the Q4 dividend, which is not now being paid, should we just assume that cash is absorbed within AXA or just obviously that as deferred cash, at some point, can come back to the shareholders.",
            "Second point was just on the \u20ac1.5 billion of COVID claims, just wondered if you could tell us a little bit more about how that breaks down into what\u2019s already reported, what\u2019s incurred but not yet reported and what\u2019s to play for future claims that you expect to be incurred as a result of COVID?",

Can you give us some color on discussions you\u2019ve had with your reinsurers to get comfort on the net figure, and I didn\u2019t see your usual slide on XL\u2019s reinsurance program. Just really wondered if there\u2019s any protection from the aggregate cover \u2013 COVID even to protect you, say, into H2."

            "Thank you, Andy, for the questions. So the number one was on the Q4 and the dividend is the cash absorbed? Can it come back? Etienne, if you could answer that question. Second one was on the COVID claims, \u20ac1.5 billion, what is incurred, what is not incurred yet. I\u2019ll talk about this. And then the third one is around the discussion with the reinsurers and the XL reinsurance program. Alban, if you could take that question. I will go straight to the second one and pass it on to Etienne.",
            "So the \u20ac1.5 billion COVID claims is exactly the same number that we had already published on the 3rd of June. When you look where do these COVID claims come from, it comes mainly from business interruptions, from event cancellations, from D&O liability and travel and some solidarity measures offset by positive news on motor frequency. Many of these items can be \u2013 have been observed. If you look, for example, at the event cancellations, you know exactly which events have been organized, which have been insured, which have been canceled or deferred. So these numbers are relatively clear. We see that many of the claims are incurred, not all of them are reported. But on this one, you have a very clear indication.",
            "On the business interruption, it\u2019s the same. And you\u2019ve also seen some of these being in the media, where people have claimed on the claims. And because that is also a component of cash management for these entrepreneurs, they have an interest to claim relatively quickly. So on this one, we know more or less what\u2019s happening. Going forward, this has to be seen how it evolves because some of the claims are still subject to litigations when it comes to the business interruptions. Others have still the question around how, for example, does the motor frequency evolve. We\u2019ve seen during the confinement that it has been reduced, but now people would prefer to take their own car.",
            "So if you look at all of this, the \u20ac1.5 billion is our best estimate as of today. It has stayed stable, and we hope that it will stay stable. Your question around IBNR versus already happened. So 65% at XL, for example, on the business interruption is incurred but not reported. So we know also from the past what to do there. And the same is obviously true at the D&O and liability, where you have claims that still follow. There is also roughly 65% incurred but not reported.",

            "The second point is that any kind of decision related to the dividend belongs to the Board, which will take place in February 2021. It\u2019s up to them to decide. So it\u2019s extremely difficult. And to give any kind of guidance on this, we have to be patient and wait for it. I just remind you once again that we have accrued for 50% of the \u20ac1.43 at half year, which means that we should accrue for \u2013 the final accrual will be dependent upon the decision of the board. But you noticed that by doing that, with this methodology, we are accruing for something which is above the classical payout ratio of 50% to 60%. And I will stop here."

         "Remarks": [
            "So our reinsurance program, as you know, includes several components. I mentioned three, and I\u2019ll start with the two easiest ones. You have a per risk component on all lines of business, property, event cancellation and so on, and that\u2019s reasonably mechanical. The second one is what \u2013 one that you mentioned, which is the aggregate. That covers insurance and reinsurance, but on a named peril only. And pandemic was not part of those named perils, and therefore, the aggregate would not come into play.",
            "And then there is the third component, which is the insurance per event. That covers our property cat portfolio on the insurance side. So that\u2019s where, in particular, you will have the business interruption claims that would be launched with the reinsurers. So the discussion has started with the reinsurers on that one. It\u2019s a very open discussion, but it\u2019s obviously a complex, and it\u2019s going to be a long discussion, given the size of the event, given the fact that it\u2019s on many geographies that act differently, and that\u2019s obviously still an ongoing issue."

Perhaps you could just update us where we are with that and whether you still intend to do that in the second half of the year. Also, it seems like you\u2019ve issued \u20ac1.1 billion of commercial paper in the period. Can you just outline why you did that?",

I presume there was no dividend paid out of XL Bermuda. When we look out to Q1, are you expecting to take a dividend out of XL Bermuda? I think the local Solvency level was around 150%. And obviously, you\u2019re looking to grow quite strongly there. So it may be that you don\u2019t do that next year. Just any help about the outlook for remittances would be helpful.",

And then the third one on the debt gearing, I will answer to that, are we in a good range, yes or no. So Etienne, if you could start with the first two."

It will happen in the second part of the year. I remind you as well that we might expect some further cash remittance, but we don\u2019t give any guidance on this.

We tested \u2013 we regularly test the market in these turbulent times to see what\u2019s the liquidity. So there is no specific target on the commercial paper. It\u2019s \u2013 the maturity ranges between three months and 12 months. So it\u2019s for us just a way to test the market. There is no specific message around that. It can be up and down. It was zero at the beginning of the year. It has gone up a little bit in the first half. There is no intention to go further up. In the second part, maybe we\u2019ll reduce part of it because it will come to maturity. But I would not focus to give too much attention to this. So we are pretty comfortable with the liquidity. We don\u2019t change fundamentally what we said at the end of February on this front. So \u2013 and regarding your question on XL, sorry, James, I\u2019m not sure I got it precisely."

You didn\u2019t take a dividend out of Italy. You didn\u2019t take one out France Life. I don\u2019t think you took one out of XL last year. So just looking forward to Q1, XL\u2019s Bermuda capitalization, I think, was 158% at the end of 2019, and you\u2019ve got strong growth coming expected in there. So what should we expect for remittances from some of these areas, XL Bermuda included into Q1? Because for me, the liquidity looks tight, and particularly in the context of a dividend that costs \u20ac3.5 billion when it gets more difficult to upstream cash from some of the local units in this environment?"

That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always been in and what we\u2019ve also already announced, being between 25% to 28% is a good range and going back to the definition of the debt gearing. On the contrary, we have a rather conservative definition of the debt gearing. Because as opposed to other larger insurance group, we do not include the OCI into the denominator of this number. Therefore, it is much more conservative with regards to others.",

And for example, substitute all debt, which obviously had a cost that was much higher than it is today with newer subdebt that has much better conditions. You were then also referring to goodwill and in particular, I guess, to the goodwill of XL. We\u2019ve seen that COVID is clearly an exceptional event that there is no change to our long-term view of XL because as we pointed out earlier, the underlying performance of the XL business ex-COVID is very much in line with our expectation. I remind you the underlying earnings ex-COVID are plus 1% relative to last year at \u20ac0.5 billion. And as Scott pointed out earlier, the pricing outlook for commercial lines remains despite the crisis very favorable.",

And we gave already some sensitivities on these topics in the previous IR days. And of course, what I can \u2013 so this doesn\u2019t change fundamentally when you look at our numbers, but of course, the lower level of interest rates, the higher the acceleration of the decrease on the investment margin.

Their revenues and their businesses are more impacted than others. So we balance that all out when we look at our business. But if you look at the sort of the four buckets you mentioned, from a reinsurance standpoint, obviously, with the way the direction of the cat pricing is going, we think there\u2019s an opportunity, particularly the trend on the cat business to continue to grow that business as well as casualty on the reinsurance side.",

We believe there\u2019s an opportunity to pick and choose your spots and grow in that business. In Europe, we\u2019re looking at both property and casualty as opportunity. Specialty business, there\u2019s challenges in the marine portfolio. We probably won\u2019t grow that one quite as much, but we look at our ARC\u2019s BT business and our crisis management business as both growth opportunities for us going forward. So we take a careful look at each of these portfolios every year, go through and figure out which ones have the opportunity to grow. We may \u2013 the overall may not necessarily grow due to the impact on exposure, but we may grow in-force count in the lines as we look at them."

One definitely is health as we have observed a lower consumption of usual health care during the lockdown period. And for France, for example, it\u2019s up to \u20ac60 million. And we also observed lower claims frequencies on motor, mainly, but also on non-motor in retail and in commercial. And for France, it has an impact, for example, by \u20ac150 million before tax. And so \u2013 and we don\u2019t know exactly if we will continue on the same trend on this on this field because we observe that the frequency in motor, for example, is progressively moving to normal. And concerning half, we can consider also that our clients will try to go back to normal life and visiting their doctors as often as they used to do."

            "Thank you, Jacques. If we look on the growth prospects on the second half, I think the month of July probably gives a good indication. What we see is that health is remaining strong. And I do believe that this will continue since we have a much higher awareness around health and certainly also in more developing and emerging markets, where health is still at a low level, Etienne earlier mentioned China, we will see strong growth.",
            "On the P&C side, we have also turned again into positive territory. And certainly, when we listen to what Scott is saying around the price increases, we will also expect a return back into a positive territory. However, we also see that some lines of business are very much linked in their revenue to economic activity. So if you take, for example, aviation or marine, this is very much a premium growth is linked to how many shipments have been done, how many flights have been performed. And since we know that certainly on the flight side, we probably have less flights, this needs to be taken in consideration.",
            "On the Life business, I do probably expect the biggest, let\u2019s say, heavyweight when it comes to the revenue. Life remains down in July with similar structures that we\u2019ve seen beforehand. So general account is suffering, whereas protection and unit-linked progresses well. This is very much related also to the uncertainty of people not knowing what is going to happen and rather taking a wait-and-see approach when it comes to investing larger sums. So this is roughly the picture going forward when it comes to growth.",

That would be the first one.",

On the exposure, as you can imagine, this event happened a couple of days ago, and it\u2019s far too early to say anything. We are working together with the team of Scott and Alban now through the exposures. And when we have a better situation, we will be able to give a better update. Jacques, on health in France."

And the main part of this new load will take place in 2021, and we plan to take that into account in our renewal policy in order to face this extra load we will have to register."

I just want to understand a bit more about how to think about XL earnings for coming years. I mean if I look at your guidance, about \u20ac1.2 billion, how do we think about three moving parts here?",
            "First of all, what you\u2019re suggesting is pricing is moving ahead of claims inflation. So I think that\u2019s a positive. But then at the same time, it feels like falling interest rates, especially in U.S., I mean, we have seen a sharp decline in interest rate, that should have an impact on your investment income in the XL business and investment income in XL in material. And at the same time, there is an adverse currency move we have seen over the past three months. I mean that could be another big impact on the XL earnings. So how should we think about that \u20ac1.2 billion guidance? I mean would this pricing be able to offset these two negatives? Is it more? Is it less? Any thoughts on that would be really helpful.",
            "The second question would be around this disposal process and the couple of businesses that you are looking to dispose and \u2013 as well as XL internal model integration. So can you give us some additional insight into that because I mean getting about 13 points of extra capital would be helpful, especially in the current volatile environment? So how \u2013 what is the degree of confidence that you have that these two things will be done? And the last one would be, I mean, I\u2019m not sure if we can get some clarity on this, but any thoughts on like your reinsurance agreements, the assumption that you are using in COVID-19-related claims, the gross that is netted out, what could be the potential ranges of positive or negative if things don\u2019t go as per plan?"

So when we look at our pricing needs, what we need to achieve, we include the impact of declining interest rates in our calculation to determine, yes, how much more rate do we need to offset the declining interest rate investment income place. So we worked hard to balance that both out. So we would anticipate that as we work through our pricing, we\u2019ll include any anticipated interest rate or investment income into our required need on the underwriting side. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily be changing anything based on the investment income, if we can recover more on the pricing side. Thomas?"

And on the Belgium side, there were also questions raised from the European Union or the Central Bank and which are being solved.

And the second one is on the technical margin in Life. I really \u2013 I was confused. Is it \u2013 is what you\u2019re saying that the mortality is next to cost?

            "So I will start with the second one, which is more straightforward. No, we didn\u2019t say that mortality was at stake. We referred to three elements, which were disconnected from the mortality. One was the interest rates, and therefore, the annuities, you have to reinforce your reserve when you \u2013 when your interest rates decrease, it\u2019s pretty mechanical. And the other ones were not related to mortality. So I don\u2019t know if I understood well your question on this, Michael. But there is no deterioration in mortality at a group level, mortality assumptions or mortality experience.",
            "And when we speak about extended disability, it\u2019s easier to explain that in French, for us, it\u2019s [Foreign Language]. It\u2019s daily indemnities for during the confinement, what happened is that some people didn\u2019t go to the doctors. Normally, when you want \u2013 when you have a health reason not to go to work, you have to go to the doctor. There is a process. And then we cover that. During the confinement, we said, no need to go to the doctor, if you don\u2019t feel well, we reimburse anyway. So this has pretty high cost. So this is a very temporary measure related to the daily health, short-term health issues, absolutely not to mortality. Maybe the misunderstanding comes from this point.",
            "Related to the earnings per share, it\u2019s a tricky question because if you start giving EPS target, including or excluding some elements, it\u2019s getting very tricky. And raising also the question of what is COVID related, what is not COVID related, could be something a bit tricky. And so this is one point. And the second one is that giving the six months guidance is not something we do. We never did that. We never do that on a 12-month basis. On a six months basis, it\u2019s even more tricky. And given the \u2013 as you just rightly said, given the very high uncertainties in H2, where you see that nobody on the market is giving any kind of guidance, I think that it will not be a good idea to say, at AXA, we know what\u2019s going to happen contrary to the rest of the world. So let\u2019s remain modest with that and let\u2019s remain very vigilant."

You have \u20ac0.1 billion positive coming from France and Europe. Is that the full extent of the kind of prudence in reserves from the frequency, which you may have not booked in the first half? That seems to be what your peers have done, but the number seems low.

And the 50% was, I think the fact that we paid early enough this dividend was right decision, given what is happening on the regulatory side.
