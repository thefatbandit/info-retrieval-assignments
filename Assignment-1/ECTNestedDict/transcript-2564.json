         "Thank you, Katherine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Lincoln Electric's 2020 Second Quarter Conference Call. We released our financial results earlier today, and you can find our release as an attachment to this call's slide presentation, as well as on the Lincoln Electric website, at lincolnelectric.com in the Investor Relations section.",
         "Joining me on the call today is Chris Mapes, Lincoln's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, as well as Gabe Bruno, our Chief Financial Officer. Chris will begin the discussion with an overview of our second quarter results and our cost reduction initiatives and Gabe will cover our second quarter financial performance in more detail. Following our prepared remarks, we are happy to take your questions.",
         "Before we start our discussion, please note that certain statements made during this call may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of risk factors. A discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our results are provided in our press release and in our SEC filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. In addition, we discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is found in the financials tables in our earnings release, which, again, is available in the Investor Relations section of our website, at lincolnelectric.com.",
         "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris Mapes. "

         "Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release issued earlier today, we continue to successfully operate as an essential infrastructure sector business due to the dedication of all of our global employees. So, first and foremost, thank you for your perseverance and commitment to operating safely. ",
         "Our retail teams are now highly adept at operating productively with heightened safety protocols and our customers are engaged with us on product webinars are experiencing high service levels and are seeing continued innovation with the launch of six new products in the quarter. We are also focused on long-term initiatives that advance our 2025 higher standard strategy goals. ",
         "Our higher inventory build and new product investments will allow us to capitalize on the next growth cycle. Our work on enterprise initiatives that leverage shared services and to further standardize processes and systems will also generate long-term value and differentiation in our business. ",
         "Moving to Slide 4, and an overview of our second quarter financial results, we successfully navigated what we believe was the economic trough of COVID-19. Despite second quarter organic sales declines of 24.8%, we achieved solid profitability, strong returns and cash generation. Our focused execution of cost reduction initiatives generated $27 million in savings, which exceeded our plan and contributed to an adjusted operating profit margin of 10.7% and a 23% detrimental margin. ",
         "Adjusted earnings per share decreased 37.5.5% to $0.80, and returns on invested capital remains solid at 18.6%. Cash flow generation improved sequentially to $104 million in the second quarter with a 189% free cash flow conversion. ",
         "We returned approximately $29 million to shareholders through our 4% higher dividend payout rate, and continued to invest in internal capital programs focused on growth and operational efficiency. ",
         "We continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and increased available liquidity by reducing short-term debt. Our capital allocation strategy positions us well to successfully navigate the conditions ahead and generate value for all of our stakeholders. ",
         "Moving to Slide 5. We experienced broad regional end-market declines as industrial activities slowed due to customer shutdowns and project deferrals. Demand troughed in April and improved sequentially in May and June across all segments as activity resumed. In Asia-Pacific and in our Harris Products Group segment, June organic sales were positive. ",
         "By in sector, Automotive and Heavy Industries remain the most challenged, while general Fabrication and Energy compressed at low-teens percent and Infrastructure Construction was relatively steady versus prior year. ",
         "Looking at product demand trends, our consumables and standard equipment systems compressed at a comparable rate to our consolidated organic sales results. Given commercial success of new solutions, our equipment sales have been more resilient than in prior downturns. Our Automation Solutions remained challenged at mid-teens rates. ",
         "July month-to-date orders have continued to improve at a slower rate are trending down high-teens to low-20%. The Harris segment\u2019s July order rates have remained relatively steady with the prior year, while early in the quarter, we remained cautious due to different regional recovery rates and risks of secondary shutdowns. ",
         "Turning to Slide 6. Our team did an outstanding job curtailing cost in the second quarter. We achieved $27 million in savings which substantially exceeded our plan and was largely driven by an outperformance of temporary cost savings such as lower discretionary spending, and reduced work hours. ",
         "Given ongoing macro uncertainties and limited visibility due to COVID-19, we are maintaining diligent cost control measures. We have increased our 2020 cost savings targets due to the accelerated pace of temporary cost savings year-to-date and an increase in permanent cost savings in Americas Welding. We now expect to recognize $55 million to $65 million of savings in 2020. ",
         "This range compares with our first quarter estimate of $40 million to $45 million. Approximately, 35% of the consolidated benefits will be permanent. We expect to exit 2020 at $8 million to $9 million in permanent cost savings in the fourth quarter. We anticipate temporary cost savings to moderate in the third quarter as markets slowly recover and our organization resumes some spending to support growth. ",
         "Looking ahead, I am confident that our organization will continue to operate safely, prioritize our customers\u2019 needs and maximize cost savings to align the business to demand. Our disciplined execution of our Higher Standard 2025 strategy, and improved use of the cash will deliver superior results for our stakeholders long-term. ",
         "And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gabe to review second quarter financials in more detail. "
      ],
      "Gabe Bruno": [
         "Thank you, Chris. Moving to Slide 7, our consolidated second quarter sales decline 24%, as a 2% benefit from acquisitions was offset by 24.5% lower volumes, 30 basis points of lower price, and a 1.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Our gross profit margin decreased 260 basis points to 32.1%, as benefits from cost reduction actions and price management were offset by the unfavorable impact of lower volumes. ",
         "Our SG&A expense declined 22.7% or $37 million reflecting savings from our cost reduction actions and $13 million in lower incentive compensation. SG&A as a percent of sales increased 40 basis points to 21.4%. We expect the decline in year-over-year incentive compensation will narrow in the second half of 2020. ",
         "Reported operating income decreased 62.2% to $39.8 million, or 6.7% of sales. Operating income results included $23.2 million of rationalization and asset impairment charges. Substantially, all of these charges were non-cash charges in Americas Welding and include a $3.3 million pension settlement charge also in the Americas segment. ",
         "Excluding special items, adjusted operating income decline 40.5% to $63 million or 10.7% of sales, a 290 basis point decline versus the prior year. Adjusted operating income benefited from $27 million in cost savings, lower wage and incentive compensation expenses. Our detrimental adjusted income margin was 23% in the quarter. ",
         "Our second quarter effective tax rate was 19.8%, compared with 17.4% in the prior year period. Excluding special item charges, our second quarter tax rate was 20.3% due to the mix of earnings and discrete items. This compares with 22% in the prior year period. We our 2020 effective tax rate to be in the low to mid 20% range subject to the mix of earnings and anticipated expense of discrete tax items. ",
         "Second quarter diluted earnings per share decreased 66.9% to $0.45, compared with a $1.36 in the prior year. Excluding $0.35 of EPS from special items, adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 37.5% to $0.80. ",
         "Now moving to the geographical segments on Slide 8, Americas Welding segment second quarter adjusted EBIT dollars declined 45% to $46.7 million. The adjusted EBIT margin declined 370 basis points to 12.9% as benefits from cost reduction activities, lower discretionary spending and lower incentive compensation expense were offset by the impact of lower volumes. ",
         "Looking at the top-line, Americas Welding reported a 29.5% decline in organic sales primarily from comparable declines in Consumables and in our Standard Equipment offering. Automation remained challenged from lower capital spending in Automotive and Heavy Industries. The segment\u2019s 30 basis point decline in price primarily reflects the impact of the removal of U.S. tariff surcharges which anniversaried in late Q2. ",
         "Moving to Slide 9. The international Welding segment\u2019s adjusted EBIT decreased 36.2% to $9.7 million and the adjusted EBIT margin declined 170 basis points to 5.3%. Benefits from cost reduction activities, lower discretionary spending, and a net $2.5 million benefit from public paid leave programs help mitigate the impact of lower volumes. ",
         "Organic sales decreased 21.5%, primarily from lower volumes in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia Pacific. We achieved an increase in organic sales in China following a strong second quarter rebound. ",
         "Moving to the Harris Products Group on Slide 10. Second quarter adjusted EBIT decreased 13.2% to $11.7 million. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased 70 basis points to 14.3% versus a record 15% in the prior year period. Cost reduction actions and operational efficiencies drove solid margin performance. Harris reported a 7.8% decline in volumes, as growth in the retail channel was offset by industrial sector weakness. ",
         "Moving to Slide 11. We generated $104 million in cash flow from operations in a 189% cash conversion ratio from higher free cash flow versus the prior year. Working capital increased on higher inventory levels as we have strategically been building inventory to support the recovery. We expect our working capital ratio to improve sequentially in the second half of the year. ",
         "We strengthened our liquidity position and maintained a strong balance sheet profile in the second quarter. As highlighted on Slide 12, we have an investment-grade profile balance sheet with no near-term debt maturities. We reduced our short-term debt by $83 million in the quarter increasing liquidity to $545 million. ",
         "Our strong cash flow generation and lower use of working capital in the second half of the year will deliver continued strong cash conversion performance. ",
         "Moving to Slide 13. We are prudently maintaining our capital allocation strategy. We deployed $45 million in the quarter across internal investments and the return of cash to shareholders through our dividend program. We repurchased 3.2 million of shares at an average share price of $70.25. ",
         "We continue to estimate full year capital spending to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million as we prioritize growth and cost-efficiency projects at this point of the cycle. We are continuing to evaluate M&A opportunities and expect to resume share buyback activity once business conditions have further improved. ",
         "As you look ahead to the third quarter, while the shape of the recovery remains uncertain, we are confident in our commercial and operational initiatives and the strength of our business model. Continued strong cash flow generation, increased liquidity and conservative disciplined management of the balance sheet enable us to continue to navigate this challenging environment, while delivering solid returns to our shareholders. ",
         "With that, I would like to turn the call over for questions. "

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, Joe, we\u2019ve seen a nice progression down from that trough in April that we believe is the trough of what we\u2019ll see from the pandemic and the recession that\u2019s \u2013 it looks like it\u2019s coming from the pandemic. Obviously, that rate has slowed as we are exiting June and moving into July. But we are still seeing improvements in that and as we stated, some positive areas around the world, positive with the Harris business, almost at prior year, as well as China performing well. ",
            "And I would say, our U.S. businesses, our Americas businesses are slightly behind that pacing that we are seeing in our international businesses. But we really look at that and view that as just the migration of the impact of COVID across that business and again. ",
            "It\u2019s also seeing a rate of improvement. I just think that we are going to continue to be challenged by seeing a gradual improvement as we are moving through the rest of this year and into 2021. "

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. And then, can you expand on the cost savings a little bit? I think, back toward the end of April, you were talking about second quarter cost savings that would approximate the $7 million that you did in the first quarter and then in third it comes in at $27 million. ",
            "So, can you bridge that at all and can you talk about how those savings evolved over the course of the quarter in terms of what you are able to identify actions you\u2019re able to take?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Joe O'Dea "
      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, Joe. So to speak about our communications and back in April, you are right, we\u2019re at that range of $40 million to $45 million in total savings and 45% of that was permanent, that\u2019s what we\u2019re tracking. We are still in that same range and we talked about permanent savings of 35%. But it\u2019s in that $20 million to $22 million range. ",
            "The key difference there though is that, a bit of shifting between what we expected on the international side with a little bit more to delay and just working through the dynamics in the international regions versus the Americas and you saw some of the actions we\u2019ve taken in the second quarter on the Americas side. ",
            "But the big change is really the temporary dynamic and we did see progressively the impact of all the discretionary spending coming more quickly as we progressed the quarter. And so, that\u2019s where we ended that $27 million and so, of which $22 million of that would be temporary. ",
            "Now going forward, we do expect temporary savings to decline and I would expect temporary savings to decline in half, let\u2019s say in Q3 and then a half again in Q4. So, that progression that we saw is going to be tampered as we progress throughout the year in our business reengages. ",
            "I do see the permanent side to begin to increase in the third quarter and then as we exit the fourth quarter to have permanent structural savings in the $8 million to $9 million range per quarter as we exit the year. "

      },
      "12": {

So we have the temporary savings trajectory coming to almost a breakeven by the end of the year. "

That will then I assume translate into your detrimental segment level were really, really good this quarter at about 23%. We should assume that those are going to come in at a high of detrimental in the third quarter as the temporary costs fall off and the permanent costs ramp up. "

         "Speaker": "Nathan Jones "

      "19": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So, Nathan, I would just assume that our detrimentals follow the range of what we saw in Q2 and think about the projection of the trajectory of savings dropping into that $10 million to $15 million range per quarter, of which the mix begins to evolve to more of a permanent structure as of outlined. Now the other thing to think about, Nathan, is we have disclosed the incentive comp reduction in Q2 being $13 million year-over-year. ",
            "And if you recall last year\u2019s third quarter and fourth quarter, we had significant adjustments in incentive comp. And so, I would expect in the third quarter, based on what we are seeing now that change progressively is less than half of what we saw in the second quarter and about even in the fourth quarter. ",
            "So, we\u2019ll have a dynamic of how incentive compensation plays out into our detrimentals as well. But using a range of detrimentals that\u2019s similar to what we saw in the second quarter is fair. "

You talked about wanting to carry some more inventory to take advantage of growth opportunities as we come out of the recession here. You also talked about your working capital level in the second half coming down a bit. ",
            "Maybe you could just talk about what kinds of opportunities you see out there if you are prepared and ready with inventory where you can take the market share there and how that plays off with the comment that you expect working capital to come down in the second half? "

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, Nathan, when we were entering the pandemic back in mid-January, early February, we were seeing this start to permeate across our operations around the world. We just sat down as a leadership team and recognized that with our balance sheet strength and our financial profile that we were going to assume that if we had our employees available and we have the raw materials that we were going to make our high running products and place them into inventory. ",
            "The uncertainty associated with whether facilities would be able to operate or the resiliency of the supply chains were just too opaque at that time and we felt that was the best decision for our business and our customers longer-term. And quite frankly, I am very glad that we made those decisions. Now that we sit here today as we are entering into the third quarter, those supply chains have been stressed. ",
            "As I mentioned in my opening comments, we got more confidence in our ability to be able to operate our facilities effectively with the appropriate protocols that are required to keep our employees safe. So, now, we believe we can bring down some of those inventory levels and still obviously meet, if not exceed all of the customer expectations that we have around the world from a demand perspective as some of those start to continue to make improvements in their business. ",
            "So, we\u2019ve talked to our operating teams globally about slowly starting to address some of that inventory build that we\u2019ve put in place to ensure that we\u2019d be able to service those customers during this cycle. "

So, we had \u2013 exports had progressed nicely in the first quarter and but have come off at there from first quarter trends. So we\u2019re about \u2013 our overall trends were about half the decrease that we saw in the overall business and exports represents about a little over 5% of our overall business. ",
            "So, historically, with a weakening U.S. dollar, we would see some potential leverage opportunity on exports. But it\u2019s really difficult to see on a go-forward basis depending really on the mix of investment in many of the end-markets. ",
            "But we are tracking it and the overall impact on exchange is not significant as you saw in the second quarter, it was a little over 1%. But we are tracking the progression on how exchange rates are impacting our business and we do expect our exports are well positioned for growth. "

I personally believe that we are going to be managing through a gradual recovery into 2021. ",

And then you have the risk associated with, if there was a broader secondary challenge out there in the global economic markets because of the pandemic which we couldn\u2019t see today. ",

I do like the fact that we\u2019ve at least seen some improvement in the energy markets as it relates to crude. WTI now above 40 and it\u2019s going to stabilize above 40, that\u2019s better. Then, where we were in April and although that\u2019s going to be a challenge segment for us, at least they\u2019ve gotten some stability. ",

And I still believe that Automotive will continue to make improvements throughout the year and we\u2019ll begin to see some improvements in those heavy industry segments as we migrate through the rest of 2020. So, I think we are managing towards and through a very gradual recovery that will take us into 2021. "

So that\u2019s a relatively tight supply chain. ",

            "Now, I will tell you that we have to be very cautious, because you'll read in the paper that industries or employers are back up and operating and we are still hearing that some of those facilities may be back up and operating but prior to the COVID or the pandemic, they were operating at two or three shifts and now they're operating at one shift. ",

It's difficult for me to give you a characterization across all customers or all segments, because obviously that's very different depending upon the region, as well as the industry segment that we would be working with. But we are very cautious internally when we have those conversations about, okay, what's that OEM doing? ",
            "How many shifts? What do we really view their consumption level to be at. The positive, Dillon, would be that we are seeing that gradual improvement in the business, favorable trend throughout the quarter in Q2, leading into Q3 where we believe July high-teens, low-20s as it relates to that order pattern and expecting to see that gradual improvement as we move through the rest of 2020."
