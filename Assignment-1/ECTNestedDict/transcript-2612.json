      "Joe Sanderson": [
         "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Sanderson Farms Third Quarter Conference Call. Lampkin Butts and Mike Cockrell are with me this morning. Before discussing the quarter, we want to send our thoughts and prayers to our friends and neighbors in Louisiana and Texas, as they deal with the impact of Hurricane Laura. By all accounts, the hurricane moved onshore as one of the most powerful storms to ever hit the United States. We know firsthand the challenges those in the path of the storm face as they deal with the recovery efforts of the storm, and we will do everything we can to assist in that effort.",
         "The storm moved onshore east of our Texas facilities and west of our Hammond, Louisiana operations. As a result, our assets were spared the brunt of the storm, and all of our facilities are operating normally this morning. We will continue to monitor the track of the storm and adjust our operations as warranted.",
         "We reported net income for our third fiscal quarter of $32.8 million or $1.48 per share. This compares to net income of $53.4 million or $2.41 per share during last year\u2019s third quarter. Net income during last year\u2019s third fiscal quarter reflected the accrual of probable liability for our contribution to our ESOP of $2.7 million before income tax or $0.10 per share net of income tax. There is no ESOP accrual in this quarter\u2019s results.",
         "I will begin this morning\u2019s call with a few general comments before turning the call over to Lampkin and Mike. Before making any further comments, I\u2019ll ask Mike to give the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements.",
         "Thank you, Mike. As I have done in our last two investor calls, I want to start by thanking our employees, our contract producers, our customers, our vendors, the consumers who buy our products and the communities and states in which we operate for their work, dedication, and perseverance during these unprecedented times in which we find ourselves. I am grateful for them, for the health care professionals and first responders on the front lines of this crisis and for everyone working to protect the health and welfare of all of us.",
         "We continue to make the health, safety, and welfare of our employees our top priority as we navigate and manage through this pandemic. As we have previously discussed, we developed and implemented many steps to protect our employees, all using the Centers for Disease Control guidelines and the advice and council of experts in the fields of infectious disease and local and state health authorities. As we learn more about the virus and how to prevent its spread, our policies will continue to evolve.",
         "As during our second fiscal quarter, our results for the third quarter reflect the impact of the extraordinary challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented social and economic impact the virus continues to have in the United States and the actions of state and local governments taken to contain the spread of the virus. The resulting poultry market volatility continues to be best illustrated by the market price for jumbo boneless, skinless breast meat.",
         "In mid-May, the quoted boneless price was $1.58 per pound, and we sold spot lows for well above that. On the day of our second quarter call, that price had moved lower to $1.31 per pound. By mid-June, the quoted price was below $1 per pound, before recovering to $1.19 per pound in mid-August and retreating to $1.01 per pound today. Demand from our largest food service customers continues to fluctuate with the opening and the closing of food service establishments in response to the pandemic.",
         "Weekly orders from our largest food service customers during our third fiscal quarter was as low as 68% of normal and as high as 95% of normal. Average weekly volume ordered during the third fiscal quarter was 83% of normal. We expect demand to be uneven as the country struggles to find a new normal, which will contribute to the continued price volatility for food service products.",
         "Our average sales price per pound of fresh and frozen chicken sold decreased 3% during the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to the same period last year, and was lower by 2.8% through the first nine months of this year compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2019. Sequentially, realized prices were higher by 8.3%. Average realized prices for tray pack products during the quarter were higher by $0.024 per pound compared to last year\u2019s third fiscal quarter and were higher by $0.02 per pound sequentially.",
         "Most of the improvement was attributable to improved mix as our tray pack volumes sold increased 28.5% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter and increased 13.3% compared to our second fiscal quarter of 2020. Demand from our retail grocery store customers remains strong in this current environment.",
         "Export markets were under pressure during the third quarter and remain under pressure today. COVID-related issues and lack of liquidity are creating volatility in all markets and the lack of domestic demand for boneless dark meat from food service customers in the United States is resulting in more than ample supplies of leg quarters for export markets. While demand and pricing for chicken paws to China are holding up well, China has ample supplies of dark meat in freezers and movement is slow.",
         "The newly implemented 100% inspection of all container lines and sanitizing of all products and courts has created bottlenecks in the distribution channels, and political challenges in China remain a concern. Our chicken supply outlook for the balance of this calendar year is consistent with USDA\u2019s estimate of a 2.7% increase in chicken production during calendar year 2020. Through July, the USDA reports that 1.1% more heads were processed compared to a year ago.",
         "Live weights are up 1.6% and total ready-to-cook pounds were up 2.8%. This year has one additional day. If we adjust to a per day basis, head process would be higher by 0.4% and total pounds higher by 2.1%. Total egg sets in the United States were up almost 4% during January and February compared to the year ago period, before COVID-related cuts occurred in March and April. Egg sets returned to 100% of a year ago in late May and have averaged 99% of a year ago for the past six weeks.",
         "The USDA published a highly anticipated supply and demand report for grain on August 12. The market was expecting a big yield, and they got one. The USDA\u2019s estimated 180.4 bushels per acre yield for corn increased estimated production to 15.28 billion bushels of corn. The government estimates U.S. soybean farmers will produce 53.3 bushels per acre yield, which, in fact, will generate 4.43 billion bushel crop for soybeans.",
         "The USDA tried to accommodate the larger crop estimates by raising its estimates of grain used for feed and grain sold in the export market. Even with the increased demand assumptions, the USDA increased the carryout of both grains. Despite the constructive report, late season weather issues, including storms in Iowa and dryness in some areas have caused the grain board to move significantly higher this week.",
         "While we agree these weather concerns and less favorable crop condition reports will likely to cause the USDA to lower yield estimates in the September report. Many believe there August demand estimates for exports and feed use were high and need to be lowered as well. The bottom line, we believe that there will be ample supplies of both corn and soy as we move into fiscal 2021. We have priced none of our grain needs for fiscal 2021.",
         "We have, however, priced our grain needs through September. Based on these purchases and what we could complete purchases for today, we expect our grain cost to be approximately $46.8 million lower this fiscal year than last fiscal year. These lower costs would translate into lower feed cost per pound of chicken process of $0.83 per pound this fiscal year compared to last fiscal year.",
         "We have priced none of our fiscal 2021 needs at this time, but we\u2019ll look for opportunities during the coming harvest to take a position if prices move lower. Looking solely at Chicago Board of Trade prices for grain, we could actually price 2020 needs at Board prices very similar to 2020. Soy meal basis quotes for 2021 delivery are higher than during 2020. Corn basis quotes are currently $0.02 per bushel higher than what we paid for corn basis in 2020. Given current USDA estimates and the health of domestic and worldwide grain balance sheets, we might have an opportunity to be a bit more aggressive pricing our needs as we move into fiscal 2021 than is our normal practice.",
         "At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lampkin for a more detailed discussion of the market and our operations during the quarter."

      "Lampkin Butts": [
         "Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Overall, market prices for poultry products were lower during the quarter when compared to our third quarter last year. Average realized prices for retail chill pack products during our third quarter were higher when compared to our third quarter of 2019 as a result of improved mix. Sequentially, prices were higher by $0.02 per pound. Pricing continues to reflect a strong demand environment for chicken in retail grocery stores.",
         "Market prices for products produced at our big bird plants were significantly lower. Bulk leg quarter prices were down for the quarter compared to last year\u2019s third quarter, decreasing 39.1%, reflecting the export market challenges described by Joe. During June, overall industry exports of broiler meat were up 0.5% in volume compared to the same period of last year, but were lower by 10.9% in price. For the year for June, volume is up just over 5%.",
         "Quoted bulk leg quarter prices averaged $0.243 per pound during our third quarter this year versus $0.398 per pound during last year\u2019s third fiscal quarter. The current quote for Urner Barry frozen bulk leg quarter is $0.20 per pound. Realized prices are lower than Urner Barry quote as frozen leg quarters to Mexico, our largest trading partner, are currently trading for $0.16 to $0.20 per pound FOB.",
         "Quoted market prices for jumbo wings were also lower during our third quarter compared to last year. Jumbo wings averaged $1.54 per pound, down 13.2% from the average of $1.77 per pound during last year\u2019s third quarter. The Urner Barry quote is currently $1.86 per pound. Boneless breast prices were higher during our third quarter, increasing by 3.2% when compared to the third quarter a year ago. This year\u2019s third quarter average Urner Barry price of $1.18 per pound compared to an average of $1.14 per pound during last year\u2019s third quarter.",
         "Today, the Urner Barry quoted market for boneless breast is $1.01 per pound. The overall result of these market price changes was a decrease of $0.023 per pound in our average sales price per pound of poultry products sold when compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. While our overall average sales price for poultry products was lower during the third quarter compared to last year, our feed costs were also lower.",
         "Our average feed cost per pound processed during the third quarter was $0.24 per pound, which is down from $0.255 per pound during last year\u2019s third fiscal quarter. We sold 1.22 billion pounds of poultry during the third quarter, a 6.3% increase from the 1.15 billion pounds sold during last year\u2019s third quarter. We processed 1.23 billion pounds of dressed poultry during the quarter, up 3.5% from the 1.19 billion pounds we processed during last year\u2019s third quarter. This increase reflects additional production at our Tyler, Texas facility, offset by our COVID-related production cuts.",
         "For the first nine months of the year, we sold 3.55 billion pounds of poultry products compared to 3.27 billion pounds for the same period last year, and processed 3.58 billion pounds during this fiscal year compared to 3.33 billion last year. We expect pounds processed during our fourth quarter to be approximately 1.22 billion pounds, down compared to the same quarter last year by 5%. We now expect to process 4.8 billion pounds this year, an increase of approximately 4% compared to 4.6 billion pounds processed during fiscal 2019. We sold 27.9 million pounds of prepared chicken products during the quarter, down from 35.6 million pounds last year. Our average sales price at that facility decreased by 1.7%.",
         "At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike."

      "Mike Cockrell": [
         "Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. This morning\u2019s call will contain forward-looking statements about the business, financial condition, and prospects of the company. The actual performance of the company could differ materially from that indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed this morning with the SEC, and in our press release published this morning. These documents are available on our website at sandersonfarms.com.",
         "You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements we make this morning. Each such statement speaks only as of today, and we might not update or revise our forward-looking statements. External factors affecting our business such as feed grain cost, market prices for poultry meat, the health of the economy and, of course, the COVID-19 pandemic, among others, remain highly uncertain and volatile, and our view today may be very different from our view a few days from now.",
         "As stated in our 10-Q filed this morning, the risks and uncertainties for our business related to the COVID-19 pandemic, include continued or worsening absenteeism rates at our facilities, labor shortages, the possible closure of one or more of our facilities, and inability of our contract producers to manage their flocks, supply chain disruptions for feed grains, further changes in customer orders due to shifting consumer patterns, disruptions in logistics and the disruption \u2013 and the distribution chain for our products, liquidity challenges, and a continuing or worsening decline in global commercial activity among other unfavorable conditions.",
         "Thank you, Lampkin. The net sales for the quarter totaled $956.5 million, and that\u2019s up 1.2% from the $945.2 million during the same quarter last year. The increase was the result of lower average sales prices, offset by higher volume. Our cost of sales during the three months ended July 31 as compared to the same three months during fiscal 2019 increased 5.1%, a result of the increase in pounds of poultry products sold and an increase in non-feed-related costs, offset by lower feed cost per ounce processed. Feed cost in plots processed decreased $0.014 per pound compared to last year\u2019s third quarter.",
         "On the other hand, non-feed-related costs increased $0.0214 per pound or 5.2% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. Of that increase, 28 points was attributable to the $1 per hour wage increase effective June 1 last year; 33 points was attributable to the $0.45 per hour wage increase effective January 1, 2020; 42 points was attributable to the $1 per hour COVID-related attendance bonds; and 30 points was attributable to COVID quarantine pay.",
         "Other non-white \u2013 excuse me, other non-wage COVID-related expenses of $2.4 million or $0.20 per pound were booked as cost of goods sold during the third quarter. And we expect to book a similar amount during the fourth fiscal quarter. The balance of the increase in non-feed-related COGS, includes increases in packaging, fixed cost and ship costs.",
         "SG&A expenses during the third fiscal quarter of 2020 were $50.6 million compared to $52.2 million for the same quarter last year. SG&A expenses during last year\u2019s third quarter, as Joe mentioned, included $2.7 million as an accrual for our ESOP contribution, and we have not made an accrual this year. Year-to-date, legal fees were higher by $2.8 million and administrative salaries are higher by $2.2 million. We\u2019ve also booked $8 million in COVID-related expenses to SG&A this year, and trainee costs are lower by $3.6 million. We booked $4.6 million in COVID-related SG&A during our third quarter, and we expect a similar amount during our fourth fiscal quarter.",
         "Now I\u2019m going to talk for a minute about the company\u2019s effective tax rate for the nine months ended July 31, which was 100.6%. The nine-month period rate reflects a net discrete income tax benefit of approximately $38.1 million related to the net operating loss carryback provisions allowed by the CARES Act that allowed the company to carry back to previous year\u2019s net operating losses to those prior years and recruit taxes paid when the federal income tax rate was 35%.",
         "In addition, the CARES Act will allow the company to carry back any net operating tax loss for fiscal 2020 to prior years. We estimate the total benefit of these two provisions to be $58.2 million, which approximates our year-to-date pretax loss of $57.9 million, thus the 100% effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended July 31.",
         "Excluding the onetime discrete benefit recorded during our second fiscal quarter, our effective tax rate for the current year is still higher than the 21% statutory rate because the CARES Act will allow the company to carry back any net tax operating loss to recover taxes that were previously paid at the 35% rate. Normally, during interim periods, we estimate, as best we can, our annual estimated tax rate and use that rate when calculating the interim period tax provision. Given the significant volatility in poultry markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we\u2019re just unable to reliably estimate our annual income tax effective rate. Therefore, the income tax provision for the third quarter and year-to-date was made using the actual effective rate for those periods.",
         "We spent $166 million on CapEx through the third quarter and we now estimate that our CapEx for the full year will be approximately $225.1 million, which includes $52.7 million for large-scale equipment upgrades and the corresponding building improvements at various processing plants, $15 million on the new Mississippi Hatchery, $11.5 million on rolling stock and $145.9 million for maintenance and other small one-time projects.",
         "Our depreciation and amortization was $115.3 million year-to-date and we expect approximately $156 million for the year. We also declared $21.3 million in dividends through the first three quarters of the year. And as of today, we have approximately $19.8 million in letters of credit outstanding under our $1 billion committed revolver, and we had $95 million in loans outstanding under the revolver.",
         "The company did receive $84 million in CARES Act related tax refunds on July 31, 2020, and on that day, we used those funds to reduce our outstanding revolver balance. Our shareholders\u2019 equity at July 31 was $1.4 billion. Our net debt-to-cap was 2% and our total debt-to-cap was 6.4%.",
         "Before we open up the call for questions, I want to remind everyone that the company will host a virtual Investor Conference on Friday morning, October 16, 2020. Details and logistics will be posted on our Investor Relations page soon. And we will also publish a press release when we get closer to the date with those details. We\u2019ll end the \u2013 we will end that meeting by noon on Friday, and we hope, many of you will join us on that virtual meeting.",

So you\u2019ve had these plants that you have shifted towards more retail tray pack business. As we\u2019re sitting here today, just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about your footprint right now? Like are you considering shifting any further assets to tray pack or just if you could give us your most up-to-date thinking on product mix and where you would like to take that in the next couple of quarters?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Heather, we really, we haven\u2019t made any permanent shifts. We did really begin in when the pandemic began. We did take some inventory, live inventory from our big bird deboning complexes. And because of their proximity to a tray pack plant, we would run that bird at a younger age in a tray pack plant. So, we shifted our mix that way and it was not permanent. We continue to look at whether or not we should maybe take one of our smaller plants to tray pack bird way. We\u2019re still looking into it."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. We might. Remember when we took Hazlehurst and Hammond down to 6.75 pounds, we are looking at that. Probably wouldn\u2019t make sense to do it until after the holidays. Demand probably wanes after Labor Day. So, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to do it before then. But \u2013 and it depends on sales. If our sales continue to grow in tray pack, then we might still do that. And right now, our absentees are getting better. You need all your tray pack plants to have full attendance and good attendance if you\u2019re going to be bringing product in from another plant.",
            "We \u2013 the last couple of months, we\u2019ve had a lot of absentees at all the plants, and that does seem to be improving now. It seems like we\u2019re over the peak. And \u2013 but if you\u2019re going to be switching the plant over and bringing in a lot of product, you need to have good attendance and ample employees, and then you need to be on the upswing in demand. And that won\u2019t happen until after the holidays."

So I would have thought I remembered you guys saying you would shift as much as you could because you didn\u2019t \u2013 you basically were maxed out on tray pack packaging. Am I misremembering or have you been able to figure out a way around that if you were to make this change?"

So we\u2019ll have to put that equipment back in those plants if we\u2019re going to convert a deboning plant to 6.75 pound chickens."

So that\u2019s roughly 5 million head a week that have been reduced. And if you look at pullet placements the last three months, they\u2019re running about \u2013 they\u2019re really running under 100% for the last three months of pullet placements. And it appears to me, there\u2019s no way to know this.

            "Well, I would not fool with egg sets, I would look at chick placements. And the reason I said that is because, and look at the U.S. total, don\u2019t look at the 19 state because right now, there is a big variance in hatchability. And I\u2019ve gotten where I don\u2019t look at USDA because of the hatchability. There is a big gap in hatch. Egg sets and instead of comparing to a year ago, compare them to February of 2020. And I\u2019ll give you \u2013 that will tell you what is going home. And I don\u2019t know what fourth quarter is going to look like, but it looks like to me that some people have made some decisions.",
            "And this reminds me of the summer \u2013 what was the summer 2011, that this is the first tentative reduction. And you all remember what happened in June of 2011, if you don\u2019t, go back and look at it. And then there was another reduction later on and another reduction after that. And this looks like to me that the first reductions happened. And it just happened at a different time, but 2011 would be a good indicator of what\u2019s happening right now."
