         "Thanks, Henry. I'm going to start with an overview of our business and financial model. Then review our financial results for the quarter and wrap up with guidance for Q3 and full year 2020. We are driving a high growth subscription business at scale, and we operate profitably, which allows us to reinvest operating leverage to drive durable long-term growth. In Q2, our organic growth plus adjusted operating margin was 89%. ",
         "Moreover, as many of our software company peers aim to achieve profitability or some target margin in the future for operating leverage, we plan to harvest our operating leverage and reinvest it back into the business, continuing to build out new products, such as recruiting or expand upon our differentiation in AI and machine learning. We will also invest in adding sales capacity to fuel continued growth. We are able to achieve strong, sustainable growth at scale because our platform provides tangible and identifiable value and is significantly differentiated versus the competition based on the quality of our data and insights we are able to provide.",
         "We also operate in a very large and under penetrated addressable market, helping companies of all shapes and sizes achieve top line success. To take advantage of this significant opportunity in front of us, we have built a best-in-class, go-to-market engine driven by consistent internal use of our own platform. Our go-to-market motion drives sub 30-day sales cycles, which we combined with an almost immediate implementation to provide quick time to value for our customers. This has become even more important during times of economic uncertainty. ",
         "To round out why we are excited about our business and financial model, our revenue comes almost entirely from subscriptions, typically one to three years in length, and generally billed annually in advance. Subscription prices are based on features and functionality available, the number of users that can access the system and the amount of data that a customer integrates.",
         "This model aligns our revenue with the value derived by our customers, and also enables our land and expand strategy. For our results, please note that metrics will be discussed on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis unless otherwise noted. Impacting our GAAP results in Q2, we did incur a significant stock-based compensation expense triggered by the IPO and related to grants awarded primarily prior to 2018. There will be ongoing expenses related to these grants through 2022 but at lower levels. As a result, we expect our stock-based compensation expense to come down materially in the coming quarters. ",
         "Other differences between GAAP and adjusted metrics include non-cash items like amortization of acquired intangibles and non-recurring expenses related to the IPO or other historical transactions. GAAP revenue in Q2 was $111 million, up 62% year-over-year. Organic growth based on allocated combined receipts was 40% in the quarter compared to Q2 2019, driven by continued new customer additions and expansions of existing customers.",
         "Customers with more than a $100,000 in ACV increased to over 650 with ACV from those customers growing 60% relative to June, 2019. The difference between GAAP and organic growth is due to the fair value adjustments of acquired unearned revenue that principally impacted the comparative revenue figure in 2019. While we were experiencing some headwinds related to the economic uncertainty resulting from the global pandemic, new sales and net dollar retention performed well in the second quarter. We added a record level of ACV from new customers in Q2 and retention activity improved relative to Q1 and Q2 last year.",
         "Adjusted gross profit in the quarter was $98 million yield in an 89% margin up from 88% in Q2 2019 and up from 87% last quarter. As we shift the operating costs, adjusted sales and marketing expense was $27 million or 24% of revenue up from 22% a year ago. We continue to see compelling returns from our sales and marketing investments with an LTV to CAC above 10 times. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing capacity to drive sustainable growth.",
         "Adjusted R&D expense was $7 million or 7% of revenue in Q2, flat with a year ago. R&D is one component of our investment in innovation, which continues to yield a strong competitive advantage and drives a continued pipeline for new revenue sources. When factoring in all of our investments in innovation across the organization, including those investments in data quality that are reflected in cost of sales, we're spending in the mid-teens as a percentage of revenue.",
         "Finally, adjusted G&A expense was $9 million or 9% of revenue as compared to 7% a year ago, as we've continued to add capacity to better operate as a public company. We ended the quarter with approximately 1,300 employees worldwide up 36% year-over-year. And we continued to add headcount in the quarter. Our focus is on continuing to build a culture of performance and on creating an environment where diversity is not only welcome, but encouraged. Based on the revenue growth and investments in the business, adjusted operating income in Q2 was $55 million yielding a 49% margin, which compares to $41 million and a 52% margin in Q2 2019.",
         "Our philosophy is to maintain annual adjusted operating margins in the mid to high 40s. We delivered at the high end of that range in Q2, as COVID-related cost savings, including reduced spending on travel, facilities and marketing events positively impacted margins in Q2. We anticipate that we will be more in line with our operating margin targets for the second half of the year, particularly given that our cost structure will be fully burdened by public company costs going forward.",
         "Adjusted net income for the quarter was $27 million or $0.07 per share based on 403 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. As I think about the impact of COVID-19 on us, we have experienced headwinds and tailwinds. In Q1, we experienced headwinds as some sales cycles stalled when many business leaders were shocked by the magnitude of change they were experiencing in mid to late March. In Q2, our sales teams adjusted to the new environment and drove improved sales and retention activity relative to Q2 last year and Q1.",
         "We do have clients that have been materially impacted by the pandemic. As stated in the S-1, customers and heavily impacted industries represented less than 4% of ACV. And we are seeing heightened cancellations and reductions in spend from this subset of customers relative to pre-COVID timeframes. ",
         "During the quarter, our average contract duration was relatively unchanged at a little over a year, but we have seen a shift in customers opting to pay quarterly instead of annually, as customers look to optimize their cash flow in light of the economic uncertainty. ",
         "Going forward, we expect that economic uncertainty will continue for the foreseeable future. And while we continue to see some headwinds, we are well positioned to drive growth as our platform is highly differentiated, we deliver high ROI. Our customers can achieve quick time to value and we help our customers find their next customer, which many executives deemed to be their most strategic imperative.",
         "Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $260 million in cash and restricted cash. This includes approximately $170 million of cash added to the balance sheet from net IPO proceeds, less repayments of debt and preferred equity. ",
         "Cash flow from operations was $25 million for the quarter, which included $24 million in interest payments. Unlevered free cash flow was $52 million for the quarter and $107 million year-to-date. ",
         "Our capital expenditures consist primarily of investments for growth and the capitalization of internal development costs. Our capital expenditures were $4 million in Q2 and $8 million year-to-date. With proceeds from the IPO, we were paid the revolver second lien and Series A preferred instrument, as well as an additional $100 million of our first lien term loan. ",
         "As a result, our Q2 LTM net leverage ratio was 2.4 times. Based on the cash flow profile of the business and the deleveraging that we implemented through the IPO, we were upgraded by both of the rating agencies that cover our debt, B to B+ at S&P and B2 of Moody's. ",
         "Before I transition to guidance, let me provide some context on our corporate structure. Our structure can create complexity for investors, and while some are quite familiar with an up fee [ph] structure and the multiple classes of stock and tax receivable agreements that come with it, others are likely to be less familiar. The increased complexity does come with a meaningful benefit to shareholders in that the tax advantages of the pre IPO partnership continue to accrue as we transition to a publicly traded company,",
         "These advantages are shared with the public investors through the tax receivable agreements. As a result, our cash tax payments will be lower and therefore drive increased cash flow.",
         "With that, I'll provide our outlook for the third quarter and full year of 2020. Given the GAAP revenue and allocated combined receipts converge in Q3 of this year, we were issuing guidance on GAAP revenue to simplify comparisons and avoid confusion. We expect GAAP revenue in Q3 to be $116 million to $118 million and adjusted operating income between $53 million and $55 million. This implies 34% organic revenue growth and 46% margin at the midpoint of the range. The non-GAAP net income is expected to be $0.08 to $0.09 per share.",
         "For the full year 2020, GAAP revenue is expected to be between $451 million and $455 million. And adjusted operating income between $213 million and $217 million. This guidance implies 35% organic growth and a 47% margin at the midpoint of the range. For those that are modeling, allocated combined receipts, the year-to-date difference between GAAP revenue and allocated combined receipts was $1.7 million due to the impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue, in total for the year we expect approximately $2 million difference. So naturally we expect full year allocated combined receipts to be higher by that amount.",
         "Non-GAAP net income for the year is expected to be $0.29 to $0.30 per share. And we anticipate unlevered free cash flow to be between $206 million and $210 million. The guidance range provided are based on our current operating results to date and assumptions, including anticipated headwinds from the impact of COVID-19 through at least the end of the year.",
         "To summarize, we are very pleased with the business performance in the second quarter. We continue to deliver value to our customers and are focused on generating sustainable growth and profitability over the long term. We have a large and growing addressable market and we'll continue to invest for future growth. We believe that we are in the early stages of this opportunity and are confident we will continue to build a very large and successful company over time. ",
         "Now, let me turn it over to the operator for questions."

      "Henry Schuck": [
         "Great. Thank you, Jerry, and welcome everyone to ZoomInfo\u2019s second quarter financial results conference call, our first as a publicly-traded company. First, let me acknowledge all of our employees on delivering a great quarter. I'm incredibly proud of our team and it's thanks to their hard work that ZoomInfo \u2013 that ZoomInfo\u2019s leading go-to-market intelligence platform helps more than 16,000 companies worldwide sell in market more effectively and efficiently.",
         "In the middle of a pandemic, our team rallied to launch the first virtual software IPO in history and we capitalized on that excitement and momentum while delivering a great quarter for our shareholders. The outside validation provided by the IPO has increased morale across our team, and it's helped to validate what we've always believed that going to market digitally is more efficient and more effective than the analog motions most companies are still using to find their next customer.",
         "While every company during this pandemic grappled with how to prioritize investments, efficiently finding their next customer is at or near the top of the list forever executives. In the quarter, our team delivered 40% organic growth with 49% adjusted operating margins and $111 million of revenue. Year-to-date, we have delivered more than $100 million in unlevered free cash flow. That growth is driven on top of our customers leveraging our actionable insights and intelligence to drive account-based marketing initiatives, sales development plays, territory mapping, lead and demand generation campaigns, sales pipeline reviews, anonymous visitor tracking, ad retargeting campaigns, audience segmentation, and much, much more. ZoomInfo truly sits at the heart of all go-to-market motions.",
         "In June, our conviction that the ZoomInfo platform is truly best-in-class across a wide spectrum of go-to-market strategies was validated by G2 crowd, a well known reviewer of enterprise software solutions. And G2\u2019s Summer 2020 Grid, ZoomInfo earned 10 number one rankings and market intelligence, marketing account intelligence and enterprise and small business sales intelligence. The G2 awards also highlighted the breadth of our solutions and our ability to impact nearly every aspect of a sales and marketing professionals go-to-market activities as we appeared on 14 different G2 grid reports and were named in five different sections, including buyer intent tools and lead capture.",
         "Just a week after the G2 crowd honors, TrustRadius, a customer voice and insights platform awarded us the number one spot for marketing intelligence software after awarding us the number one spot for sales intelligence software in March. Although we are proud of these awards and the industry recognition we are receiving, we recognize that innovation in our space happens fast, and we are committed to continuing to innovate to maintain our clear market leadership.",
         "To that point, we've continued to invest, innovate and enhance our machine learning and natural language processing algorithms around data collection to improve the accuracy and coverage of the data we provide our customers. These investments in the quarter, meaningfully improved our collection efforts, delivering up to a 4x improvement in data throughput. We've continued to enhance our enterprise offerings by adding our intelligence suite of scoops alerts, company hierarchy and locations, intent and company news through our APIs and our data engineers deliver the ability to match companies by specific site locations and street addresses, and then surface contacts associated to those locations through the front-end of our platform and through our APIs.",
         "And our customers and more customers than ever are taking advantage of the new products and functionalities that we have built and delivered. As an example, between Q1 and Q2 customers using our intent product grew close to 50% while customers of our InboxAI product more than doubled. On top of that, our overall engagement rates are up over 20% across all of our platforms. Without the innovation driven by ZoomInfo, sellers and marketers are blind to their target markets and ideal buyers and are completely reliant on disparate, siloed, and manually updated digital rolodexes to drive the targeting of potential customers and the engagement of decision makers within those targets.",
         "Marketers would be forced to drive demand by sponsoring conferences and live events pointed at a broad set of prospects with no insights into their buying intentions or decision making power. This is not the way companies in 2020 should be going to market. For the past two decades, ZoomInfo has been working to change these legacy go-to-market motions, and the pandemic has helped to accelerate this change and has forced the hand of many slow to evolve organizations into making a choice, digitally transform or disappear.",
         "ZoomInfo provides sellers and market \u2013 and marketers, the data, insights and technologies that enable everything from a simple go-to-market motion at a Pecan exporter in Alabama to the most sophisticated go-to-market planning and execution at multinational corporations like Sodexo and SAP. Our platform enables a new way to sell, one where every sales and marketing professional is just a few clicks away from orchestrating the most targeted and effective outreach possible to clients and prospects. For example, imagine being a few clicks away from segmenting and targeting every manufacturing company in the Pacific Northwest with more than a 100 employees, a 401(k) Plan that renews in October, who uses Microsoft dynamics and Oracle NetSuite and who is currently end market for human capital management software.",
         "And being able to take that incredibly granular audience and instantly orchestrate a sale development campaign and marketing automation campaign or an advertising campaign to the key decision makers in that audience, that level of targeting and go-to-market sophistication would take a team of data scientists, engineers and data collectors years to establish and would only be available to the super enterprise with very deep pockets. Today through the combination of a robust contributory network, a constantly evolving machine learning and AI engine and human researchers, ZoomInfo democratizes that capability to every sales and marketing professional, who needs to hit their number every month, quarter and year.",
         "The old way of going to market without this real-time on-demand data is finished. It's finished in the enterprise. It's finished in SMB. If your idea of going to market was having expensive sales reps wander the hallways of major corporations, looking for the next opportunity or spending millions of dollars on a large event presence with a hope that someone with budget and attention would stumble across you, then this pandemic has compelled you to realize that those methods were not only incredibly sub-optimized, but also now wholly unavailable.",
         "Pandemic or not, we've seen companies continue to raise their hands to this change. On the new business side, during the quarter, we onboarded more new customers and more new customer ACV than ever in our history. We released our new platform 10 months ago, and today it accounts for over 50% of our total ARR. Even in the hardest hit industries, we are seeing demand for our data, insights and technology successfully signing dozens of new customers in the hospitality sector in the quarter, including the largest owner operator of company branded hotels in North America, who opted for ZoomInfo the elite package with intent data across their corporate sales team.",
         "We also brought on Kaeser Compressors, the U.S. arm of a 7,000 employee German-based manufacturer of compressed air products and services. With in-person meetings and events not possible for the foreseeable future, Kaeser moved to digitize their go-to-market efforts and continue to develop their funnel. They brought on ZoomInfo\u2019s advanced package for their frontline sellers while their marketing department added our marketing functionality of their stack as well.",
         "We also continued our momentum on the expansion side with close to 2,000 of our existing clients increasing their spend with us in the quarter. One of those clients, CommScope, a global provider of network infrastructure expanded with ZoomInfo by adding more users and bringing top of funnel activities back in-house. In addition to expanding the number of users, they also saw value in the features and functionality of our new combined platform and chose to migrate to it.",
         "In the enterprise, we continued our successful land and expand motion with more than 650 clients spending over $100,000 a year with us, representing a 60% growth in ACV for those customers. One of those customers worldwide express a 1,000 plus employees shipping and logistics company expanded their user licenses from their inside sales team to their full field sales team, an application performance and monitoring company expanded their users and added more functionality to their use of the ZoomInfo platform, gaining access to our industry-leading B2B intent product along the way while one of the largest technology companies in the world expanded into their machine learning and AI teams with our enterprise API capability",
         "With July 1st marking the start of the enforcement of the CCPA, our privacy posture becomes increasingly important to our competitive differentiation. We are and always have been a privacy first business, providing data collection notices to all of our EU and California contacts and permitting anyone in our database to opt out through our automated privacy center. Although not required by any regulation today, the expansion of our notice and choice program across the rest of our database has also been successfully progressing as we have now given direct notice to over 55% of our emailable database and expect to have provided direct notice to that entire audience by the end of 2020.",
         "As I look into the future, when we think about our market opportunity, what's really exciting is that we are at the very beginning. We are in the very early stages of targeting a large and growing addressable market, which represents more than a $25 billion market opportunity. And with low single-digit penetration rates, there are meaningful growth opportunities by continuing to leverage our efficient go-to-market engine, to add more customers to our platform, expand within the enterprise, build new solutions that add value to our existing customers, go into international markets and adjacencies like recruiting and by flexing our M&A muscle as we look for tuck-ins.",
         "We're a go-to-market intelligence platform of scale today, and we have a vision to expand our capabilities to further drive strategic automation, orchestration, and workflow through the tactical go-to-market motion that starts with our data flows through our platform and analytics layers, and enables automated go-to market-motions that produce measurable results. Given the opportunity here and the demand for more comprehensive sales and marketing solutions, we believe we can drive durable long-term growth. ",
         "Finally, I am more confident today than ever about our competitive position, our technology and the positive traction we're seeing within our market. But mostly I gain a tremendous amount of optimism about where we are headed because of the team we have put together.",
         "In Q2 alone, we added more than 150 new employees, recruiting and onboarding each one of them virtually every one of our over 1,300 employees appreciates the immense opportunity in front of our company and is motivated and committed to achieving our full potential. And while we are proud of our accomplishments to date, we are hungry to be more.",
         "With that, I'll hand it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Cameron Hyzer."

But the trick there is, it's hard to disaggregate that between the COVID related tailwinds we were seeing, and also just the enhancements that we were already making in our go-to-market engine.",
            "The real impact we're seeing is that the validation that we got from the IPO has really opened the doors for us to have more strategic conversations with our customers. And we've put our go-to-market engine on display as part of the IPO. And that's really opened the door for our \u2013 how management teams and our customer success teams to be invited in to share best practices with key executives that are customers, in a way that we hadn't otherwise been provided the opportunity to do. And so we think that really over time, we'll be able to continue to leverage that \u2013 those open doors and that'll continue to drive our growth."

I think that from a social distancing perspective, really COVID just emphasize many of the trends that we saw pre the pandemic and that businesses of all shapes and sizes were looking for ways to improve and digitize their go-to-market motions. So I think in any kind of transformation that you see, you always get an acceleration at this time, but then most of that continues kind of as the world returns to normal."

That's just accelerating a trend towards digitizing sales and marketing motions that like Cameron mentioned were already happening. And we're sitting in the middle of a larger than $25 billion total addressable market where we're less than 2% penetrated. And what you really see is companies today are taking trade show and events and travel budgets and reallocating them to content syndication or online events and to ZoomInfo. And over time, as they see the tremendous ROI our platform provides, they're going to shift more and more dollars behind ZoomInfo. And as they \u2013 and when they shift those dollars, they'll be expanding from marketing use cases to sales use cases, to data cleansing, to intent data, to lead capture, and more and more."

Obviously, the pandemic has slowed hiring in some places, but there are also many companies that continue to hire in the midst of the pandemic.

And I think you mentioned in the script that for Q2, it's the most new customer, ACV in your history. So I guess I'm curious, did that trend continue?

I guess, Henry first for you, if you think about what you've learned so far kind of selling through the pandemic, you mentioned earlier about having more time to make the case that the enterprise customers being invited into to make that strategic value proposition. Walk us through kind of how that's both trended even into the month of July and where you see that kind of peeking, does that set up for a different kind of linearity or trajectory in Q4? And then any puts and takes that you've seen or changes that you've made as a result of COVID on your go-to-market motions? I have a quick follow-up."

            "Yes. I mean, if you look back, I think, first we were surprised that the downward activity that we saw in March rebounded in the quarter, we felt really good about that. And in March our customers, we felt like a lot of our customers were deer in headlights. They didn't know how the pandemic was going to affect them. So they paused in spending. And in the quarter we saw much more of that rebound. We saw slow-to-evolve companies that were coming to us with a new imperative to change. We've got companies that used to have a hundreds of salespeople out in the field saying that they needed to find a way to make them productive and find ways to make their field sales teams able to continue to grow pipeline and closed business while they're working from home.",
            "And what that really to us indicates is a real shift from analog to digital sales motion and an acceleration of that shift. And the speed at which those organizations pivoted during the early days of COVID changing their business models, going to market in new ways. It never ceases to amaze me the fortitude and the resilience of small businesses. And it was great to see dozens of businesses and affected industries also sign on in the quarter. And I think what we'll continue to see is customers and companies who were slow to evolve, raise their hands and look for opportunities to make their sales and go-to-market motions more effective and more efficient. And I think what we're excited about is that today we are much more the organization to call to help with that transformation than we've ever been."

In the quarter, the activity around retention, certainly saw an improvement. So, we had more customers increasing their spend with us. In fact, we had close to 2,000 customers increased spend with us during the course of the quarter. So, overall we expect that we'll continue to see kind of solid net retention through the year. ",

And what we saw was that we can absolutely affect our conversion and win rates in the international market by focusing on that. And so we we've embarked on an initiative to rescan and reorganize the platform to be focused on the international market. And you'll see us in that market much more heavily in the back half of this year. And so in short, our plans around the international market haven't changed and we're excited to enter them. "

Help us to kind of close the gap between the 15% billings growth and the 40% revenue growth that we're seeing on your top line. That's it for me? Thank you."

I'd have to say go and kind of do a pro forma view of what the full billings growth would look like, but I can get back to you. But I do think it's much closer to the organic growth that we stated than 15%. "

I think you mentioned a farmer earlier that signed up. What I'm curious about is as you all have looked through the data in 2Q, for these nontraditional customers or industries, what is their buying patterns like in terms of the sales cycle as well as the deal size? And just do you see longevity in these nontraditional industries going forward? Thank you."

            "Yes. Thanks, Terry. I think first we're \u2013our business is growing across all different \u2013 all of our different industry segments. And so, we're seeing growth in these sort of nontraditional segments. One of the other types of companies that we've seen is financial services companies, who have traditionally been a much more face to face, or even in some situations door to door go-to-market motion. And so, we've seen them come to us and say look this face to face door to door motion doesn't really work for us anymore. And then we often see if it's just our overall growth motion is to sign companies up with a modest ASP and then the enterprise really grow them through our land and expand strategy.",
            "And so, we're \u2013 the motion that you'll see is we'll sign an enterprise company at a relatively lower ASP that might be our product that gets rolled out to 20 or 50 or 100 out of 1,000 different sales and go-to-market professionals. We prove ROI in that segment and then we grow beyond that. And that motion is consistent in both our traditional and nontraditional industries. And yes, we do see real success happening within those accounts. I gave an example during our IPO of a company called TentCraft that sells event tents. That's a manufacturing business, who has completely changed their go-to-market motions using ZoomInfo. I gave the example of Kaeser Compressors, which is an air products and services company. That's based in Germany. That's come onto us for our digital platform to drive their go-to-market efforts.",
            "And so \u2013 and we're already seeing early success from those companies in those nontraditional industries. The last example was I mentioned a large hotel chain that came on. And that example is really interesting because before they signed up for ZoomInfo, they did a small pilot. They booked $80,000 of revenue in the short pilot or $80,000 of bookings in the short pilot. And then \u2013 and with hundreds of thousands of dollars of pipeline built as well and so then they expanded and came on with us. And so we're seeing real ROI across both traditional and nontraditional industry then we think that's going to drive the retention rate in the future."

And that \u2013 and the whole world outside of the four corners of your website is what's driving significant amounts of insights, whether that's intent data or a company's growing or shrinking or making acquisitions or moving locations or hiring new executives, the world of insights that happen \u2013 that happens outside of your CRM and marketing automation system is much more robust than what's inside.",

So, maybe a follow up to Terry's question, but I know you guys had a lot of exposure to software and business services. I'm curious of the ACV added this quarter, what did that mix look like versus your existing business? And anything in the pipeline that suggests that there are certain end markets that are really ramping up? I'm just curious on that. Thank you."

So while we continue to grow very well within the software and business services world, other of the industries like professional services and manufacturing and so forth continue to grow faster. That's a continuation of a trend that we saw pre-COVID, but saw it through this quarter. I'd say that the one big change is that certainly industries that were more heavily impacted by COVID, whether that's hospitality or retail or travel, those did not grow as quickly within the quarter."

One of the things that we do is we use a call recording software internally, and we flag competitor mentions across all new sales and customer calls. And most competitors are mentioned less than 1% of the time. And the most referenced competitors mentioned in the single digits. And I, actually, this morning took a look at the most recent report since you asked about D&B, the most recent report, which covered July on the mentions of D&B have actually declined since February, so ultimately no changes in the competitive landscape."

So I wanted to just build on, I think, it was Brent's question, just asking about platform 10 and making great progress and getting customers converted there. Henry, do you sort of have any more anecdotal data as to what customer's feedback has been on the platform? It seems like you're combining breadth of data with intelligence and data across the Discover Oregon ZoomInfo platforms by putting them together. And then, Henry a side of \u2013 or Cameron a side of that question for you is what sort of tailwind are you seeing with respect to the ARR lift that you're seeing from customers that are converting, whether it's in pricing or additive data being purchased? Thanks."

If they're migrating from the DiscoverOrg legacy platform to the new platform, what they're telling us is that the coverage is immensely \u2013 is much, much more than they had access to in the DiscoverOrg platform. And so, they're seeing 20x the coverage of companies and contacts in the new platform than what they had access to in DiscoverOrg. And we've already integrated the breadth of the DiscoverOrg solution inside of the new combined platform. So they have all of that at their fingertips as well.",

And so, they're seeing the breadth and robustness of the solution while the DiscoverOrg migrations are seeing a much broader coverage than they've ever seen."

And obviously that's evidenced by the fact that the most of our growth actually comes from new customers and not from existing customers, but in terms of pricing, if a customer is migrating for like for like functionality and seats that tends to be a kind of my \u2013 that tends to be like a renewal like prices change, so call it kind of mid to low single digits. Obviously, one of the things that the platform does do is it allows us to more easily provide increased functionality to folks. So, in those cases we do see kind of somewhat more substantial uplift, but again, it's not super material to our growth so far."

A quick follow on, but just thinking about the bigger picture of your margin structure, it's tremendous, it'd be hard to imagine a software company being much higher than where you're at. When you look at the 25%, 26% of [indiscernible] being spent on sales and marketing, and also evaluate other markets you want to go into the opportunity to move upstream, to do more enterprise deals, move international. What happens with that line sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue over the next coming years? Can you maintain the leverage in it and hold it kind of flattish? Or does that sort of naturally go higher as you embrace bigger deal opportunities and international properties?"

As we continue to grow \u2013 and I think based on guidance and so forth, it would imply that we're going to need to grow our sales and marketing capacity as well as other parts of the organization north of 30%. So we think that that level of continuing to grow the sales and marketing capacity is a good level where we can continue to take advantage of the opportunity in front of us and drive efficiency going forward."

But, overall, I think there is a broad recognition for the value that we're providing among our customers. And, it continues to be at very nice level. Absolute churn numbers aren't something that we're overall providing, but certainly the levels that we're seeing and continued headwinds from COVID or things that we have considered in our guidance."
