         "Absolutely. So, being at Arista over 13 years now, since almost a very beginning. We were a tiny company of about 12 people when I started. And I\u2019ve seen the company grow and participate in every possible dimension of scaling our business. Now, obviously, working closely with Jayshree Ullal, our CEO; and Andy Bechtolsheim, our Founder and Chairman to define what we do with our customers and the business.",
         "At Arista I am responsible for various parts of the company, including all of the hardware development, the manufacturing operations side of things, the overall customer roadmap that we need to deliver, all of our sales support functions and any other go-to-market function that\u2019s involved in the space.",
         "I do work very closely with some of our top customers as well. So I understand the market dynamics and where we need to be headed as well. Jim, I\u2019ve been overall in the networking space for over two decades now, and hopefully, can answer any questions about legacy and new."

            "Great. So why don\u2019t we go ahead and kick things off and maybe talk about demand. This year was not a typical year. Can you talk about how you entered this year? And then the Coronavirus pandemic spread globally and kind of how you sit there and see demand now and say the next six months to 12 months?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, you\u2019re right about this year is not a typical year. This has been a very unique year, first with the pandemic, but also the fluctuations we\u2019ve seen in people\u2019s expectation and where there\u2019s volatility in the market and sort of transitions in the overall networking space.",
            "When we started 2020, we had some assumptions about what our cloud customers will do, we had assumptions for what the enterprise customers will do. And then came February, March and things took a dramatic turn.",
            "We felt things would slow down, but surprisingly the cloud market has actually held up fairly well. And some of the demand we\u2019ve seen this year has improved compared to our original expectation.",
            "On the other hand, enterprise data center demand has been healthy, but new customer acquisition growth in campus vertical for us, as an example, has been taken longer because it\u2019s not easy when customers are not meeting in person all the times.",
            "Those are generally the demand changes directly impacting Arista. But underlying our customer\u2019s business, I think, many of our customers have been surprised on how strong the demand has been for them despite this COVID environment."

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "When we think about this COVID environment, has it changed demand, say, for example, to be more cloud centric or more software centric or a rush to the cloud or a bit of a pause of what historical roadmaps may have been from some customers?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Jim Suva"
      },
      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. I would say, first of all, we should be all very proud, not just as Arista, but as an industry that the internet works, without that we wouldn\u2019t be here on this conference and other ways doing things remotely every day. And I think the internet held up really well, given the pressure that was put on it in the March timeframe.",
            "What we\u2019ve seen is a pulling effect and it\u2019s very hard for me to know whether it\u2019s a pulling up the next one year sort of demand or the next three years or five years or 10 years worth of demand pulled into the cloud sector or some of the Tier 2 services, simply because they are part of the digital economy and it was very hard for businesses to function like they used to, so they all pivoted to getting access to resources or connectivity or services or apps in the cloud.",
            "So I think that has worked very, very well. We\u2019ve, obviously, seen that in our results as well and the improvements in the guidance. But that\u2019s really the biggest change we\u2019ve seen that infrastructure investments have become critical and companies now valued even more than before."

         "Remarks": [
            "When we think about the challenges across the situation for tech companies this year, there\u2019s been more than COVID. COVID is one of them. But also there were tariffs. There was sourcing of components, where they\u2019re assembled, where they\u2019re shipped to import duties, who you can buy from, who you can sell to and all of this. Many companies have been adjusting their business practices to become more nimble. How has Arista changed or adapted its business practices, because you are the Chief Operating Officer. So, unfortunately, all this work gets pushed onto you and you have to resolve all these different operational challenges. Can you talk about those?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Jim Suva"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Well, I have a great team that lets me sleep at night. So, I don\u2019t have to do everything myself. But you\u2019re absolutely right that the environment has been quite tasking. The number of changes that we\u2019ve had to go through as an industry is beyond what any company can prepare for when you are trying to have a nimble supply chain and make changes to do around tariffs or geopolitical pressures.",
            "But in addition to that, because of COVID, a way to think of this is that roughly in this calendar year, about three months of the output of the capacity, the world was really shutdown in different countries, different suppliers and so on.",
            "So we\u2019re trying to make door with the remaining 75% capacity to catch up to the 100% demand and not go back to any legacy supply chain that may be negatively impacted with tariff and whatnot.",
            "So the team has been working hard towards that, being nimble and your decision making being multi-sourced, multi-vendor, multiple locations at which we manufacture has all helped us balance all of that out.",
            "And then this year was unique. We had to deal with the simplest of problems where we figured out how to build our products, despite all the COVID challenges and meet demand in many ways. But I guess what the company that manufactures the cardboard box couldn\u2019t get the permit from the local government to operate the company and you had to go deal with those types of issues as well.",
            "So, I think, we\u2019ve done well. To navigate this, I think, we have through the worst of the issues and it\u2019s simply now gradually recovering to catch up to overall demand and build back a buffer."

         "Remarks": [
            "Beautiful. Now also as Chief Operating Officer, Jayshree being CEO, she basically said, hey, it\u2019s time to go into the campus switching market. Can you help us understand about the campus switching market kind of what you\u2019re doing, what\u2019s your strategy of attack as a COO to go into that and does this Coronavirus help you with that or closet or how should we think about it?"

      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Well, we\u2019re not as top down a company. So this is actually a collective thinking and decision of the entire management team over several years to go after the campus investment including a lot of demand and pull from our own customers, saying, Arista this makes sense for you. We love your products. Why can\u2019t I buy your technology also for my campus and simplify my life. So I think, it\u2019s a culmination of various customer demands, as well as our own readiness to go enter this space.",
            "To some extent the campus domain is a leverage investment for us, because it leverages our hardware technology, EOS, that\u2019s similar features, maybe with some enhancements to go meet the campus needs that we have been building and I think that had been coming along really, really well until COVID hit.",
            "Now with pre-COVID, we had surprisingly many new customers adopting Arista technology in their campus and then these are customers who had never used Arista products before, but for the first time when they started, they started in the campus of all things rather than data center that you would typically expect.",
            "Post-COVID, it\u2019s been harder to meet all these customers in person. So there\u2019s certainly be some impact there. But our existing Arista customers have started to do a lot more testing and deployments of our campus products as well. So it\u2019s all been balanced off with the 6,000 plus customers that we have today."

         "Remarks": [
            "And I believe your company has laid out some goals for the campus switching market, if my memory is right and it\u2019s been a blur of a day to day, but was $200 million in revenues, was that kind of what they were talking about maybe in five-ish quarters or something? Am I right on that or maybe you can correct me?"

      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "No. You are correct. Our first goal was to achieve $100 million in our first year -- first full year of the campus offering, which we did accomplish and we announced that in our Q2 results. The next goal we have is to double that from $100 million to $200 million in the four quarters that may take five quarters or six quarters, especially given the COVID environment.",
            "We are on track for that. So we\u2019ll come back and report that in time, as well as we make progress and try and hit those targets. But so far, I would say, the campus offering is well received by customers. There\u2019s a lot in there, which is not just building the hardware, but also the automation suite that goes around it, including CloudVision.",
            "And very recently we introduced CloudVision as-a-service that you can manage infrastructure, run your data center and campus network all remotely, and that has been very well received by customers as well. So, I think, those are the ankles that will let us grow."

         "Remarks": [
            "When we look at the competitive landscape, some of your competitors are talking about increasing their focus to gain share with the web scale customers, whether that\u2019s white boxes or some of the other. Is this a threat to your customer base and what are you seeing as a result? Any pressure on pricing or how should we think about, they\u2019re all saying we\u2019re going to go after the web scale customers?"

      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. Jim, I\u2019m surprised they\u2019re saying that because it\u2019s not like they forgot about these customers for the last 10 years. They\u2019ve been there every year competing hard to win and you have to execute very well, not just on building a chip, but building a good product, including the software, including doing integration and customization that the customers need.",
            "And truly being honest and supporting these customers and making the right decision and deploying and solving their problems. And these customers have always been multi-vendors, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they give up minority share to some of these other players like they have done in the past.",
            "But I think Arista will do well. We are very well positioned with these customers. The cloud titans love working with us and giving us more and more work to do, and more and more projects that we\u2019re involved in with them. So, I think, we will be fine despite all the claims from competition."

      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Now when we look back the year 2019 and so far 2020, Arista saw a meaningful slowdown by two of its web scale customers. Can you talk about that whether they\u2019re the same issues or different issues and how should we think about is this permanent or temporary?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Jim Suva"
      },
      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. So there were two slowdowns that people remember. Remember there were five years of positive surprises prior to that. So this is a volatile market and the -- in 2019, one of our large cloud titans didn\u2019t really slowed down, but they shifted their spent from one quarter to another.",
            "So when you look at the full year 2019 that cloud titan customer did fairly well, they actually grew with us in overall spend and we did well with them as well. So there was no major slowdown there except for a shift from one quarter to the other.",
            "And the second case, there has been a slowdown, which we mentioned in our Q3 2019 earnings call, in November of 2019, that one cloud titan customer did decide to delay their data center refresh and some growth waiting for a new CPU cycle that investment really got pushed out to 2021. So 2020 is a slow year for that customer and in 2021 they start again to invest and grow in that space.",
            "We\u2019re not surprised by that cloud companies are way large and they\u2019re also quick in making decisions and changing the plan, so there is volatility. And we\u2019ve seen five years of upside and two quarters of weakness in this overall business and we\u2019re not too worried. The long-term, these things to even out and they like us, they like working with us, so I think Arista will have a very healthy share of the spent from these customers."

      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And sticking still on this topic, if we look at the first one, you mentioned a shift in spending from one quarter to the other, is the spending levels back to, and I\u2019m not talking about Coronavirus, because that influences everything. But aside from the shift, is it back to the normal levels or higher or lower or how should we think about when they shift the spending, was there actually an impact to the level?"

      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "The overall 2019 spent for that customer was higher than 2018. So that actually improved their spending and overall CapEx as well."

      },
      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And then on the second customer, do they typically do this waiting for a new CPU cycle? Is that pretty normal or is that kind of new?"

      },
      "18": {
         "Remarks": [
            "That was new. And I think to some extent, this also reflects the maturity of their business where they\u2019re trying to squeeze out more efficiencies and would rather wait for a new cycle that can get them by for the next three years to five years, rather than investing in something now they feel may not last the full cycle. But so they were able to stretch it out and kudos to them for making such a bold decision, right? These are not easy to do at that scale. But I think technically that is the right choice that they made."

         "Speaker": "Anshul Sadana"
      },
      "19": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I don\u2019t think any discussion would be complete if we don\u2019t talk about white boxes. So can you talk about white boxes, because there are many people who think that this is really going to create pressure on the company\u2019s profitability sales growth? And we just hear a lot about white boxes. So let\u2019s just go ahead and divulge on the top of a white boxes. There\u2019s a lot we can talk about?"

         "Speaker": "Jim Suva"
      },
      "20": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Absolutely. First of all, when some companies talk about white boxes and people think of these companies as the biggest consumers of white boxes, they forget that, the same companies are Arista\u2019s largest customers. So if they were only using white boxes, they wouldn\u2019t be such large customers for us. They are very, very good customers. There\u2019s a lot of work we do with them.",
            "Lastly speaking, I would say, the industry in this space has maintained status quo. Companies that have been designing their own switches, including the ones, especially the ones that did this before Arista existed as a company or was a sizable company, those companies are continuing to build on their own.",
            "Companies that have been buying from the industry and from companies -- from vendors like Arista are continuing to buy from companies like us. They have not gone back and started designing white boxes.",
            "In addition, there are a few in the middle that build on their own and also buy from the industry and are more focused on a core development effort to a common design spec and they are maintaining that status quo as well and we\u2019ve seen some of those announcements in hearing from Arista at the previous OCP events. So despite the charter on white box, then so much talk about bike boxes, the reality is that this market has maintained status quo for roughly the last five years or so.",
            "And what you have to keep in mind is these customers have a lot of money. They have needs for technology. And if their needs are underserved or unmet, then they will go a different route. But if we can meet those needs then these customers do not have as much of an incentive to go invest in this space when from an opportunity cost standpoint, they could be building other solutions to improve their own business.",
            "And that\u2019s where the partnership with Arista\u2019s key. We are very, very unique. This is not a play where you sell a box and you run away. You really have to be part of the network and help the customer build the best network and run it with them, support them, think about the roadmap, help them transition, and then you maintain a long-term partnership with them, which is where we are typically with them."

      "22": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I would say the cloud market is already pretty aggressive on pricing. These are almost cost plus type of situations. This is not where you command a very high premium or high margin. These are way competitive environments and they have been like this for ever since Arista has been involved with them for the last 10 plus years.",
            "So I don\u2019t think the pricing dynamics have changed or are likely to change in a big way. There\u2019s always the need for efficiency. There\u2019s always a need to improve and we have to stay focused on that. So it doesn\u2019t mean you just compress margins. It could also mean work on along with the customer to figure out how to reduce their costs."

Has the value of incumbency helped out Arista, meaning your customers just simply can\u2019t open the doors to entertain new products from competitors, any thoughts about incumbency under Coronavirus?"

      "24": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. I would say, it depends on the customer\u2019s ability to switch. The largest customers have fairly skilled teams and they were committed to switching they would. So the only way you can survive is by being ahead technically, not by being complacent because you\u2019re the incumbent.",
            "At the same time, I think, some of our larger competitors have been enjoying incumbency in the legacy enterprise space and those customers are more, I would say, risk averse and are unlikely to move quickly in the COVID environment.",
            "But the incumbency factor for enterprise, I would say, is more important than in the cloud and the cloud companies will move when they have to and they\u2019re busy transitioning to some of our own next-gen products."

         "Remarks": [
            "If we look at CapEx of your customers and I know not all CapEx dollars are spent to you or away from you or not, but in aggregate some of the large key cloud customers have been moving their CapEx numbers lower during the past few months. Should we be concerned about that reduction in their CapEx because in essence their CapEx is your addressable market that you\u2019re going after?"

      "26": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. As you mentioned, the networking spend is a very tiny fraction of the overall CapEx. The overall CapEx includes the very large data center facilities, all of the power and cooling infrastructure, all of the compute and storage they have to buy and the network that goes along with it. So the networks spend is a lot less of the overall CapEx. So sometimes even though the overall CapEx may go up and down, the network spends may not be as impacted.",
            "But having said that, some of our customers have been raising their CapEx budgets and as their earnings are announced and some have lower estimates for this year with the comment that they will start investing again next year. So, we actually not as worried about the changes that all of you are now seeing to some extent, some of that was built into our models because that\u2019s the guidance we\u2019re getting from our customers on directionally where they\u2019re headed and we\u2019re getting ready for some next-gen upgrades that will start in 2021 with them."

But, obviously, even we are not privy to all the details. These are customers having discussed internally and we get a small snippet of how it will impact us.

And customers have been quite happy to drop it by backwards compatibility to 100-gig, it works well with the high bandwidth that they needed for different use cases and so on.",
            "The 50 is a large number significantly more than our cloud titans. So it is a broad spread across titans. I would say, each and every one of our cloud titan now has some of the 400-gig products within pilot or smaller deployments and so on.",
            "We have many of the Tier 2 clouds already using these products. We have some of the financial institutions using these products for high bandwidth needs. We have some AI related use cases where people are using 400-gig products from us and then we have certain service providers in Tier 2 cloud as well already deploying this.",
            "So it\u2019s spread wide across pretty much every vertical of ours, but it\u2019s wherever you need more bandwidth, whether it\u2019s streaming, video applications or sort of backend storage or AI where you need to opt the performance yet again."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. So unlike the 100-gig wave, which came around 2016, 2017, where all our customers and the entire world switched to 100-gig very rapidly and that was based on a product that was roughly the same cost as 40-gig, the same power as 40-gig and fully backwards compatible to 40-gigs. So there was no reason to buy 40-gigs at that point, you might always just buy 100-gig switch. 400-gig is a bit different. The products too cost more and they consume more power as well.",
            "So as a result of that, what we\u2019re seeing is a fork in the road where certain customers, including in the titan space, are moving to 400-gig, but there are certain customers that are actually sticking to other speeds, including 100-gig or 200-gig.",
            "And we cater to all of them very, very well, but there seems to be this expectation in the market that there\u2019s a big 400-gig wave coming. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. In fact, 100-gig will continue to grow in volume in both 2020 and maybe even 2021, but doesn\u2019t mean already [ph], we have our 400-gig products as well."

      "36": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. So, in general, our product gross margins are really dependent on customer mix and product mix within that. There are certain products that are high value and higher margin. There are certain products that are more compressed on margins and then the cloud titans, especially at the highest volume and lowest margin as well. So it really comes down to that mix within a certain quarter.",
            "But with all of our verticals and all of the business that we have in overall, it balances out in the 63% to 65% overall in gross margin range for the company. So this is a slightly higher product, is slightly slower when you balance that it comes into that range.",
            "However, in calendar Q2 especially, the logistics start shipping our products around the world from the manufacturing sites, tourist or distribution sites, and so on. The freight costs are shot up quite a bit and if we can go back to just March, April, you remember that many of the commercial flights stopped running and even today the air flights are sort of much lower schedule, a little lower frequency than ever before.",
            "So the freight market, the price has shot up in the spot market and that\u2019s really what impacted the shipping costs and logistics and so on impacted our margins. I think that\u2019s short-term, maybe there\u2019s some overhang into Q3, but that\u2019s not a long lasting effect, I think, will recovered through this time and move on."

And a lot of times I think, oh, yes, then in six months or whatever time period, they\u2019re going to go away. Do you think the freight costs go back lower or is this just something of take advantage of shipping costs are higher? I mean, my mail costs don\u2019t go lower and so I\u2019m just kind of wondering about your visibility into shipping costs actually going lower as opposed to just staying at these elevated levels."

They just couldn\u2019t run the normal routes and they have now been improving and just to have enough business of their own, any of the commercial airlines are running more cargo flights than before. So that market has improved and I think the country improve, as well as we progressed through the year.",

There has been a recent change in the server industry, which I know you\u2019re not in the server industry, but servers and networking and switches all hook up together of servers kind of seeing extended life or also known as sweating the asset light a little bit longer. And I see you nodding your head and kind of smiling or chuckling up this extended lifer or sweating the assets light. Do you see that in your customers? I know at some point you\u2019d think they can only take so much elongation, but is there any Arista assets being used longer than expected and replacement cycles not being as you know as frequent as what you\u2019re hoping for?"

I have an investor question, he asked, could you please ask them about Huawei in Europe and what their investors getting at is, in the U.S. we know Huawei is kind of on the end of the list and not able to do sales, but what about in Europe? It seems like the ripple effect is having an opportunity there in Europe from a market positioning for Arista potentially. Is that true or how do you look at Huawei globally as a competitor and they\u2019re getting some security concerns or pushback similar to what we have here in the United States?"

But I would say, the general themes you have covered, right? It\u2019s been about how is your cloud titan business do, what about the claims from your competitors and what about campus and the other growth vectors in enterprise? I think you\u2019ve covered the key points. That\u2019s largely been the theme, I would say, in every discussion we\u2019ve had today."

But we\u2019re not seeing that. And my conclusion is what\u2019s happened in the white box space for companies that design their own products, right? Because you have to think of white boxes as two different markets. One is one or two or three companies that designed their own switches. The rest is the -- other is the entire other rest of the market where you could buy a standard white box and run our software or someone else\u2019s software.",
            "So companies that design their own switches, I think one of them has switched an ODM vendor. They went from their previous ODM vendor to a new one. This new ODM vendor, I think, is bragging that they\u2019ve gained a lot of market share. So everyone thought maybe Arista has lost market share. That\u2019s not true.

So I do work very closely with the Jayshree, Ita, Andy, Kenneth and so on. We worry less about titles inside the company. So the discussions happen almost hourly and daily on various dimensions here.",
            "We\u2019re quite focused on winning and growing in both the short-term and the long-term, and the investments being made to make sure that happens. The outcomes for, let\u2019s say, 2021 are really dependent on how the cloud market does. If the cloud is growing, I think, we\u2019ll do well. And if the enterprise is growing and I think we\u2019ll do well.",
            "So a lot of the growth rate questions that people have really come down to that and we\u2019ll be cautious. We\u2019re not going to get ahead of our skis and start giving guidance or bidding when we don\u2019t know all the facts. We have to get there as we get there, but we have immense confidence in our ability to execute and do well and win the next few rounds here as we meet with customers on next-gen products and so on. So I think the opportunity will keep on getting better for us.",
            "When you include data centre switching, when you include both titans, when you include service providers, when you include some of the router opportunity and then campus switching, there all the time we are going after is much bigger than before. And as a result, it gives us immense ability to keep on growing into that space for quite some time to come.",
            "And that keeps me excited. There is so much to do, so many problems to solve for customers, so much to innovate. It\u2019s really connecting the dots on our technology. What our customers need. How do we fulfil that and fend off competition that I think the cycle will go on for a long time to come. So if you\u2019re an investor, you have to look at these sort of puts and takes, but the market is doing well and there is no big recession, I think, we\u2019ll do very well as well."
