         "Thanks, Rob. For the second quarter of 2020, we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $215.3 million, or $20.85 per diluted share. For the quarter, we reported AFFO per diluted share negative $12.32. Adjusted EBITDAre totaled negative $56.5 million for the quarter.",
         "At the end of the second quarter, we had $4.1 billion of mortgage loans, with a blended average interest rate of 3.7%. This average rate does not take into account any default rates. Our loans were 9% fixed rate and 91% floating rate. Our loans are all non-recourse and we have no corporate loans.",
         "As Rob mentioned, we have signed forbearance or other agreements on six loans secured by 24 hotels, and are discussing forbearance agreements with our property-level lenders on all other loans.",
         "We ended the quarter with $274 million of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $165 million and restricted cash of $95 million. The vast majority of that restricted cash is comprised of lender and manager held reserve accounts. We have been and continue to work with our property managers and lenders in order to utilize these lender and manager held reserves to fund operating shortfalls at our hotels.",
         "At the end of the quarter, we also had $13 million in due from third-party hotel managers. This represents cash held by one of our property managers, which is also available to fund hotel operating costs.",
         "As of June 30, 2020, our portfolio consisted of 116 hotels, with 24,719 net rooms. Our current share count stands at 12.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding, which is comprised of 10.5 million shares of common stock and 2.1 million OP units and reflects our recent 1-for-10 reverse stock split.",
         "On July 20, 2020, we filed a preliminary S-4, describing an offer to exchange our preferred stock for common stock and cash. As this is a preliminary filing, we cannot comment on the offering and we\u2019ll have to wait until the registration statement is effective to discuss the details around this offering.",
         "On July 27, 2020, we also filed a preliminary proxy statement, calling a special meeting of our common stockholders for the purpose of approving matters related to our proposed preferred stock exchange offer. The proxy statement is also subject to SEC review in common. And as a result, we will have to wait for its effectiveness as well in order to comment on it.",
         "This concludes our financial review. And I would now like to turn it over to Jeremy to discuss our asset management activities for the quarter."
      ],
      "Jeremy Welter": [
         "Thank you Deric. Comparable RevPAR for our portfolio decreased 88.3% during the second quarter of 2020. Hotel EBITDA flow-through was 48%. Business in April was driven by COVID-19 responders and healthcare workers, where we saw significant participation in Marriott Bridgewater, Embassy Suites New York Manhattan Times Square and Embassy Suites Santa Clara.",
         "Transient leisure travel, especially on weekends, returned later in the quarter. There was very little corporate business travel. Generally, RevPAR bottomed out by mid-April and experienced steady week-over-week growth over the next few months.",
         "Also, select service and extended stay hotels tended to fare better, driven by long-term stays in essential travel segments. When it became apparent that the COVID-19 pandemic was going to severely impact our hotels\u2019 performance, we took swift action to put ourselves in position for long-term success.",
         "During the second quarter, we reduced operating expenses significantly by 73.6%, or $185 million relative to last year. These cuts resulted in hotel EBITDA flow-through of 48%, which is a remarkable accomplishment by our asset managers and our property managers working together.",
         "We responded quickly and aggressively to reduce costs in response to the unprecedented decline in hotel revenues. Of the 23 hotels, where we temporarily suspended operations, all but four have reopened. We suspended services at these hotels in order to minimize costs, where there was little business in the market.",
         "These are unprecedented times. And as a result, asset management, property management and the brands are all working together as never before. We want to bring back our associates as soon as we can once hotel demand recovers. Our associates have been stretched to their limits, working through significant challenges, but folks have risen to the occasion. We\u2019re proud as a management team to see how everyone has contributed while being asked to do more for less.",
         "The following are a few of the many steps we have taken at our hotels to reduce expenses and generate revenue. We have reduced staff through furloughs and layoffs to skeleton crews and have put a freeze on employee hiring and are deferring new hires. We\u2019re scheduling partial shifts when full shifts are not necessary, and we have substantially eliminated housekeeping service for stayovers.",
         "We have substantially eliminated van transportation, airport shuttle service, valet parking services, turndown service, and all amenities that exceed brand standards. We have suspended services at concierge lounges, M Clubs and spas and kids clubs. We have blocked off and shutdown floors and wings of hotels and have set all thermostats in rooms and public spaces to temperatures that conserve the most power.",
         "We have turned off in-room refrigerators and unplugged kitchen, back of house, and office equipment. We\u2019ve suspended services at many food and beverage outlets. We have renegotiated pricing on, or are cancelling service contracts.",
         "We are working diligently to collect cancellation fees or partner with group customers to rebook their programs for a later date. Our hotel has participated in Hilton\u2019s Frontline program and Marriott\u2019s Rooms for Responders and Community Caregiver rates. And we have registered hotels with FEMA, CLC, Hotels for Hope, state lodging associations, and California\u2019s hotels for healthcare workers.",
         "We\u2019re actively seeking how we can best partner with local and city groups to help in our communities and provide shelter for first responders and vulnerable populations. Additionally, our focus has been on securing partnerships with long-term projects, airline crews and universities to provide student housing during upcoming semesters.",
         "As I mentioned earlier, we had a number of hotels successfully participate in Hilton and Marriott\u2019s room programs for responders. For example, the Marriott Bridgewater averaged 60 rooms per night through Marriott\u2019s program in April and May, contributing to hotel EBITDA flow-through of 52% during the second quarter, while comparable RevPAR fell 83.1%.",
         "In addition, the guestroom renovation was started on June 15, following a pause due to New Jersey restrictions and completion is estimated for September. Another one of our hotels that helped its local community is Marriott Research Triangle Park in Durham, North Carolina. A local shelter bought out the hotel for the duration of the second quarter, actually leading to an occupancy increase of 19.2%, despite comparable RevPAR decreasing 49.1%. Hotel EBITDA flow-through was 65% and EBITDA margin grew 73 basis points.",
         "Since early May, our focus has shifted to ensure we have strategies in place to accommodate pent-up leisure travel. The Lakeway Resort in Austin, Texas is a good example of how drive-to leisure markets drove results, especially on weekends. Attracting leisure travelers, the hotel rebounded towards the end of the second quarter, with 71% occupancy in June and a sellout every weekend in June. Despite comparable RevPAR for the second quarter decreasing 43.8%, rate increased 1.8% and hotel EBITDA flow-through was 56%.",
         "During the last few years, we have invested significant capital in renovating our portfolio to maintain competitiveness. Looking ahead to the second-half of 2020, these investments will provide us with a competitive advantage, while our industry weathers the storm brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "Additionally, our capital investment strategies will allow us to allocate more capital shrewdly for the remainder of the year, including the completion of the guestroom renovation at the Marriott Bridgewater towards the end of the third quarter.",
         "That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we move to Q&A, I want to thank our brand partners, Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt for the remarkable efforts on our behalf and their continued partnership with us during these unprecedented times.",
         "We will now open the call for Q&A."

         "Good day, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s conference call to review the results for Ashford Hospitality Trust for the second quarter of 2020 and to update you on recent developments.",
         "On the call today will be Rob Hays, President and Chief Executive Officer; Deric Eubanks, Chief Financial Officer; Jeremy Welter, Chief Operating Officer.

         "Greetings, and welcome to the Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. Second Quarter 2020 Results Conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.",
         "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jordan Jennings, Investor Relations for Ashford Hospitality Trust. Thank you. You may begin."
      ],
      "Robison Hays": [
         "Good morning, and welcome to our call. I hope everyone has continued to be safe and healthy. And these last several months are unlike anything most of us have experienced in our lifetimes, and these remain challenging times for our country, the economy and, of course, the hospitality industry.",
         "I\u2019ll start with the current environment and how Ashford Trust has managed through the pandemic in the early parts of this recovery. And after that, Deric will review our financial results and Jeremy will provide an operational update on our portfolio.",
         "This quarter has been defined by the coronavirus pandemic. And while we have made progress getting our business back up and running, the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. hospitality industry and the day-to-day operations of our hotels has been profound.",
         "As we discussed on our last earnings call, our response to this pandemic has been swift and comprehensive. We have focused our efforts on providing a safe environment for guests and our staff of the properties. And while at the same time, taking aggressive measures to protect our properties and maintain financial flexibility, so we can be in a position to return to profitability as the economy opens up and travel resumes.",
         "Additionally, given the economic impact of this pandemic, we were required to make difficult decisions and temporarily suspend operations at many of our properties. I\u2019m pleased to report that we currently have only four properties with suspended operations, compared to 23 properties at the time of our last earnings call, and those last few properties should be reopening very soon.",
         "As we look at our portfolio, we continue to believe the fastest segments to rebound will be leisure and other transient business, with the group segments slower in its recovery. We are concerned about the state of the industry what it may be after Labor Day, when leisure travel slows and hotels typically rely more heavily on group and business travel, as those segments are unlikely to rebound quickly.",
         "We do not yet feel confident that we will see a material improvement in occupancy as we go into fall, which is concerning. There continues to be significant reopening uncertainties in the economy, with newly reinstated COVID-19 travel advisories and restrictions in some parts of the country. While we do not expect another national shutdown, we do anticipate some regional impact, as travelers are again encouraged to stay-at-home.",
         "Operationally, we are focused on mitigating the financial impact of the pandemic with cost control initiatives, including working closely with our property managers to manage cost structures and maximize liquidity at the properties. And this is where our relationship with our affiliated property manager, Remington, really sets us apart.",
         "Remington has been able to quickly cut costs and rapidly adjust to this new operating environment. And we\u2019re proud of their efforts and believe it sets us up well to outperform as the industry recovers. Jeremy will discuss this in more detail shortly.",
         "We have also significantly reduced our planned spend for capital expenditures for the year. We suspended both our common and preferred dividends and we\u2019ve reduced our corporate G&A by approximately 25%. Deric will discuss this in more detail around our liquidity shortly. But throughout the quarter, we have taken action to maintain our financial flexibility, including not making principal or interest payments on nearly all of our loans since April 1.",
         "We have been actually working with our lenders and our property-level debt to arrange mutually acceptable forbearance arrangements to reduce our near-term cash utilization and improve our liquidity. We\u2019ve had some success with those discussions, including executing forbearance or other agreements on six loans secured by 24 hotels.",
         "In addition, we have come to agreement in terms on several other loan pools that are currently being documented, and we hope to have them signed up in the next few weeks. Discussions on the remaining loan pools are ongoing.",
         "Forbearance agreements typically allow us to defer interest on loans for up to six months subject to certain conditions. They also allow the company to utilize lender and manager held reserve accounts, which are included in restricted cash on the company\u2019s balance sheet in order to fund operating shortfalls at the hotels.",
         "We look forward to providing additional information as we continue to work through this process. It is likely, however, that we will be unable to agree on forbearance terms with all of our loan pools, and investors should anticipate that we may be handing back some assets to lenders in the months to come.",
         "There are several reasons why we may decide to give back access to lenders. One, there\u2019s negative equity in the loan pool that is unlikely to reach positive equity in the medium to long-term; two, there are significant cash requirements of the property, such as operating shortfalls, ongoing debt service or CapEx that we do not believe are economical; or three, terms the lenders or special servicers are proposing are onerous and make keeping the property unattractive.",
         "And while we hope to retain as many of our properties as possible, I do think it is important for investors to know that we will plan on handing back assets that do not create long-term value for our shareholders.",
         "The first-half of 2020 has been extraordinary by any measure. And I cannot be proud of the effort and the performance of our teams during this time. I believe our response has been the right one for both short and long-term health of our guests, our portfolio of the communities we serve and our shareholders.",
         "We\u2019re closely monitoring the fluid situation, have plans in place to continue to reopen closed properties, as government edicts allow and business demand and conditions improve. Our management team has extensive experience in effectively navigating tough market environments and extended downturns. Each crisis is never invariably different, but we believe we have the right management team in place to protect the long-term values of our assets in the company.",
         "So I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Deric to review our second quarter financial performance."

            "Thank you. Good morning. I have a multi-part question on the operations side of things. Can you discuss a little bit more of the role of Remington in terms of finding these cost savings? Talk a little bit more about how much of an advantage that relationship is for you in this environment?",
            "And then, in the prepared remarks, you ran through a number of examples in terms of cost savings, which is helpful. Does it look like the break-even occupancy levels at your properties today are much different than what you saw in a few months ago?",
            "And then lastly, do you think there could be further room to tweak the operating structure to preserve cash? Or has most of the low-hanging fruit already been harvested at this point?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Tyler Batory"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. This is Jeremy. I\u2019ll take those questions. Remington is a huge advantage. There\u2019s no question about it. And I do want to give credit to our management team and actually the direction of Monty as well. We were well prepared heading into the pandemic. We saw it as a big risk for us very early \u2013 as early as really late January, when we started to track some of the information overseas.",
            "So in early May, when it was very clear to us that this was a huge risk, we started aggressively cutting costs immediately. And it definitely was a lot quicker off the blocks with Remington, because we had control over those assets. And so they were weeks ahead of either brand managers.",
            "I do think that our brand managers have been incredible partners during this process. So I do want to commend them and let them know that we appreciate all the flexibility they\u2019ve had, not only in the hotels that they manage for us, but the ones that they franchise to us, because they have been incredibly, incredibly understanding, flexible and partnering on what we need to do to conserve cash across the Board.",
            "But there\u2019s no question that Remington has been a huge advantage for us during this downturn and continuously. And so they have been stretched very thinly. We cut a lot of corporate positions that would otherwise be allocated some of the properties as well. So just across the Board, we had substantial reductions in costs.",
            "Moving on to the next question that you had on occupancy \u2013 break-even occupancy, you mentioned maybe a few months ago. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s changed from a few months ago, because a few months ago, to me is, it seems like years ago during this pandemic, which has lasted a lot longer than we would have hoped.",
            "But a few months ago and, let\u2019s say, May, April, I think, we were quick to retool all of our hotel operations. I mean, we\u2019ve gone through every level of expense detail you can imagine. We are getting GNL level reporting from all of our management companies. We\u2019re going through all of that information on a weekly basis. So we have really dissected our properties down and rebuilding them up in the new expense model.",
            "So as it relates to a few months ago, I think, the occupancy break-even is probably similar. But from maybe six to nine to 12 months ago, materially different, materially different in terms of how we\u2019re operating our hotels today. And we\u2019ll continue to operate them in the near to mid to maybe even long-term versus what they were, let\u2019s say, during 2019 or January of this year.",
            "So much different model. And our associates have been very understanding and accommodating and everybody across the Board has rolled up their sleeves to put in the hard work and effort to just retool our business model.",
            "In terms of further room for expense, costs and cuts, I think at the property-level, I think, we\u2019ve kind of reached that point. There might be a few contracts that maybe we had. Service agreements that were underlying, and maybe the vendor wasn\u2019t as understanding. And so we might be able to cut those costs or not renew them as they come up.",
            "So I think there\u2019s probably a little bit, but there\u2019s not any low-hanging fruit at this point. Certainly, on the property tax side, I think, you\u2019ll see some significant reductions in property taxes next year. There just has to be in terms of valuations for hotels. So that\u2019s certainly a big number.",
            "And in terms of property insurance, hopefully, in the next renewal, which would be June of next year, we might be able to get some more savings. But aside from that, I think, it\u2019s just continued efforts and incredibly close monitoring on a daily basis.",
            "I mean, the reporting we\u2019re getting on a daily basis of all our hotels, how they\u2019re performing, we\u2019ve got a really, really good pulse of our operations. And I felt like we had that before this pandemic, but even more so just because everybody is working around the clock to preserve value and maximize value for our shareholders."

            "Okay, perfect. I appreciate all that detail. And to follow-up, this is just a general question. In terms of a company structure and the preferreds, I know you can\u2019t comment specifically here. But at a high-level, what sort of restructuring options have you considered?

And so, we\u2019ve got to kind of be careful on commenting on those, so as not to be deemed soliciting. So I encourage you and others listening to see the docs.",
            "But I think, generally, frankly, I think all things are on the table. We\u2019ve looked at and we\u2019re currently looking at a variety of ways to raise capital, drive ways to partner. It\u2019s more of \u2013 we\u2019re in a situation where, as we sit here, now we feel like we have ample liquidity to deal with \u2013 but we got to deal with now. But that amount is finite, and we don\u2019t know how long this crisis is going to last.",
            "And so we\u2019ve got to be proactive to try to figure out our plans and contingency plans and contingency plans upon contingency plans. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re undertaking. But I think, what I would do is, I mean, we \u2013 I think, we\u2019ve laid out in the documents kind of a list of options and alternatives that, that we will be looking at. And a lot of that\u2019ll just depend on the \u2013 what happens here over the next few months in regards to that process."

I guess, maybe why haven\u2019t you waited to see what the other three quarters of your debt amendments and forbearance agreements are going to look like before you proceed?"

But if I waited until all of those are wrapped up, I just don\u2019t have confidence that I\u2019ll have all of them wrapped up at a period of time.",

And so we\u2019ve just got to be proactive and make decisions and we can\u2019t miss the good for the sake of the perfect. And so that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re going to move forward that with that."

            "That\u2019s a good question. We \u2013 prior to me stepping into this role, the company had marketed a couple of assets that had, in our opinion, significant equity value to get a market check into to see if that was a source of capital that we wanted to raise. The company decided, obviously, to pull those back, given the \u2013 dramatically lower those values were than pre-COVID prices. So those aren\u2019t really particularly attractive.",
            "I think it\u2019s something that will \u2013 they\u2019re not entirely off the table. But as I sit now, it\u2019s a lesser of a priority. We\u2019ve got a variety of different categories and options we\u2019re looking at and investigating and that may be a part of it. It\u2019s just right now, we\u2019ve got kind of enough other things that we\u2019re focused on that, frankly, I think, are more substantive and can give raise more substantive capital than asset sales.

There may be assets that may need to go back, as I said in our comments, and we want to retain as many properties as we can.",

And you\u2019ve now seen it in our financial results in terms of our second quarter numbers, along with the job losses that have \u2013 that happened in our industry.",
            "So it\u2019s been unfortunate to this point that our elected officials haven\u2019t done more to assist our industry. The PPP did not work for our industry as it was hoped and really designed to. It just wasn\u2019t enough help. Our industry, specifically, it just has been hit too hard for that to be very helpful.",
            "So to this point, nothing has been done. There was a \u2013 as you\u2019ve mentioned, there was a bipartisan bill that was introduced in the house yesterday. It\u2019s called the HOPE Act. And it basically take some of the cash that\u2019s part of the CARES Act and would allow the Fed and the Treasury to use that for commercial property owners that have experienced a significant revenue loss and use that as a source of liquidity to keep their loans current, which would be a huge help for us and not just us, but for other property owners that are all in the same position that we\u2019re in.",
            "Where in some cases, hotels were considered essential businesses and stayed open, even though there\u2019s very little demand. But in other cases, local jurisdictions forced hotels to shutdown. And it just doesn\u2019t make any sense that a government could force an owner to close their property just so a lender can take it back from them. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.",

As Rob said, we can\u2019t just sit here and put all of our \u2013 just put all our chips on that and that happening. But we are hopeful, we do think it makes a lot of sense.",

It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s hard to even fathom the numbers coming out of my mouth in terms of the financial results that we\u2019ve had to report, so."

Are you in touch with or plan to be in touch with those type of pools of capital that are being created? Unfortunately, they\u2019re going to be really trying to get good pricing.

            "And fundamentally, we\u2019re trying to make those decisions based upon economics and based upon whether or not we think those assets have a real path to creating shareholder value. There are certain assets in our pools, where frankly, it\u2019s going to be likely that some may go back, because either maybe they had issues prior to even this pandemic or they\u2019re in markets or situations, where they may not be able to cover debt service for years.",
            "And that the only way to get back to any sort of equity value of cash flow is a very rapid recovery in the next couple of years, which we\u2019ll see. And so we \u2013 and, of course, we have finite capital, right? If I add $5 billion of cash laying around, that might be a little bit different than the hundreds of millions that I have now.",

And I guess, the question is, is that \u2013 are there scenarios where that\u2019s enough? And kind of what happens if you enter into a forbearance agreement now for six months, and then six months from now, you\u2019re not any closer to where you need to be?"

            "Yes. That\u2019s the fundamental question, Chris. I mean, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been struggling with since the beginning. And that\u2019s why when we first went to our lenders in March or April, we foresaw that fundamental issue and the first kind of ask, or the first discussions that we had with many of our lenders was a much more substantive term to it, because you\u2019re right.",
            "The \u2013 these forbearance arrangements that we\u2019re signing by and large will likely not suffice to kind of quote get us through, which is why we\u2019ve been very focused on trying to avoid high fees, trying to avoid high cash outlays, avoiding additional guarantees, and these sorts of things, because we might be willing to do some of that, to the extent that, there was more runway and we felt confident that there was a \u2013 not a guaranteed path, but a highly competent path that it would suffice.",
            "But at the same time, we want to not have our loans in default and be able to know that we\u2019re in good standing with our lenders. And so that\u2019s the tension. So, I mean, to the extent that, those agreements that we haven\u2019t yet signed up, I mean, that\u2019s, you kind of hit the nail on the head on kind of what\u2019s the fundamental issue is the amount of either capital or guarantees or fees that the servicers and lenders are trying to work or proposing to us are ones that aren\u2019t, in our opinion, justified given the short runway of forbearance.",
            "And so anyways, that\u2019s the next discussion. And I think we\u2019re working with the lenders that we\u2019ve gotten thus far. I mean, I think, we\u2019ve got good discussions and dialogues. And I think they see the same numbers that we\u2019re seeing.",
            "And so they think they understand that and I think there\u2019s a good number of them that as soon as we\u2019re getting 1-for-10. We likely will be starting on discussions [Technical Difficulty] until we have a real sense for what this every look like and have confidence in it.",
            "So that\u2019s the kind of the situation that, that we have to deal with. I wish there was an easy way to solve it. But until lenders are at a state willing to consider longer-term, either restructures or solutions, it\u2019s just a [Technical Difficulty] which we\u2019ll be in for a while."

I mean, is it a different conversation for a hotel that has maybe a lot of underlying \u2013 theoretical underlying asset value versus one that doesn\u2019t or one that\u2019s generating a peak was generating a lot of EBITDA versus a little EBITDA? Are \u2013 is there anyway to kind of bucket those? Or do you think that the conversations are all kind of all over the map?"

         "Remarks": [
            "That\u2019s a good question. Frankly, I don\u2019t think the conversations by and large that we\u2019ve had have almost been focused on the \u2013 it\u2019s almost like focused on the asset, right? You would kind of think that it would be, oh, this is an asset that you \u2013 there\u2019s confidence that there\u2019s equity value today. And here\u2019s confidence that there\u2019s not. And so that frames how aggressive or not aggressive a servicer or lender or we are.",
            "And honestly, that really hasn\u2019t been the case. The situation and the dynamic that we\u2019re seeing really is more, who is servicer? Who is the lender? Because by and large, the balance sheet lenders have been reasonable. We haven\u2019t gotten everything we\u2019ve wanted. We have to give them some things. But by and large, they\u2019ve been better to deal with. And then even the CMBS servicers, there has been a pretty wide gap of those that are, say, more reasonable and those who are materially less so.",
            "And I think that \u2013 what we\u2019ve seen thus far is the point of pressure intention is not the LTV or the coverage of the loan. The issue is whether or not there\u2019s mezzanine debt above that, that senior. Because what our experience thus far has been is that, I don\u2019t think these senior lenders see the bondholders to see the special services at CMBS are looking to aggressively foreclose. But what they are doing is putting pressure on mezzanine lenders to do something.",
            "So there\u2019s lots of threats of foreclosing on NIM of default interest of other bad things. And frankly, I think, kind of the servicers that are thinking smartly longer-term about the health of their own industry and the health of their own business are ones that are being a little bit more flexible with the mezz lenders, because the mezz lenders, by and large, are \u2013 see the same numbers that we do and realize that stepping into an asset at this moment is probably a difficult idea, given the potential negative cash flows and everything else coming off these properties. It doesn\u2019t really make sense for anybody to aggressively try to take over assets.",
            "One, there\u2019s the morally questionable aspect of doing that in the middle of a pandemic, but it is what it is. But they \u2013 no one, I think, really wants to do that unless their hands are forced. And so I think, in many cases, the situations that we\u2019ve been in, where mezz lenders have started take steps, I think, by and large, it\u2019s because their hands are being forced by senior servicers that are just trying to get some movement.",
            "So it\u2019s been interesting, because we do have a decent number of CMBS loans that don\u2019t have any mezz loan in. And by and large, those conversations are moving along, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a ton of pressure or lots of threats. And so it\u2019s been more about who is in the capital stack and who is a servicer as opposed to the underlying collateral. It\u2019s been my experience thus far."

            "Okay. Very helpful color. Maybe one question for probably Jeremy. I know you mentioned almost all your hotels are back open. I \u2013 and I understand break-even occupancy is certainly a lot lower than it was six, nine months ago. But is the decision to reopen doesn\u2019t even \u2013 does the hotel have the kind of the EBITDA positive or is it more of a case of you\u2019re losing less EBITDA by being opened and you\u2019re by being closed?"

But the decision on whether or not to reopen a hotel is not whether or not the hotel itself break-even. It\u2019s just \u2013 is it to lose less cash flow than to keep it closed.",
            "I mean, having a hotel and having it closed, there\u2019s no way around having negative cash flow, because you\u2019ve got property taxes, you\u2019ve got insurance, you\u2019ve got management teams that even if they\u2019ve reduced their salaries and their hours and their \u2013 the furloughs, it still cost money to own a hotel that is shutdown.",
            "And so it\u2019s all a break-even model from the perspective of losing mezz. And that\u2019s how we make a decision on window to reopen. And there\u2019s a lot of analysis that goes into it. We\u2019ve got a pretty good insight in all the different markets that we operate in, pretty good inside of what other properties in the markets are operating and what rate and potential occupancy would be.",
            "So I feel like we\u2019ve got a pretty good pulse and level of accuracy on what the right decision is on whether or not opening a hotel or keeping it closed. And as we\u2019ve mentioned\u2026"

Yes, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019ve always had the position of not giving guidance and that was in times where there was probably a lot more \u2013 what we thought was a lot more certainty, obviously, we\u2019re wrong. In February, when we thought there was certainly going forward or January of this year, and then a global pandemic it. But I can\u2019t really comment on any guidance.",
            "But I can give you kind of what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the markets and segments. And certainly, I think, our portfolio does help a little bit of trust, given that it\u2019s pretty well diversified in terms of top 25 markets and then hotels outside the top 25 markets got a good level diversity of extended stay and select service and full service assets. And we don\u2019t really have a lot of exposure on what you would call big box group pass hotels.",
            "There\u2019s just a few of them that we have that do a decent amount of group business. But by and large, most of our hotels are either leisure, transient or business transient. And what we\u2019ve seen, as I mentioned, is that every single week \u2013 week-over-week, the trend has gotten better. We\u2019ve seen a little bit of a slowdown, just because of that second wave.",
            "But if you look at April, our April results were down 93% RevPAR, May was down 89%, and then June was down 82%. So that went 93%, 89%, 82%. And so in July, I would expect it, it would be in the somewhere in the 70% range. And then the question is, to your point on looking into Q3 and Q4, how does that change?",
            "And it\u2019s hard for us to say, I mean, unfortunately, typically, in a \u2013 in the good times, our average booking window was three weeks. And today, it\u2019s probably three days. So there\u2019s just not a lot of clarity. But what I can tell you is that, even our internal forecasts that we\u2019ve had when we\u2019ve been putting together our models and cash positions and what we thought was going to happen.",
            "We\u2019ve always exceeded that. We\u2019ve always been higher than what we thought it was going to be. And I think that trend will probably continue. So we\u2019re assuming the worst, we\u2019re prepared for the worst. And fortunately, we\u2019re seeing a little bit better than what we\u2019re preparing our teams for.",
            "So I think eventually, in \u2013 people want to travel. I think, you\u2019ll see travel resume, people are resilient, and we\u2019re starting to see that, as I mentioned, certainly in July and a little bit in August as well. And so I would expect it, you\u2019ll see sequential growth month-over-month, week-over-week. There might be a few patterns where maybe it flattens out for a little bit, but we\u2019re talking weeks, not months, and certainly not years. That helps."

And then we don\u2019t always know if their business transit versus leisure just because it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s hard to know why someone is staying in your hotel and we don\u2019t interrogate them to know why they\u2019re staying in our hotel.",
            "But I would say that, certainly during the summer months, we do have a higher level of leisure travel in Q3, Q4 will be more business-oriented. But I don\u2019t know that I can comment on what the historical mixture pattern is for the portfolio. But what we are seeing a little bit, which is for areas where folks are doing home-school that they\u2019re taking advantage of traveling maybe to different locations with their families. And I think you might see that in Q3 and Q4, where folks are typically used to be in the offices, and they may be working somewhere else in a different location. And that may feel some leisure-related business, it\u2019s not necessarily business transient."

But I don\u2019t know if you \u2013 if I may have missed if you put any numbers on that or range of \u2013 and I realize it\u2019ll be different by your individual property level. But is there a range we should think about as kind of a \u2013 an overall average where it\u2019s break-even percent at the property level? And then I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s break-even percent sort of corporate-wide? Thanks."

So I think what we talked about in the last earnings call was something in the range of \u2013 for limited service properties kind of their property break-even was somewhere between 25% and 35% occupancy And that for the full service hotels, it was, by and large, kind of 35% to 45% occupancy.",
            "Some individual assets that are maybe in some higher wage markets could be a little bit higher than that, maybe closer to 50% or so. And then you probably need to add somewhere around other 10 points or so to kind of get to a total corporate level break-even."
