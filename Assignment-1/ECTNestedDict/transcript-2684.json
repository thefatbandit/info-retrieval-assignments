         "Thank you. Thank you, Denny, and welcome, everyone. In the second quarter, we saw sales growth across all market segments. Recall that a core strategy for UDENYCA is to pursue growth in all segments equally, balancing our efforts across them.",
         "For Q2, there was a favorable shift in unit demand to the clinic business, whereas last quarter in Q1, we reported that we sold more units on a relative basis to the 340B hospital segment. Additionally, we have sufficient supply to meet any current and future demand levels across all segments. Because UDENYCA is a made-in-America product, we are able to ensure continuity of supply as we\u2019re not reliant on a global supply chain. We continue to be thoughtful in our approaches to pricing and contracting, our dual objectives being relative ASP stability and profitability optimization. The reason our commercial organization has demonstrated such aptitude and resilience in the face of COVID is our deep proficiency in strategic planning and execution.",
         "As Denny has said before, the key to being successful in the biosimilar business is to be a biosimilar company. As the only U.S. pure-play biosimilar company, we believe that we have a unique perspective on how to optimize a biosimilar business.",
         "First, it\u2019s by leveraging a deep understanding of the market by offering a customer-centric value proposition that addresses their expectations and needs. Second is through serial [ph] organizational execution delivering this value to the market on a segment-by-segment basis. And third is by providing branded benefits with [technical difficulty] with biosimilar value with quality supply and rational contracting. Knowing the needs of our customers then responding with a meaningful approach, is a core tenet of our branding choice without compromise. Our services are embodied in a unique program called Coherus Complete. Let me offer a small example of one of them, our Co-Pay assistance program.",
         "Our approach to Co-Pay assistance provides immediate help to patients with out-of-pocket costs. This financial assistance has become a much appreciated component of our services for patients and providers who need it most during these challenging times. It is because of services like this as part of a comprehensive branded approach to the biosimilars that we have had the best pharmaceutical launch in 2019 based on IQVIA sales data.",
         "The success of the UDENYCA launch was recently recognized by the Healthcare Distribution Alliance who awarded Coherus The Diana Award for the category of Best New Product Introduction in the Biotechnology Pharmaceutical Products sector in 2019. In other recognition, Premier, a long time GPO leader in the hospital segment, honored Coherus as a winner of the annual Horizon Award. This award recognizes suppliers that consistently provide support at the highest levels of partnership, customer service, value creation, clinical excellence and commitment to lower costs. We are all very proud of these achievements and thank the HDA and Premier for these awards. We are confident that we will be well prepared to replicate the success with future launches of our pipeline products in ophthalmology and immunology. Back to you, Denny."

      "David Arrington": [
         "Thank you, Nora, and good afternoon, everyone. After close of market today, we issued a press release on our second quarter financial results. This release can be found on the Coherus Biosciences website. Joining me for today\u2019s call will be Denny Lanfear, Coherus\u2019 CEO; Dr. Jean Viret, Chief Financial Officer; Thomas Fitzpatrick, Chief Legal Officer; and Chris Thompson, Executive Vice President, Sales.",
         "Before we begin our formal remarks, I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including risks and uncertainties related to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Coherus\u2019 business and results of operations. In addition, other forward-looking statements, such as our plans and expectations regarding our ongoing commercialization of UDENYCA, product candidate pipeline, product development plans, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could use actual results to differ from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC filings.",
         "Please also note that the non-GAAP financial measures included in our press release should be used to help you understand Coherus\u2019 business performance and should not be a substitute for your review of our GAAP financial measures. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are also provided in the earnings press release.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Denny."
      ],
      "Denny Lanfear": [
         "Thank you, David.",
         "Good afternoon, everyone. On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll first review for you our results for the second quarter of 2020. And in doing so, provide you with some context with respect to COVID considerations, and how our strategies, competencies and capabilities allowed us to successfully navigate the market uncertainty. We\u2019ll then update for you our pipeline development as we advance our efforts to become a multiproduct growth company, addressing $30 billion in market opportunity over our five-year planning horizon. We\u2019ll recap for you our strategy to leverage our demonstrated commercial strengths into the ophthalmology and immunology therapeutic markets. Lastly, we will provide some color on how we see the remainder of 2020 developing with respect to our oncology and pegfilgrastim markets and provide financial insights on our cash use over the short-term planning period.",
         "With us today, we have Chris Thompson, our Executive VP of Sales, who will provide our commercial update and color; and Jean Viret, our CFO, who will provide our financial updates.",
         "Let me start with our top line Q2 2020 financial results. We are pleased to report that net product revenue for the quarter was $136 million, exceeding our expectations. Earnings were $0.70 per share, and non-GAAP earnings were $0.81 per share, both on a diluted basis. We increased our cash, cash equivalents and investments to $456 million.",
         "For the quarter, our commercial strategy and strong execution, successfully mitigated COVID\u2019s potential impact on unit sales. And after a brief pause at the beginning of the crisis in March and April, market share growth has now resumed. We believe the strong performance this quarter further validates the commercial capability, which enabled us to deliver such strong launch results last year and gives us high confidence that we will do so very well commercially with our ophthalmology and immunology product candidates. I want to thank the entire Coherus team for their very fruitful efforts in a tough market environment.",
         "Now with respect to our second quarter results, I would remind you that on our last call, we made three predictive statements as we actively managed risk with respect to COVID. First, we observed that there was a COVID-driven delay for patient referrals for oncology treatment which could persist through the second quarter and beyond. We also reported and observed an uptick in the use of Neulasta Onpro in certain COVID hotspot regions, and we projected that it would be a transient, based on feedback from customers in those regions. Lastly, we shared that we believed UDENYCA demand and would continue to grow through 2020 as cancer patients and providers continued to benefit from the value provided by UDENYCA.",
         "So let me review the data and how these dynamics played out in the pegfilgrastim market for Q2. The oncology market in general and the pegfilgrastim market in particular, proved to be very resilient as providers and hospitals found ways to identify new patients and treat patients already diagnosed. Recent IQVIA data has shown a strong rebound with new patients. New patient diagnoses increased to 96% of baseline by the end of June, back up from a mid-COVID nator [ph] of about 70%. Pegfilgrastim demand is growing, and we believe the new NCCN ASCO guidelines have had a positive, supportive impact from existing patients, as we anticipated on our last call. The pegfilgrastim market has remained strong, with quarter-over-quarter unit growth in the low single digits, consistent with previous quarters. Additionally, market data suggests Neulasta\u2019s overall shares declining again as hospitals have adapted to the COVID environment. We have seen a modest ASP decline in the market, reflecting our price discipline.",
         "Let me address the reasons we believe the pegfilgrastim market has proven to be resilient in the second quarter, and specifically the two dynamics at play here. First, cancers typically grow very fast, and treatment delay is dangerous to patients. Therefore, cancer patients requiring chemotherapy are now seeking treatment. Referrals are stabilizing to normal levels across most regions. Second, providers are adjusting to the needs of oncology patients through new measures and service delivery paradigms that ensure continuity of their operations and patient safety. The dynamic is relatively straightforward. Patients depend on cancer care for their lives and health care providers are committed to providing this essential care. The result for the second quarter in the face of COVID was less moderation in demand and pegfilgrastim usage than some had anticipated, and a clear demonstration of the robustness of the market, COVID notwithstanding.",
         "Now let me turn the call over to Chris Thompson, who will make a few comments about our commercial performance. Chris?",
         "Thank you, Chris. Now let me turn to our long-term growth and discuss the company\u2019s internally developed pipeline and partnered products. I\u2019m pleased to report that we have made significant progress across our product pipeline and in support of our strategy to have six FDA-approved biosimilars on the market by the end of 2025.",
         "With respect to our ophthalmology franchise, I\u2019ll remind you that we have two biosimilars in the pipeline, one for Lucentis, in-licensed from Bioeq in the fourth quarter of 2019; and one for Eylea, our fully owned and internally developed CHS-2020 product candidate. Regarding the Lucentis biosimilar, our partner, Bioeq, is proceeding with the FDA-required activities to resubmit the BLA in the fourth quarter of this year. We are pleased with the inflammation safety of this new biosimilar Lucentis. In our trial, both the control arm and biosimilar arm were comparable to each other. And with very low inflammation rates, performed meaningfully better than the original Phase III Lucentis trial.",
         "With respect to CHS-2020, our clinical manufacturing and other development efforts are on schedule to enable a Phase III clinical start in 2021. We expect this study to support both U.S. and European approval and further expect to initiate activities to identify a potential European partner in the second half of this year.",
         "With respect to the commercial opportunity for these products, I would note that the ophthalmology market represents an additional $6 billion in market opportunity for the company, which can be efficiently accessed with an incremental commercial investment. Furthermore, ophthalmology shares similar market dynamics to oncology where we have demonstrated success. Just like the U.S. biologics oncology market, the U.S. biologics ophthalmology market is a buy-and-bill Medicare Part B segment, but with a higher Medicare patient population.",
         "This market also comprises a highly concentrated prescriber base, consisting of about 450 accounts, representing about 80% of business volume. Thus, we believe that our successful launch of UDENYCA and our strong expertise in areas of market access and contracting positions us favorably for commercial success we\u2019re up \u2013 with our ophthalmology biosimilars. We expect Coherus to have a significant role then in biosimilar market formation.",
         "Now let me make a few comments about CHS-1420, our internally developed biosimilar candidate to HUMIRA that addresses an $18 billion market. We expect this to be a competitive environment, which is a positive for us as we have a demonstrated proficiency in executing in highly competitive environments. There is substantial market share to be taken from the innovator, and we expect payers to play a key role in product selection decisions. And they will be highly receptive to competitive overtures from biosimilars. We are currently honing our commercial strategies to address value drivers for the various segments and value chain constituents. We expect to file the BLA in the fourth quarter of this year, and we are confident in our ability to outperform after our projected July 2023 product launch.",
         "Lastly, with respect to oncology, our Avastin biosimilar in-licensed from Innovent Biologics. We continue productive engagement with Innovent into advance towards a BLA filing. Activities include FDA-required interaction supporting the initiation of a three-way PK study using the Innovent\u2019s Avastin from the United States and China compared to Innovent\u2019s Avastin biosimilar.",
         "Now I\u2019ll let the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jean Viret, summarize our second quarter financials. Jean?",
         "Thank you, Jean. Let me make a few points. The pegfilgrastim market has proven to be robust. And looking ahead to Q3 and year-end, while we expect that there will be local effects from COVID resurgences, we believe the overall market will remain resilient due to hospitals and clinics adapting to the treatment environment.",
         "Local and time-limited disruptions aside, the overall market is growing in terms of units, bolstered by the new NCCN ASCO guidance. The innovator still has 70% share. And despite competitive activity increasing, we believe there is room to grow market share in a price-responsible way.",
         "With both our 2019 launch and our Q2 2020 performance, our commercial team has demonstrated themselves to be highly capable of delivering strong results in challenging environments. Thus, we expect continued success in the second half of the year, although the market conditions with COVID remain fluid.",
         "Thanks to UDENYCA\u2019s success, we are in a strong financial position to support our pipeline growth trajectory with additional biosimilar launches expected in oncology, ophthalmology and immunology over the next few years. We believe these therapeutic areas will leverage Coherus\u2019 strengths, including our award-winning commercial infrastructure, increasing access for patients, savings to the health care system, while continuing to generate growth and shareholder value over the long-term.",
         "Operator, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions."
      ],
      "Jean Viret": [
         "Thank you, Denny, and welcome, everybody. I will now review the main financial results for the second quarter of 2020.",
         "Net product revenue was $136 million with non-GAAP net income of $68 million and diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81. Net product revenue included a $13 million favorable revision of our payer rebate estimate recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Net revenue for second quarter of 2019 was $83 million with a non-GAAP net income of $32 million and diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43.",
         "Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were $26 million compared to $19 million for the same period in 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were $34 million compared to $36 million for the same period in 2019 when we were in the second quarter of our UDENYCA launch. We anticipate that R&D and SG&A expenses combined together will range between $285 million and $310 million for the full year fiscal year 2020, excluding upfront or milestone payments from any potential new collaborations.",
         "For the second half of the year, we are projecting relative SG&A expense stability while R&D expense will increase as we file and prosecute the CHS-1420 HUMIRA biosimilar BLA, scale up the manufacturing to meet the launch demand and initiate the Phase III programs for CHS-2020, our Eylea biosimilar.",
         "We started our second quarter with $193 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments and ended the quarter with $456 million. The $263 million increase is primarily due to generating $60 million in net cash from operating activities and receiving $223 million in net proceeds from issuing convertible debt notes, offset by purchasing $18 million in cap calls options related to these convertible notes.",
         "Now back to you, Denny."

I think, Denny, you mentioned there was a sort of relative shift to the clinics this quarter compared to last quarter where you saw sort of a relative shift to 340B segment.",
            "Just curious if you can talk about what specifically is driving that dynamic. Or is it just some seasonality? And maybe how we think about those dynamics going forward?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks for the question, Mike. I think that the \u2013 each segment has a tendency to ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter, as we described earlier. We also described that we tend to push on segments that are lagging behind a bit. For Q1, we had a little more in the 340B segment. The clinics came back slightly in Q2. But overall, this is just natural course of business, so I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much. Going forward, we expect things to remain stable throughout the rest of the year."

Maybe have you seen any changes from Sandoz more recently? And then you\u2019ve also got Pfizer in the mix now. So any thoughts on what you\u2019re seeing from Pfizer? Or how to think about competition in the back half of the year?"

So we haven\u2019t seen a lot of activity by them in the marketplace. But we fully expect that they\u2019ll be out there. And as it relates to Sandoz, we\u2019ve seen very little uptake with them. But they do have a code. So we\u2019re ready for the competition. Pfizer, their codes are yet to come. So it will probably be a little bit of time before we start to see activity from them."

But I think you said that for your biosimilar Lucentis, you\u2019re seeing inflammation rates that are in line with the Phase III \u2013 original Phase III Lucentis program. It\u2019s my understanding that, over the years, they\u2019ve refined the formulation and they have the inflammation rates now under 1% in all the clinical studies.",

But can you just talk about what you all are doing to help them \u2013 Bioeq along? I know the experience that you all have and kind of working through sometimes difficult situations.

In particular, we have experienced in manufacturing Lucentis biosimilars. So there\u2019s been robust engagement on a weekly basis. There\u2019s strategic meetings with higher levels of management, slightly less frequently. I\u2019m on several of those meetings from time to time, myself. We monitor that very closely.",

Could you please comment on the growth of UDENYCA? If there was a volume growth in line with the market there? And also, like we saw that for Neulasta Onpro, there was a market share gain.

I think what\u2019s important in terms of the takeaway here is that we indicated on the Q1 call that Onpro uptick would be transitory and was subject to the COVID first wave and would wash through the market. That\u2019s what we saw. As COVID went through and people became more adept at dealing with COVID, we saw Onpro share recede, I think it\u2019s down from 60% down to around 56%, if I\u2019m correct.",

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. So can you comment on the UDENYCA per se? I mean year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter, if you are still gaining share? Or for now, it is just pandemic which is probably impacting it."

      "24": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, keep in mind that \u2013 sure, happy to do so. Keep in mind that we ended the year about 20% market share as we guided. We went up to about 22% to 23% in the February March timeframe pre-COVID. We had a very, very strong first part of the year. And then as we went into COVID, we dipped down, went down, I think, even south of 20%, maybe I saw 19% during that period of time. We\u2019ve now successfully reversed that. Our exit share of Q2 was 22%, which I think is quite good. We\u2019re very happy with that performance. And our observation here, of course, the market has just become more adept in dealing with COVID.",
            "We \u2013 I would say we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow share. However, there\u2019s some short-term uncertainty in the face of competition and some other things including COVID for the second half.

I really wanted to just touch base if you can on how you\u2019re thinking about deploying capital here for the next wave of biosimilars, which seems like it\u2019s pretty heavily skewed to the oncology side of the arena. And I know in the past, you guys have said you feel like you\u2019re pretty well-stocked to go after the ocular or the ophthalmology opportunity. But thinking kind of longer term, your thoughts regarding internal R&D investment versus external efforts to go after the next wave of biosimilars, which would probably be the 2025 or 2030 market entry type of opportunities?"

            "Great question. Let me take that therapeutic area by therapeutic area. First of all, with respect to immunology and inflammation and HUMIRA, we don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s required to have an additional product added there. So, we intend to launch HUMIRA and have that to be our sole inflammation product at this time. Not to say that we wouldn\u2019t focus on an additional product, if it came by. But we don\u2019t have plans to deploy capital as you as you questioned, in that particular direction.",
            "With respect to ophthalmology, having the two primary VEGFs, I think is what you want to do if I didn\u2019t have them both. And only had one, and I would probably be telling you that I would be obtaining the other. But I don\u2019t see further additions to the ophthalmology portfolio in terms of, for example, innovative products or other biosimilars.",

We focus on delivering health care savings to the system and increasing access to patients. And if you look across oncology and immuno-oncology, I think that there is ample opportunities to do that. So you\u2019ll probably see us continue to focus in oncology with respect to our new product efforts and capital deployment. That being said, keep in mind that we are spending second half of this year, next year on certain exercises for 1420, the HUMIRA biosimilar, with respect to manufacturing. And we\u2019re also focusing on the Phase III for Eylea, CHS-2020, which will certainly consume capital between now and 2025. Does that help?"

Who knows what will come about or if it\u2019s just a more near-term, politicized type of dynamic? But as you think about shopping for external assets in the IO space, is that crossing your radar in terms of having something that\u2019s developed locally to be able to supply the U.S. market, which is your focus?"

Do you expect price to remain relatively stable as we think about market dynamics? I\u2019m just kind of thinking about Sandoz now with their code, Mylan kind of relaunching. Should we think about a little bit of a step down in price? Or do you think we can kind of maintain where we are?",

            "Great. Good questions, Chris. Let me take the first question first. With respect to price, it\u2019s difficult for us to predict the pricing behavior of competitors who have not yet acted. So we haven\u2019t seen Pfizer come in and take action or take share. They don\u2019t have a code or really set any price.",
            "We\u2019ve seen Sandoz in the market. They do have a code, but we haven\u2019t seen any sort of market share taken by Sandoz. So, we\u2019re a bit uncertain of their pricing strategies and so on. Overall, though, I think it\u2019s fair to say that as more competitors come into the market, there will be more of an emphasis on very \u2013 on price, certainly. However, I would also point out, though, that it is not simply a matter of price in these markets, right? We have the highest biosimilar price, yet we have the largest biosimilar market share. It\u2019s important to deliver value to these markets. They are not primarily an only price-driven, right?",
            "And this leads then to your second question with respect to Avastin. We expect to deliver substantial value to the Avastin market when we launch. We expect to do well there. I think as a biosimilar company, we are uniquely focused on delivering value that market participants expect, and we\u2019ve successfully done that. We\u2019ve done that with our launch, we\u2019ve done that in Q2 in the face of COVID, and we\u2019re going to do that with our future products also.",
            "So, I would just disabuse the notion that somehow price is the only thing that matters. It\u2019s certainly important, it\u2019s necessary, it\u2019s required. But our track record speaks to our ability to understand the needs of the market, the needs of our customer base and deliver holistic value. And that is why we have been successful."

I think it\u2019s going to be something in the order of $25 billion in the U.S. in 2025 going forward. So if you look at just that segment and you look at delivering potential value and access to patients, I think that it fits inside that box. As you point out though, the biosimilar PD-1s arrived somewhat later this decade, late 2028-ish, 2029-ish. So, I think that you have to be fairly sophisticated and nuanced if you were to develop a PD-1 strategy.",

To a fair degree, pricing is something that your competitors have a bit to say about. So that has to be considered. So overall, price and share will give you sales. We\u2019re reticent to project sales not knowing the behavior of the competitors with respect to pricing. But as we indicated, we feel that we can continue to come out of Q2 and perform as we have. I think we\u2019re doing very well in the face of COVID and existing competition and continue some share growth. But how that \u2013 how the translates to revenues for 2020 is another issue. I would like to be able to give you more color and a bigger commitment with respect to share growth across 2020. But given COVID, that\u2019s a little tough to do.

With respect to ophthalmology, you have products there that are given in very, very small doses relatively infrequently, either once a month or twice a month. That means the COGS is very low. As I indicated a few minutes ago, the boots on the ground for ophthalmology is marginal and incremental, maybe 25 folks with significant leveraging internally.",

With respect to inflammation and 1420, we expect to be able to deliver substantial volumes to that market to be extraordinarily competitive in terms of cost. I think that\u2019s very attractive also in terms of margins and COGS. I think that all of these markets in the U.S. with biosimilars are proving to be very attractive with respect to margins.

Over the next five years, we anticipate our addressable market will grow $4 billion to about $10 billion in 2022, and again, a further $30 billion by 2023.",

Our strong UDENYCA results reflect our commercial competency in the face of market challenges. We are confident in our ability to replicate the success with our subsequent commercial launches. We look forward to seeing you all again on our next call in November. Thank you."
