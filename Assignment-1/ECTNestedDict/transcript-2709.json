         "Arvind, can we start?",

         "As you would have already seen that this has been a rather subdued quarter for us. You will get to hear reasons and our programs going forward. But primary driver for this performance has been gross product mix and some of the COVID related the impact in terms of cost, which may be one-time and also impact on sales in many of our geographies. But certainly we have our homework cut out for ourselves.",
         "Just to walk you through the details of the prudential numbers, I will request Ramesh to do that for me. And then the floor will be open for Q&A. Thank you and over to Ramesh.",

And there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the opening remarks. Please note that this conference is being recorded. We will start in next two minutes. Thank you."

      "Ramesh Swaminathan": [
         "Thank you, Dr. Sharman. And dear friends, welcome to our Q1 FY '21 results webinar. This is the first time we are conducting the results discussion through an online digital platform. And I believe that we find this suitable, we'll continue with this format in the subsequent quarters as well. And let me take you through the key aspects of our Q1 performance.",
         "We\u2019ve guided for a tough quarter, because we had felt the tremors of the same, the impact of COVID in May itself. We felt that the impact of market disruption could be across the entire -- all the regions, including two of our largest markets, India and the U.S. However, our API business has outperform this quarter at 3,468 crores gross we were lower than the previous quarter by 8.5% and lower than previous year by 9.1%.",
         "The U.S business has performed steadily always, as you would know, at $180 million to $190 million the whole of last year. We actually saw this reaching $212 million the last quarter. However, the U.S sales declined by 26% sequentially to $157 million and declined by 28% as compared to the previous year. This was because of demand contraction by 12% versus the previous quarter and over 6% vis-\u00e0-vis with the previous year.",
         "The seasonality factor also played and therefore we saw loss of sales on oseltamivir, azithromycin and the cephalosporins business. And there's of course the impact of metformin as well. India, one region that we\u2019ve consistently performed over several quarters. There was of course the COVID impact, and the India region branded formulations so a degrowth of 6% year-on-year, especially for acute products.",
         "As per Equa, Lupin's growth was -- in Q1 was a negative 1.4%, whilst for the IPM, it was 4.9%. In June, there was some revival of demand, but there was disruption again in July, but we do expect Q2 to be much better than Q1 as demand picks up again from August onwards. As I said before, API sales showed significant growth of 24.5% sequentially, the strong positive momentum on demand as well as pricing. We expect a strong double-digit growth year-on-year to continue.",
         "On the gross margins front, we did well to actually sustain it at 62.9%. And this, despite the fact there was sharp decline in U.S business, as I've stated before, it's also the impact of higher freight cost. But all the same, we have been able to maintain the margins, underlined improvements in our overall business.",
         "On the manpower front, we saw them actually increasing, but that actually is an aberration. Manpower cost increased this quarter on account of one-time expense in terms of specialty restructuring in the U.S and COVID linked incentives. However, we do believe from Q2 onwards, we would expect the recurring benefits due to specialty restructuring to be called up and we expect the overall absolute number to be lower than Q4.",
         "Overall on the manufacturing other expenses, including the freight, so the freight element of course is captured in terms of the gross margins itself. The expenses were higher, but there was significant -- close to about 100 crores, but there was significant fall in manufacturing expenses in terms of travel -- manufacturing other expenses in terms of travel, legal and consulting fees, sales promotion expenses, and the like.",
         "As you would recognize, this is obviously because it is not possible to call on doctors. So there was considerable savings on that. And of course, promotions don't -- didn't take place and so on. But it's not necessarily something that's wholly sustainable, but having said that it would be a endeavor and to take it -- take digital means and try to sustain it at levels, which are lower than ever in the past.",
         "As we normalize operations, we do expect some increase in the SG&A expenses, but the savings to some extent will certainly continue. On the EBITDA front, we're happy to report an operating EBITDA improvement of 1% over the last quarter. But we recognize this is without including ForEx and other income. And we are confident that this EBITDA trajectory will continue to improve in Q2 and beyond.",
         "I\u2019ve guided for close to about 19% to 20%, but I'd also add in caveat to recall that this is before taking into account the situation on account of COVID, we reevaluated the entire thing and we do believe that we should be able to close by at about 17% without of course the fact of ForEx or other income as we go forward.",
         "In terms of the outlook, we expect operating margins to improve as I just said. It is also because the fact that you would expect market share expansion of Levothyroxine. Return of Glumetza much before the end of 42, customers start their winter buys and they should help the products like azithromycin, cephalosporins and [indiscernible]. And of course, there's this much awaited launch of albuterol in September.",
         "In addition, we have also partnered for a few products and that we will be launching in the next couple of months. Aided by a tight control on manpower cost, SG&A expenses and rationalization of costs on the specialty front, we believe that we'll be in a position to kind of boost the margins.",
         "In terms of the ETR, which has always been a short point. It remains high this quarter, but we expect it to improve in H2, because the ramp up in sales and of course the specialty restructuring. For the full year, we believe that the ETR would be between 35% to 40%.",
         "With this, I would like to open the floor for discussions."

And a recent one we just learned about Strides, but if you look at the Levo market over the last five years and look at the new entrants, especially the small entrants into the market, it is not an easy product at all to ramp up. It really takes a combination of strong delivery from a supply chain standpoint, a position from a manufacturing standpoint that is different from a typical oral solid product. So while we see some additional competition, we still see a significant opportunity in Levo. And as I mentioned, we are well on our way to ramp it up."

If you look at -- you called out some qualitative color, but if you could help us understand the commentary around July being slower than June, and what are you seeing -- I know it's just the first week of August, but what gives you the confidence that we will start to ramp this business back again?"

            "Sure, Shyam. So obviously we saw some of the COVID related stocking in March, which continued into the first couple of weeks of April as well. And then the rest of April, May is where we saw a major reduction in footfalls into doctors, and therefore a subsequent reduction in demand as well. If you look at IQVR, you see that curve, especially the acute being deeply impacted, especially in April, May. And you see it -- you see the improvement in June. It wasn't that impacted on the chronic side. Very similarly for us as well, obviously May was bad. June we saw the increase, so we saw that we could open up. I think we went all the way up to close to 90% of our reps being back on detailing. We went to a call average on North of six as well. And then as you know, in July, there were a series of lockdowns across States which again, brought it down to probably 70% odd of reps moving and detailing. Obviously, July got impacted again because of that. August has started off much better and we see increase. Typically you would see that Q1 is actually a strong quarter for the India business and Q2 is actually weaker than Q1 usually. We actually -- are currently forecasting growth in Q2 over Q1, and August certainly seems to be shaping in the right direction."

I think the market is possibly forecasted to grow anywhere from 0.2% to 3% to 5% is what we see. But my personal feeling is we'll probably end up at 5% to 8% as a company."

Yes, on the Adpro, obviously, there's a significant reduction at this point of time, in terms of promotion to doctors and the like. So I think some of those savings which will not replicate are the ones which are related to the field staff. So when they're working from home, obviously there's allowances in the light that you save as well, which becomes a significant number. But obviously for the rest of the year, there's a lot of stuff, conferences, there's a lot of that stuff which should not happen, likelihood certainly international travel to conferences and the like would not happen either. So there would be savings, which should certainly happen in the course of the year. But if you go beyond COVID, I think this has really been a great opportunity for us to truly embrace digital. There is -- I think we've been in 3,200 CMEs to date. We have done 200 training sessions for our representatives. The numbers are huge, we've done 30,000 teleconsult calls every day. So there's a very large number of -- there's a very large embracement of all things digital at this point of time. I don't think it changes the market completely. Like I said, the footfall, the -- more than 90% of representatives have been back on the job. Our call average is somewhere between 6 to 7 per day. So there's a fair bit of the old, which is coming back as well. But I think this is a great opportunity to go beyond as well."

            "You hear me now? There's no echo. So as I was saying, Sameer, that we\u2019ve restructure our commercial infrastructure on the Solosec front this past quarter. And as Ramesh mentioned, we had a one-time impact based on that. As we were talking even in May that the doctor visits in the OBGYN offices, pretty much dropped off completely, were down 80%. And we saw scripts bottom out in April. Since April into May and June, we have seen a ramp up in scripts, 10% in May, 20% in June and continuing to see that for the most part in July as well. So we are seeing demand come back slowly, but it is coming back and leveraging also the recent wins with Express Scripts just in the last week, we had another major win, Cigna put Solosec in a preferred position. We're trying to drive prescription growth as much as we can. The team is just very focused on trying to be as nimble as possible, as doctor's offices open, get in front of the physicians as much as we can. I mean, as of now, it's just 10% of our targets, physician targets, doctor offices that are really open to face to face visits. So majority of the interaction is still virtual, but what is very heartening to see is that the virtual engagement is having an impact in script growth. We continue to work to drive that in the months to come. I hope that answered your question, Sameer."

And so, Nilesh, just on your comment -- picking on your comment in the press release, you talked about it being a pivotal year for complex generic launch this year or your asset -- key assets. So outside of Enbrel [indiscernible], is there anything else that you want to talk about? And also, it said that pivotal year for a momentum in compliance. So if you can update us on those four sides. Thank you."

            "I think you've captured the [technical difficulty]. Obviously, those are the big ones. So, we've been investing in inhalation for, I think the last six or seven years. This is the year that we start delivering. Obviously, albuterol approval and launch Tiotropium approval. So there are multiple milestones that we will hit on inhalation. There are other assets that are under development, filings as well. So it's a critical year from the inhalation perspective. On biosimilars, at this point of time, it is Etanercept from a launch perspective, which we intend to launch in this quarter in Europe. Obviously, by the end of the year, we expect to file our PEGG [ph] as well. So again, multiple milestones that that will be there. And then switching to the compliance, I think we've had a very solid first half. The inspections that we had in the first quarter were all positive in terms of outcome. And we had slated this out to be the year of completely earning back our rightful space on the compliance front. Obviously, with COVID and with the restrictions with FDA, not really being in a position to do audits. I think there's a bit of a limbo at this point on our OAI facilities. But I think the momentum is to continue and I think we are aligned with FDA and that everybody wants supply continuity, everybody wants for facilities that are compliant to be up and running. And I think, we're obviously working with the FDA. We've made a lot of progress in sites, obviously Somerset, which we\u2019ve already put up for inspection, but we've made a lot of progress at Goa, Pithampur to -- both of these are possibly in the next month going to be ready for re-inspection. And we are going to really work with FDA to see what would be the best way. I don't think there's a stated, remote virtual audit process. There is certainly a document review process. There is a mutual recognition process as well. We'll have to push the envelope and see what will be the best way to do it. But, again, from our own internal development, there's a lot of strength which has been built on the compliance trend and we certainly expect to take this to the finish line."

Even for the market, if you look at overall market and then for our specific products, we saw contraction quarter-over-quarter because of the buys in March.

If you can please stick with the guidance that what kind of a exit EBITDA margin are we looking at in 4Q.

So essentially the kind of products we bring to the market, the kind of cost realize -- cost -- how do you -- how much of cost incur in terms of conversion and the like, and of course the various expenses in terms of SG&A and so on. On the products front, there are quite a few products lined up, as you just spoke about, Cephalosporins ramp up, we are speaking about albuterol and the like. And of course the U.S business would bounce back in terms of volumes that you would see out there, the kind of value that you would see there. We are also been indulging in cost initiatives for quite some time now. We\u2019ve been working with the consultants for in terms of ALT vendor programs and the like. And the impact of it will certainly maybe felt much more in -- on the gross margin side as we go by. Apart from that, we also incur -- working on several other initiatives to bring down the cost on the -- below the gross margin line [indiscernible]. And of course on the R&D front, we do what it takes to kind of sustain the expenditure at the same levels or even lower as you go by. With all of this, we're fairly confident and at the beginning of the CR we said, we would guide to anything between 19% to 20% and [indiscernible] a little bit more than that. But then we also took a step back given the fact that there was this issue of the COVID and after having looked at that we believe that we should be in a position to look at least about 17% by the end of the year. The average, we would be able to get a 17%."

Some of it is actually disconnected to the fact that it's about time that we ramped up share in some of those fermentation, for example, right? So some of it where there is over dependence on intermediates. We're seeing an opportunity to be able to step up. I think we're going to have to work as an industry with the government in terms of tweaking the scheme, so that five years later, we actually genuinely able to say, this is what we did to reduce dependence. But other than that, I think it's an opportunity. I think, for the API business in general, for the sector, it's a great opportunity to earn back the space that we had, which we lost over the last 10 years whether it's intermediates, whether it's fermentation, whether it's API. And we -- I don't think we're going across the board, but there's several sets of products where we feel that making the right investment will make sense now."

From a near-term perspective, we really see this very focused around essential medicines related to COVID, very focused around government buys, and we get a very small percentage of the government business supplying out of India in any case, because there's a preference for local manufacturing. This order depending on how it's executed, could mandate or give a significant preference to local manufacturing. On the government front, which -- from our perspective, we see as an incremental opportunity. So -- and based on the conversations that we are having with the government, they are being very -- they are very cognizant of the role that India plays. In the U.S supply chain, they are very, very focused on drug pricing as we have seen in the other orders. And we as an industry have made them aware of the impact of manufacturing in the U.S versus India. The cost impact, they understand. There's incremental cost impact. So we do expect that this move towards manufacturing is going to be around areas of high national importance, which right now is COVID related products, anti-infectives and a couple of categories that the government has highlighted broadly. We will find out over the next couple of weeks and months how this transpires into actual products. But our expectation is that it's going to be essential medicines, more COVID related in the near-term, which will be an upside for us. Also the government business opportunity will be an upside for us."

So those costs are ongoing. They're actually lower with COVID because everything has been done only remotely. And we actually are now selectively re-examining. I think, if you go deeper into our compliance issues, one of the big areas was investigations. I think we've been able to now start inspiring confidence in our actions on the investigations front. And I think that gives us the opportunity on what is the best way to structure this, so that we take more of an internal lead rather than a third-party lead in that for some sites. In other sites where we feel that we still need to have that input we will do that. So I think we're looking at the scope of third-party work.

In Europe, we are looking at the potential of getting it into the U.S market and building on Solosec on the specialty front in the U.S. In the -- as we look at the next couple of years, we have a whole pipeline of these complex generic assets and these platforms playing out. I mean, after albuterol and Foster this year, we expect in the next year we will have, of course, the full year impact of albuterol plus we'll have other inhalation products. Brovana that we approved for, [indiscernible] that we expect to get approved for, Dulera that we have filed and then Spiriva in the following year. So the inhalation portfolio will play a material impact in the next couple of years. In the biosimilars front with Enbrel starting this year, full year impact next year plus pegfilgrastim coming into the market in fiscal year '23 when you start seeing impact of biosimilars in U.S. and Europe over the next two years. And then the injectable portfolio coming thereafter. So we really see this -- all of the investment that we have made on the complex genetic front, we are right at the inflection point to benefit from it in the next couple of years, driving top line growth hopefully on an annualized basis. But in a 5-year time frame, double-digit growth."

            "Thanks. Very comprehensive answer. A follow-up to that would be, so going forward, let's say, 7 to 10 years ahead, do we think of spending more on R&D from the current 10% of sales level to maybe making it up to 15% to 17%. And also, how do you see the margin trajectory with these products kicking in?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So actually, we believe that our R&D level is at a point from an absolute standpoint that we should be able to manage within over the years to come. So we are looking very hard at R&D investment. Obviously, we want to continue to build these -- our business based on the complex genetic assets, which are a big part of the R&D investment. And we hope to be able to maintain it at that 10% or hopefully with the revenue growth at below the 10% level. So definitely we keep working hard at that line. And likewise, as Ramesh mentioned earlier, the other lines, as we look at the EBITDA trajectory with the complex assets improving our overall gross margin and our efforts on the operational front, operational efficiencies that we've already got some benefit from in the past year, but material benefit we're expected to get a good size benefit this year, a little bit delayed due to COVID. We certainly will have that benefit fiscal year '22 onwards. Plus all our initiatives around manpower, cost containment, which you will see, like Ramesh said, Q2 onwards, our manpower costs will be below the Q4 level. We are very determined to keep it under control and make sure that we are getting the right productivity from the manpower standpoint. Likewise, on the SG&A front, we see potential for improvement. We've seen some savings just as a result of COVID and COVID related cost, travel and promotional costs. We'll see some ramp up, but we certainly see a real opportunity to bank savings on that front as well. So as we look at the impact of our portfolio and building up our revenues with the complex assets, biosimilars specialty, plus the strong control on the cost lines, in particular manpower SG&A and maintaining R&D at under 10% of net sales, we expect to get a EBITDA margin to the right level in the 20s."

We really don't see a switch of metformin into the products because the MDMA issue impacted multiple players in the marketplace. It didn't impact everybody. And we ourselves have been able to work around the MDMA issue. And that's why I have the confidence of getting back into the market in Q2. So we really -- the market has been supplied in the near-term by players that did not have an MDMA issue. So we don't see the market really changing in any material manner."

Have you given specifics, like a little bit of color on the quantum of Glumetza, loss of sales apart from the seasonality and the COVID related you talked about, but any color on the size in Tamiflu and Glumetza?",

But roughly what we said, of the $50 million drop, Prakash, more than 50% was flu products, Tamiflu, Azithromycin, SES. And the balance was a combination of metformin and the demand contraction due to the buying of the pre-buying in March. So we expect in the next two quarters, in Q2, things will certainly improve. As we are looking at demand per se and the flu season products also coming back into the market, hopefully before the end of the quarter, the winter buys, and albuterol some impact in Q2. But we certainly see Q3 onwards the ability to get back to that. We were doing a $180 million to $190 million pre-COVID -- get to that level and beyond Q3 onwards."

If you look at the shares right now, the ProAir generics are doing pretty well. Also, the Proventil, overall has taken a little more of the market, really at the cost of GSK, the Ventolin product and it's AG. So we see ProAir as very -- giving us access to the entire market from interchangeability standpoint."

Maybe [technical difficulty] say that albuterol authorized generics are being supplied from the branded company, so the costs are quite different from yours. And is there any other competitive difference between having a pure generic versus authorized generic as a competitor?"

To your first point, the authorized generics are from high cost facilities, primarily in the U.S. In fact, even the largest generic the ProAir generic from Perrigo is from Catalent, which is a U.S facility. So high cost facility. I believe that both our self and Cipla have a real advantage with the product out of India. And I think the fact that we have a couple of U.S. manufacturers in the mix really helps us keep that pricing stable as we look at the market evolution over the next couple of years. Sameer, can you repeat your second question?"
