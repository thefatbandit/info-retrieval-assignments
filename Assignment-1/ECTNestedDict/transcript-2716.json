         "Thank you. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss first quarter '21 results. Steve will cover financial details with you in a minute, but let me first give you my perspectives on the quarter.",
         "I'll start by stating that I'm pleased with the direction I am seeing in the business. Our team has been working hard both to pursue new business and work our way through some difficult technical challenges on previous programs. We're starting to see the results from these efforts.",
         "FEI has a long history of providing products that go into space. And as the U.S. increases its focus there, FEI is well positioned to service that market. Building electronics that have to operate reliably and effectively in that environment is very difficult. FEI has the benefit of over 50 years of experience with our systems operating in space, and that is a knowledge base that we leverage to ensure better, more reliable products. That's an invaluable FEI asset and one which fosters customer confidence in us as is reflected by the increasing number of awards for precision time and Frequency products for satellite applications. I believe we will see continuing growth in this arena as space becomes an increasingly more important domain to the U.S. Military, and that bodes very well for FEI.",
         "Not wanting to slide our terrestrial market, I'm also pleased with recent awards for precision oscillators that will go into various U.S. military airborne platforms, one of which we announced this afternoon. We, at FEI, are proud that our electronics can be found in some of the most important tactical and strategic military assets of the United States and its allies.",
         "As we complete a couple of the programs that have been nagging us, I expect that our overall financial performance will continue to improve. We, of course, continue to focus on internal operational improvements and cost reductions. One example is our continuing rollout of a new ERP system that is helping us streamline our manufacturing and program management processes.",
         "While this quarter showed a net operating loss on a non-GAAP pro forma basis, taking into account extraordinary legal and insurance expenses and the accounting associated with the problem programs I mentioned above, we would be profitable. I see that as a significant improvement.",
         "Now let me turn it over to Steve to take you through the financial details. Steve?",
         "Thank you, Steve. We'll take questions now, and let me ask the operator to come back on and tell you how to do that. Operator? Hello, Hector, are you there? Did we lose the line? No.",
         "Yes. Yes. Go ahead, please."

         "Thank you, Stan, and good afternoon. For the three months ended July 31, 2020, consolidated revenue was $13 million, up 3% compared to $12.6 million for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The components of revenue are as follows: revenue from commercial and U.S. government satellite programs was $6.7 million compared to $3.9 million for the same period of the prior fiscal year and accounted for approximately 51% of consolidated revenues compared to 31% for the same period of the prior fiscal year.",
         "Revenues on satellite payload contracts are recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method and are recorded only in the FEI-New York segment. Revenues from non-space U.S. Government and DOD customers, which are recorded in both the FEI-New York and FEI-Zyfer segments was $5.3 million compared to $6.7 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year and accounted for approximately 41% of consolidated revenue compared to 54% for the prior fiscal year. Other commercial and industrial revenues were $1 million compared to $1.9 million in the prior fiscal year. Intersegment revenues are eliminated in consolidation.",
         "For the three-month period ending July 31, 2020, the gross margin and gross margin rate both increased marginally over the same period in fiscal 2020. The increase is primarily due to product mix. There were higher engineering costs on several programs in both periods, but as these programs are completed, we expect margins to increase.",
         "For the three months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, selling and administrative costs were approximately 25% and 20%, respectively of consolidated revenue. The increase is due to additional insurance costs and professional fees relating to litigation for which we expect to receive a partial reimbursement through the company's insurance.",
         "R&D expense for the three months ending July 31, 2020 and 2019 decreased to $1.2 million from $2.3 million, a decrease of $1.1 million and were 9% and 18% of consolidated revenue. The decrease is due to previous R&D efforts that have ended and turned into production. However, the company plans to continue to invest in R&D.",
         "For the three months ended July 31, 2020, the company recorded an operating loss of $337,000 compared to $780,000 in the prior year. The operating loss reflects improved in revenue, gross margin and gross margin rate. Other income consists primarily investment income derived from the company's holdings of marketable securities. The prior year investment income included a dividend received from Morion of $125,000. This yields a pretax loss of approximately $253,000 compared to a pretax loss of approximately $570,000 for the previous year.",
         "For the three months ending July 31, 2020, the company recorded a tax provision of $9,000 compared to $19,000 for the same period of fiscal 2020.",
         "Consolidated net loss for the three months ending July 31, 2020, was $262,000 or $0.03 per diluted share compared to $591,000 or $0.07 per diluted share in the previous year.",
         "Our fully funded backlog at the end of July 2020 was approximately $38 million, up approximately $2 million from the previous year-end April 30, 2020. The company's balance sheet continues to reflect the strong working capital position of approximately $39 million at July 31, 2020, and a current ratio of approximately 4.6:1.",
         "The company believes that its liquidity is adequate to meet its operating and investing needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.",
         "I will turn the call back to Stan, and we look forward to your questions later."

      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So let me start by trying to make sure that I articulate these terms because I know there tends to be some confusion. So when we get a contract -- and this is very typical of government contracts. In fact, I would hesitate to say it's universal, but it's very common when you get a government contract that the government will award the contract and -- but they don't fund the entire contract value, they fund it incrementally. And so there's a limitation of liability on the government's part that is associated with the amount of the funding. So you could have a valid contract for, let's say, $10, it could be only funded at the $2 level. And for us, what we do is we record the $2, which is funded in the backlog. So when Steve talks about backlog, that's how we account for that.",
            "Now to further confuse things, you can also have a contract with options. So in that case, let's say you have, again, a $10 contract. It includes another option for another $5 million, let's say. So the total contract value might be $15 million, but the $5 million options are not exercised, and then you have the funding limitation also. So you could have a $15 million contract that has $10 million base contract that's funded at $2 million but also has an additional $5 million worth of options. So that is the case on several of our programs. We have contracts which are at a particular value, but the funding has been limited. So what we report to you in public is the backlog. So when we say backlog, that is completely funded.",
            "Most of our contracts are either -- if they're not direct with the government, they are to government prime contractors, and the contractual slowdowns associated with those contracts are essentially the same as what the government does for the prime contractor. So that's the way things work.",
            "And you asked about trends. So at the moment, we're seeing an increase in the number of contract awards. We've reported probably 5. I think we had maybe 4 or 5 press releases here in the last couple of months, some of them significant. So the trend for contract awards is increasing, and the funding has been flowing pretty readily. So at the moment, all those contracts are adequately funded. And as far as I can tell, they'll continue through to their -- at least to their base values. We would anticipate that the options associated with those will largely get exercised at some point as well. Did that answer your question?"

         "Speaker": "Stanton Sloane"
      },
      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "It does. And just tagging on to that, to move -- in your hypothetical $10 million base contract with $2 million funding, that other $8 million that we want to get funded, is that something that's totally out of your control and in the control of the customer? Or is there something that you proactively can do to accelerate or be a catalyst to it being funded?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Brett Reiss "
      },
      "18": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Ultimately, it's controlled by the government, but we don't -- usually, there's not a problem. If the government, for example, initiates a contract for a satellite, and they have -- I don't know, they're one-third of the way through construction of the satellite, they're going to fund the completion of the satellite. I mean it'd be very unusual if they didn't do that. Sometimes they do stretch the funding. They'll stretch the schedule so that the funding in any one fiscal year spreads a little bit more. That happens. But by and large, once these programs are underway, they tend to get funded."
