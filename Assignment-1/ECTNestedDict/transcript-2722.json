         "Thanks, Ali, and good morning, everybody and thank you for joining us today on our call. Let me begin by highlighting some of our key financial metrics followed by some color on our operations during the second quarter, how we managed to optimize our business during the global pandemic and what we have seen so far in the third quarter, which given us continued competence across our business segments. After that I will hand the call over to J Code who will drill further into the numbers.",
         "In the back of a strong first quarter and despite the impact of COVID-19 global pandemic, we had a robust second quarter with record and near record results across our key metrics. We continued seeing an increased upward momentum in pricing, which combined with good volumes across the board resulted in a very strong quarter.",
         "As you may recall, during our first quarter conference call, we were abundantly clear about our concerns and strategies to work through the unknown and immeasurable impact of COVID-19 global pandemic on our business.",
         "Despite the impact of the global pandemic across various geographies and in markets, our business was classified in essential service, experienced record growth at the top line during the quarter and surpassed the 1.4 billion mark on a trailing 12-month basis. We accomplished this with relentless focus on margins, cost management, reducing our working capital requirements, which resulted in robust quarterly performance.",
         "During the second quarter, we experienced continued resilience across our business segments with steady end market demand resulting in a 7% increase in sales when compared to the same period in 2019.",
         "Our treated wood business particularly strong performance during the period due to the positive impact from increased demand and volumes coming from consumers spending more time and efforts on home renovation and repair projects. This quote unquote stay-at-home and do-it-yourself renovation repair market has been and continues to be extremely robust. We continue to see this trend moving into the third quarter. ",
         "As a result, I\u2019m pleased to report that during the second quarter, we again achieved very strong results across our key financial metrics, with revenues increasing 7% to 414 million, gross margin dollars increased 8.3% to 58.9 million or 14.3% of revenues, EBITDA increasing 20% to 32.8 million and net earnings increased 62.8%, 12.7 million and $0.14 per share dividend was paid all shareholders on July 15th.",
         "April and June 15th, our Board of Directors adjusted the company\u2019s quarterly common share dividend from $0.14 to $0.12 per share, effective for the dividend, which is expected to be paid on October 15, 2020 to shareholders of record on September 30, 2020.",
         "The adjusted to the dividend in the third quarter is a prudent measure to enhance our capital and financial flexibility. Given the general uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 we believe it is for the benefit and the best long-term interest of all of our shareholders and other stakeholders.",
         "We are extremely encouraged with our second quarter and year-to-date results and continue to build on the decisive steps taken beginning in the first quarter. Through our responsive and focused efforts on operational efficiencies cost savings, capital expenditure focus and working capital optimization.",
         "We successfully reduced our loans and borrowings by approximately 90 million when compared to the same period in 2019. We are particularly proud that we were able to deliver the strong operating results with leaner inventory levels, while continuing to meet or exceed customer expectations of product availability.",
         "And looking ahead to commodity pricing environment continues to show up over momentum, which is carried in third quarter. We remain very confident in our ability to work through these volatile times and unprecedented environment. We will continue to protect our balance sheet to enable us to be well positioned to take advantage of measured growth opportunities. ",
         "With that, I would like to ask Jay Code, our CFO to take over and provide a review of the company\u2019s second quarter financial results in greater detail. And then we will open the call for questions. Thanks over to you, Jay. "

      "James Code": [
         "Thank you, Amar and good morning everyone. Sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 were $412.9 million, compared to $385.7 million in the same period in 2019, representing an increase of $27.2 million, or 7.1%, due to the factors to be discussed.",
         "Despite the general economic impact of the pandemic. Sales for the distribution segment increased by $31.3 million, or 8.4%, demonstrating the company\u2019s continued resilience and steady overall and market demand for its products.",
         "Year-over-year increase in the company\u2019s sales is attributable to improvements in both sales volumes and pricing. Quarantine related to home improvement activities resulted an increased demand from consumers spending more time and effort on home renovation and repair projects.",
         "Additionally, construction materials pricing generally increased during the second quarter of 2020. As the economy began to reopen in certain jurisdictions that previously had restricted activity.",
         "The company\u2019s sales by product group in the quarter were made up of 67% construction materials, compared to 62% during the same quarter last year, with the remaining balance resulting from specialty and allied products of 28% and forestry and other revenues of 5%.",
         "Gross margin dollars increased to $58.9 million in the quarter, compared to $54.4 million in the same quarter of 2019 an increase a $4.5 million. Gross margin percentage was 14.3% in the quarter, an increase from the 14.1% achieved in the same quarter 2019.",
         "The year-over-year increase in gross margin is mainly attributable to the previously discussed improvements in sales volumes, and construction materials pricing during the second quarter of 2020.",
         "Overall expenses for the quarter ended June 30th, 2020 we are $37.2 million as compared to $37.6 million for the same quarter in 2019, a decrease of $425,000 or 1.2% due to the factors discussed below. As a percentage of sales expenses were 9% in the quarter compared to 9.7% during the same quarter in 2019.",
         "Distribution, selling and administration expenses decreased by $868,000 or 3.2% to $26.1 million in the second quarter of 2020 from $27 million in the same period of 2019. During the quarter, the company continued to take steps to mitigate the pandemics impact including implementing salary and working hours reductions, evaluating ongoing costs, savings opportunities, ultimately resulting in lower distribution selling and administration expenses.",
         "As a percentage of sales, these expenses were 6.3% in the quarter compared to 7% in the same quarter in 2019. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $403,000 or 3.8% from $10.6 million to $11 million in 2020.",
         "Finance costs for the second quarter of 2020 were $4.2 million compared to $6 million in the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of $1.8 million or 29.3% partly due to lower interest rates on the company\u2019s variable rate, revolving loan facility and partly due to lower average for links during the period.",
         "The significant decrease in debt is largely result a result of a company successful reduction of its working capital levels in response to the pandemic as total loans and borrowings decreased by $89.9 million relative to June 30, 2019.",
         "EBITDA was $32.8 million compared to $27.3 million in the comparative quarter of 2019, an increase of $5.5 million or 20.1% largely due to the improvements in both sales volumes and construction materials pricing as a result of the previously discussed quarantine related home improvement activities during the second quarter of 2020. As a result of these factors net earnings for the three month period ended June 30, 2020 were $12.7 million versus $7.8 million in the comparative period of 2019.",
         "Turning now to the statement of cash flows in the first six months of 2020 operating activities generated 42.2 million in cash before non-cash working capital changes compared to $31.3 million during the same period in 2019.",
         "The company generally experiences higher levels of non-cash working capital during the first and second quarters and a decrease in non-cash working capital during the third and fourth quarters due to ordinary seasonal factors relating to the company\u2019s business cycle.",
         "The changing working capital in the six month period of in 2020 was comprised of an increase in trade and other receivables of $131 million a decrease in inventory of $74.7 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and deposits of $72,000 and a net increase in trade and other payables and performance bond obligations of $39.8 million.",
         "Financing activities consumed $17.8 million of cash compared to generating 88.2 million in the same period in 2019, the revolving loan facility increased by just $19.2 million over the six month period compared to an increase of $124.3 million in the same period in 2019.",
         "The significant year-over-year decrease in net advances from a revolving loan facility as a result of the previously discussed inventory reductions during the second quarter of 2020 in response to the pandemic. The company was not in breach of any of its lending covenants during the six months ended June 30, 2020.",
         "Net repayment of equipment loans amounted to $1.6 million, compared with $1.1 million in 2019. Payment of lease liabilities including interest consumed $12.6 million of cash, compared to 11.4 million in 2019. There are no common shares we purchased during the six month period ended June 30, 2020, compared to $616,000 in cash consumed to repurchase common shares under the company\u2019s normal course issuer bid in 2019.",
         "Dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter amounted to $10.9 million, consistent with the same period in 2019. And the dividends declared and paid on a per share basis were unchanged from 2019. As Amar mentioned on June 15th as part of the company\u2019s balance sheet, flexibility and protection strategy. The Board of Directors adjusted the quarterly dividend from $0.14 per common share to $0.12 per common share beginning in October 2020.",
         "Investing activities consumed $1.4 million, compared to $17.9 million in the same period in 2019. Investing activities in 2019 included the Lignum acquisition for a net amount of $14.1 million with no acquisitions in the six months period ended June 30, 2020.",
         "The remaining decrease in investing activities is largely the result of the company\u2019s minimizing its capital expenditures in response to the pandemic. Purchases of property, plant and equipment of $1.3 million in the first six months of 2020, compared favorably to purchases of $3.6 million in 2019.",

And you will see some permanent SG&A reductions going forward. I can\u2019t give you the number, but it will be reduced from what it was in 2019, no matter what the business outlook looks like. "

It is extremely strong, Paul. I don\u2019t know how else to put it. I don\u2019t want to be promotional, but I haven\u2019t seen this in 30-years. It is an incredible home improvement run in North America. And all we are hearing from our customer base is ship us faster and ship us more."

            "So when we looked at the wood product side some items were six to eight weeks ago having said that we do have inventories and thank god we have a lot of contracts with our great sawmill suppliers. So we are receiving word on a regular basis. On the spot market, you would be in trouble trying to find wood today.",
            "When you get into our allied lines, we don\u2019t see as much tension there. Whether it is roofing insulation, those products are readily available, but it is really the wood product side being lumber plywood OSB, will that realistic tough shortages today. But the rest of the items, pretty good shape in getting them and turning those over."

The U.S. business is extremely strong on treated lumber. Plywood, it is nonexistent you can\u2019t find it OSB, it is extremely busy. These are all construction materials.",
            "When you add in that backyard stuff that we do a ton in. So let\u2019s take a quick look at treated lumber, composite, fencing. Those items are, selling at a pace that I have never seen before. And, we are in the right spot at the right time for that activity in your backyard."

We are going to be a little cautious just on kind of what we are looking at acquiring due to just, I think everybody is in the same boat. We just don\u2019t have a gigantic outlook, because we are just not in the normal world of what is going on.",
            "Having said that, there is some acquisitions that are, \u201ctuck-ins\u201d for us that are strategic, that we will continue to execute on within the next 12-months. And, we have, I think, done a good job in resetting the company, not only on the cash flow with the dividend, the debt reduction, giving us a lot of room for these opportunities, without having to you really look towards equity markets, et cetera. So, we are in the best shape we have ever been for them, and we will continue to look at them, but I think Yuri probably smaller and more strategic than anything larger at this point."

            "So, we are just struggling trying to now keep up and try to get our harvesting in motion faster at this point. So there is a large demand as you would expect now with lumber prices where they are mills are dying for logs, and we are just trying to get a harvest as efficient as possible and as quick as possible right now."

So that combined with that reduction of 90 million, as lumber almost doubling from its low - same with panels and OSB.",
            "We have done a hell of a job here now, can we run it this forever? I\u2019m not sure. I know that talking to our big box customers or pro dealers independence, we don\u2019t want to be out of stock and we haven\u2019t been, it is been tough because sales are up so strong on seasonal items.",
            "I can definitely assure you that the run rate will continue to be lower. Is it 90 million? I think, recently we are down another 20 million and it is going to move around, but we will definitely run at a much lower rate than we were before. Just because, we have found out there is areas where we can be better and we can be more nimble and turn faster.",
            "But again, having said that, if the sales pace continues, we definitely have to lay down some more inventory earlier for 2021 than we would have in 2019 for 2020. So I can put it into a number, but we are definitely going to be significantly lower going forward."

I just, I don\u2019t know how long that\u2019s going to go, but from what I can see, this is a true shortage. So this rally will continue until production catches up with demand, which I don\u2019t see happening anytime soon. "

So we are using copper [indiscernible] in California now, and we are no longer using ACQ and in Canada we are pretty much 100% micro prose Sarnia with a little bit of CCA on the industrial side.

Our business there is sort of flat, which we are pretty happy about at this point. Projects, on the electrical side, we have electrical business there. It is, a bit slower than we would like, but you haven\u2019t seen a plummet.",

So we are right in tune with our customer base. Call it flat to off 3% to 4% and again, for us at that pace, it is not worrisome for us, we just know that Hawaii will recover once they get tourism back and a whole bunch of things.",

But if you look at our whole U.S. business unit, California and then U.S. mainland being so strong for us usually, it easily offsets any minor pain in the 50 state."

            "So right now, on the treated lumber, we are hand to mouth for all of our customers, almost on an allocation basis, so whatever we produce is shipped. And it is hard because we have a lot of long-term customers that we want to take care of, and it is sort of who gets what so. We really have to prioritize and try to evenly measure who gets our material. It is that busy. I have never seen it like this."
