         "Thank you for the introduction. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our conference call on our Q2 results.",
         "Geberit delivered very good results during the COVID-19 crisis in the second quarter. Let me start with the key statements.",
         "The EBITDA margin reached in the second quarter previous year's level, despite a substantial decline in net sales of minus 16%. The resilience of the margin in the second quarter led to an increase of 70 basis points of EBITDA margin in the first half of the year and reached 31.5%.",
         "The EBIT margin reached 26.3% almost previous year's level. The net income margin decreased slightly by one percentage point in the first half of the year to 21.4% due to an increased tax rate and weaker financial results.",
         "Before we discuss the financial results of the first half year, let me briefly summarize our sales results which we already communicated on July 6.",
         "Net days in Swiss francs decreased in the first six months by minus 9.8%, driven by the COVID-19 crisis and the negative currency development. In local currencies, net sales decreased by 4.5% in the first half and by minus 10.7% in the second quarter.",
         "The negative COVID-19 impact on demand varied substantially by geography depending on the degree of the local lockdown. In markets, where construction sites are closed, around 20% of our sales exposure, volumes declined substantially, or in some cases even collapsed in the second quarter, the countries include Italy, France, Spain, the U.K., India and South Africa.",
         "The remaining countries were also impacted by lower construction activity imposed by COVID-19 restrictions, which then leads to a sales decline in Q2, however, much less pronounced.",
         "Let me now comment on the operating and financial results in the first half of the year. EBITDA decreased under proportionally compared to net sales by minus 7.8% to CHF 462 million. The EBITDA margin reached 31.5%.",
         "Despite the net sales decrease of minus 10%, we were able to increase EBITDA margin by 70 basis points. The main drivers for this margin improvement were fast and targeted cost containment measures. A high-end even further increased flexibility in production and logistics to cope with a substantial decline in volume, lower raw material prices and increased sales prices.",
         "It is worth to mention that these results were achieved without restructuring salary cuts or support from the public sector. For example, through short-term work. The public support from short-term work was minimal, since we consciously decided to introduce short-term work only very selectively and for a very short period of time France, U.K. and Italy the countries, which were most hit by the lockdown.",
         "The negative currency effects of minus 5.3% of net sales in the first half of the year has only a minor impact on the EBITDA margin due to our strategy and our continued efforts to achieve a natural currency hedge.",
         "EBIT decreased in the first six months by minus 10.5% to CHF 386 million in line with net sales leading to an EBIT margin of 26.3%, 20 basis points below previous year's level.",
         "The slightly weaker development of the EBIT margin versus the EBITDA margin was driven by higher depreciation costs from higher investments in previous years.",
         "Net income decreased by 13.9% slightly disproportionally to EBIT CHF 350 million due to a higher tax rate driven by the new tax regime in Switzerland effective as of the year and the weaker financial results in 2020.",
         "Earnings per share decreased by minus 13.5% to CHF 8.77 positively affected by the share buyback program. The first half of the year 262,000 shares have been bought back under the program launch in June 2017 and an average share price of CHF 406. In total, 1,026,000 shares have been bought back since 2017 for a total consideration of CHF 440 million. The share buyback program has been finished in April this year according to plan.",
         "Free cash flow decreased in the first half of the year and minus 32% to CHF 174 million. This over proportional decrease was driven by two factors. First, a negative base effect with an extraordinary strong free cash flow in the previous year when free cash flow increased by 35%. And second, an increase in net working capital due to the strong sales dynamic within Q2 starting with a substantial decline in April and the recovery towards end of June.",
         "In order to leverage the low interest rate environment and the strong debt capacity of our balance sheet, we issued in April a standard Swiss franc bond in the amount of CHF 300 million with the maturity of 2.5 years and a coupon of 35 basis points. With this, it remains to be very solidly defined.",
         "At the end of June, we hold cash position of CHF 350 million, and the unused revolving credit facility of CHF 500 million.",
         "Let me now comment on our outlook for the remaining year. Let me start by saying that ongoing uncertainties around the COVID-19 crisis making the outlook still very difficult and uncertain. Accordingly, our outlook is subject to uncertainties and based on the assumption of no lockdowns or material businesses restriction driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "Let me start with the current business performance. In July sales were slightly above previous year level, driven by stock rebuilding effect of wholesalers in companies which were severely hit by the lockdown, for example, in Italy, or in France.",
         "Under the assumption of no COVID-19 imposed lockdown or material business restrictions, we expect in the second half of the year, further normalization of the building construction industry. However, delayed or stopped projects, especially in the non-residential segment and the temporary closure of customer showrooms in the second quarter might have an increasingly negative impact on demand during the second half of the year.",
         "On these assumptions, we expect currency adjusted net sales in the second half of the year to be slightly below the second half of 2019. And an EBITDA margin for the full year slightly below 2019 level.",
         "The weaker outlook for the EBITDA margin in the second half of the year compared to the margin increase we achieved in the first half of the year is driven by three factors. First, generally increasing costs again due to the normalization of the business, after the sharp decline in Q2, for example, for marketing, or the release of the hiring freeze.",
         "Second, raw material prices, which started to increase again since June and tougher comps from lower raw material prices in the second half of 2019. And thirdly, a higher wage inflation, since several tariff increases this year become all effective as of the second half of the year.",
         "Let me close our introduction with a short summary. The last couple of months were marked by a historical business collapse in terms of speed and extent. However, Geberit delivered very good results. First, our supply chain was not materially affected by the COVID-19 imposed restrictions and the availability of our product assortment but in short.",
         "The stability of our supply chain was largely driven by our strategy to pursue a high degree of vertical integration in manufacturing, decreasing the dependencies from suppliers and our strategy to source and to manufacture locally, close to our customers in our end markets.",
         "Secondly, we were able to maintain our industry leading profitability on previous year's level despite the unprecedented collapse in volume in the second quarter and this without restructuring efforts or support for the public sector.",
         "Lower raw material price helped, but were not the main driver. And main reasons for the strong profitability were at half and consequent crisis management based on short decision making processes and the lean organization. The continued investments in further optimization and process flexibility over the past years, and finally, the flexibility and the high commitment of our employees based on good and trustful relationships between employees and management.",
         "This unprecedented crisis reveals the fundamental strength and resilience of our strategy, our business model, our stability and our strong company culture, key assets during times of crisis.",
         "Thank you for your attention. We are now ready to answer your questions."

And we see your R&D flat year-on-year your IT personnel is up year-on-year as you say in the statement. Could you maybe talk a bit more about what is in the pipeline? What are you working on, what is there that we can expect from Geberit over the next 12 months in this kind of digital assets in new product introductions, and how you'd expect that to influence the performance."

            "I have a couple of questions. First of all, turning to Slide number 10 on your presentation. I'm surprised by the strong positive effect of other costs, which was plus 0.7%. I think in the first quarter, it was a minus of 0.2% or 0.5%. What were the main drivers you mentioned some on the high level, but maybe a bit more detail and what should we expect for the second half of the year?"

      },
      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "There are two main drivers for this good development of other costs, was number one, the fast and consequent implement cost containment measures. For example, in marketing, for example, in administration, some of them were easy to achieve because we were not able to travel for example, and others were conscious decision which we took to adapt our organization very fast to the new market reality that is the first bucket. And the second bucket is the flexibility mainly of our personnel in plants and logistics, they achieve the high flexibility driven by temporary workers but also a flexibility of permanent staff in the plants for example, by vacation planning, or using the flexibility from flex time model which we have in place in the branch, logistics in some of the plants we even increased the flexibility during the crisis in alignment with the [indiscernible]."

         "Speaker": "Christian Buhl"
      },
      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And then, maybe adding to that, you were mentioning that in the second half you envisage wage inflation. I was just wondering whether there is no room to renegotiate with employees because of the economic environment and the pressure on wage inflation shouldn't be that high in this state of environment."

            "I give you two answers. The first answer is no, there is no legal room because that is negotiated by the [indiscernible], with the company representatives, we do not have any influence. And by a certain coincidence this year made in Germany, the tariff increase is happening more in the second half of the year than in the first of the year.",
            "My second answer is even if we would have the flexibility, we would not start to renegotiate our wages in the second half of the year, if we have seen the results of this organization and employees delivered, especially in the second quarter."

            "Can you give us an idea of your expectations of the development of the demand in Germany and in Switzerland in the second half? And the second question I have, as with Corona situation nothing changed on the situation with the lack of capacity of installers in Germany. And last is, still planned and a new share buy back program started in Q3 or Q4, or you have other ideas yet. Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "Regarding the demand in Switzerland and Germany, we are fundamentally positive for the second half of the year for the demand in these two countries. However, as I said before, also in these countries, we have seen that certain projects have been late or even postponed in the second quarter that might have more negative impact in the course of the second half of the year.",
            "The second questions around the bottleneck of installers in Germany, the bottleneck came down in April quite substantially, as we already talked about in July and started now to end to increase in July, the order backlog came back again. It's actually at 11.8 week still somewhat below previous year's level of essentially higher than during the lockdown in April and May.",
            "Third question around the share buyback program, we have announced that we will launch a third program, it is prepared. It is mandated to a bank and it's expected that the bank will start the share buyback program in the course of the second half of the year."

Obviously a little bit more difficult usually to track for us. Then secondly, can you quantify the additional IT costs for your digitalization initiatives in the first half. And then finally, CapEx was just slightly down in the first half year? Is this also your guidance for the full year? Thank you."

I mean in India and South Africa, it's visible that is much more difficult that these companies are coming back to a normal level. As I said before in July, we have the [indiscernible] sales again in Italy, and also in France, for example, driven by restocking effects. South Africa and India are still struggling much more.",
            "The second question, additionally, measurements for the digitalization efforts this year is 15 million for the entire year but [indiscernible] it in the first half of the year, the second half of the year, I do not know the exact figure.",

Can you give us any kind of quantification on that and any kind of numbers? How much below you think it'll be below last year's second half? That's my first question. And then the second one is, you're seeing some kind of recovery in market. And I was wondering like, where are you seeing a kind of improvements and how much you would consider coming back and how much of that is coming back? I cannot?"

            "And the second question, although very difficult to give you -- but I think there's one observation which we have seen over the last month, it might be that it's also the case for the second half of the year. Then in general, weaker economies, obviously with weaker health systems are recovering much more slowly, more slower than other countries. For example, Italy, France are coming out relatively fast. On the other end, India, South Africa are still very much struggling, the U.K. somewhat in the middle."

Which is one reason why EBITDA margin is going down in the second half according to your guidance. You then said that Q3 actually sequentially increasing year-over-year, they still have a positive impact. So, that implies that in Q4 you expect greater increase in material prices year-over-year. I mean, is that correct and could you give us here some more flavors in terms of which material prices you expect to increase quite substantial in Q4."

So, can you just highlight I mean, what is the general time like between the raw material price development and the P&L impact? The third is, I wanted to know you said you did 160 million buyback in this quarter. So, what was the average buyback price I mean for these buybacks and also wanted to understand because you're going to do third buyback program. So, is there -- is this just an opportunity like you just do like, you have the cash flow and you do the buyback or you take a call on the fair price, I mean the valuation is right to do the buybacks what is the process behind.

Obviously, shower toilet, fundamentally address hygienic topics. And we do not stop in terms of development of shower toilet, new product for shower toilets, of course.
