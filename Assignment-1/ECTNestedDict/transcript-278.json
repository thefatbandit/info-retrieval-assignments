         "Thank you, Tim and good afternoon. NeoPhotonics\u2019 performance remains strong with Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.16, higher than our guidance range, as a result of outstanding execution by our team and our suppliers in a challenging quarter. As Tim mentioned, revenue was $103.2 million, above the high end of our outlook. Huawei was 52% and our next four customers contributed 30% of revenue, similar to last quarter.",
         "Our revenue was not materially impacted by the most recent U.S. Department of Commerce restrictions on the sale of customer designed products designed or manufactured using U.S. software or manufacturing equipment, as we design all of our own products. Similarly, as we stated in our press release dated May 26, based on our review of the products we ship, our revenue was not materially impacted by the addition of FiberHome and their affiliates to the entities list. We remain committed to complying with all U.S. EAR rules.",
         "Our Non-GAAP Q2 gross margin was 33.2%, coming in toward the high end of our range. Within this, product margins were 36.3%,up slightly from last quarter on increased volume. Other cost of sales charges of 3.1 percentage points improved sequentially, as expected. These charges were approximately: a point of warranty charges, a point of residual tariff adjustments, a half a point of underutilization and other minor charges.",
         "Total non-GAAP operating expense for the second quarter was $23.6 million, slightly lower than expected on continued push-outs related to COVID-19 impacts. The spending delays are not impacting our project timing. As we said last quarter, we expect to make up the first half under spend in the back half of the year to ensure continued success on our 64 Gbaud and 400ZR programs.",
         "Non-GAAP operating profit for the second quarter was a record for NeoPhotonics at $10.7 million, or 10.4%, reflecting both the increasing leadership of our products and our continued strong execution. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $8.7 million, or 8.4%.",
         "I will close out my discussion of the second quarter income statement with a review of our GAAP results. Second quarter gross margin was 32.5%, up two points from Q1, driven by an increase in volume.",
         "Operating expense was $26.9 million, up $4.5 million quarter-over-quarter as expected, with the lack of the one-time license credit in Q1 and higher variable compensation expense.",
         "Operating profit for the second quarter was $6.6 million, which included $3.8 million of stock-based compensation expense and approximately, $0.3 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other costs.",
         "Net profit for the quarter was $5.7 million, compared to a profit of $6.3 million in the prior period.",
         "Turning to the balance sheet, our cash position continued to improve to $113 million of cash, short-term investments and restricted cash. Cash from operations was $10 million and we paid down $4 million of debt, while increasing our inventory as planned, to buffer continued supply chain volatility. We continue to be well positioned to invest in our next phase of growth.",
         "Before I discuss our earnings and revenue outlook for the third quarter of 2020, I would like to remind everyone of our public filings with the SEC and our Safe Harbor Statement included in our press release that discusses the risks and uncertainties that could affect future performance, causing actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.",
         "As we have noted in the last few quarters, we believe that Huawei and their affiliate HiSilicon have been building strategic inventory. We believe this action is now complete and future orders will better reflect end-customer demand. As Tim mentioned, given the strength in demand of our highest speed products, we expect that our other customers will continue to ramp, largely offsetting the Huawei decrease. The net result is a Q3 revenue outlook, which is nominally in line with Q2.",
         "Gross margin reflects some increase in underutilization charges. This is the result of slower than planned deployments, due to COVID-19, of customer\u2019s silicon photonics-based transceivers that use our fixed wavelength lasers.",
         "As I mentioned earlier, operating expense is increasing in the back half of the year, to maintain the planned investment in 64 Gbaud and 400ZR for the year. We believe that investment will continue to drive both revenue growth and customer diversification in 2021 and beyond.",
         "In Q3, we are taking the unusual move of including a $1 million FX impact in our forecast, or a $0.02 per share adverse impact, as we have seen an increase in the value of the Chinese Yuan relative to the U.S. dollar. As a reminder, this impact is the non-cash revaluation of our U.S. dollar assets on our China balance sheet and will change if the U.S. dollar valuation recovers.",
         "Given that, the company\u2019s expectations for the September 2020 quarter are: revenue in the range of $97 million to $105 million; GAAP gross margin in the range of 29% to 33%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 30% to 34%; GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of a $0.03 loss to a $0.07 profit, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of a $0.03 to $0.13 profit. These numbers are reflective of approximately $54.7 million fully diluted shares.",
         "In summary, we have now had eight quarters of delivering year-over-year revenue growth, expanding gross margins and positive free cash flow. We have also delivered four quarters in a row of profitability. Q2 revenue grew 26% year-over-year and our non-GAAP gross margins expanded by eight points over the same period last year, demonstrating our focus to drive profitability. Net cash increased from $26 million to $77 million from the same period last year, putting us in a good position to fund long-term growth with an expanded customer base. We are excited about our growth prospects.",
         "This concludes our formal comments and now, I will ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Brad?"

         "Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us to discuss NeoPhotonics operating results for the second quarter of 2020 and outlook for the third quarter of 2020. On the call today are Tim Jenks, Chairman and CEO, and Beth Eby, Chief Financial Officer.",
         "Tim will begin with a review of the company\u2019s business in the second quarter and a discussion of market drivers and products. Beth will then provide financial results for the second quarter before providing the outlook for the third quarter of 2020. Beth will then open the call for questions.",
         "The company\u2019s press release and management\u2019s statements during this call include discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures and information, including all income statement and balance sheet amounts and percentages other than revenue, unless otherwise noted.

      "Tim Jenks": [
         "Thank you, Erica, and good afternoon. Our business continues to perform well despite the challenges of operating through a full quarter in the COVID pandemic. We continue to put the highest priority on the health and safety of our employees, our supply partners and their families.",
         "Revenue in the second quarter was $103 million, growing 26% year-over-year compared to 23% growth in the first quarter. Our growth for our last four quarters was 19% over the prior year. Non-GAAP gross margins continued to expand to 33.2%, up 8 percentage points from the year prior and 2 percentage points sequentially. Similarly, our operating margin and EBITDA are at the highest levels in our history. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.16 per share.",
         "Sequential growth was driven by cloud and data center demand, as our 64 Gbaud and other products for 400 gigabit and above applications accelerate. We view ongoing demand for bandwidth and associated infrastructure upgrades for data centers to be an important growth area in the years ahead, notably at 400 gigabit and above.",
         "NeoPhotonics continues to be an industry leader for the highest speed over distance optical network solutions, supplying customers with components and modules, which deliver the highest interconnect bandwidth per wavelength and per fiber for distances at 40 kilometers and longer. Our products enable these highest data rates in backbone networks, regional and metro area networks, and the \u201cbiggest pipes\u201d for data center interconnects.",
         "Our high speed products now consistently represent 90% or more of our business. Within this, our newest and highest speed products, including ultra-pure light tunable lasers, high speed modulators and receivers, are at the core of 400 Gbps, 600 gigabit and 800 gigabit solutions. These components are also used in lower speed applications such as 200 gigabit to extend reach to longer transmission distances. Taken together, these highest speed over distance deployments are forecasted to be among the fastest areas of growth in the industry for the next several years and have been driving our recent growth in both revenue and profitability. We believe that our products for 400 gigabit and above applications will approach 20% of our total revenue this year. Beyond top-line growth, our 400 gigabit and above solutions are also increasing our customer revenue diversification.",
         "At this point, almost all of the world\u2019s leading network equipment customers leverage NeoPhotonics products for their 400 gigabit and faster systems. Moreover, these customers are now ramping their deployments. In the second quarter, excluding our top two customers, our next eight customers combined grew a total of 35% sequentially. We expect this trend to continue. We anticipate that we will have additional industry leaders become 10% customers during the second half of 2020, based on our existing customer orders and delivery commitments for 400 gigabit and above products.",
         "Trade tensions are causing market share shifts between our customers. Due to the breadth of our design wins and customer base, NeoPhotonics is likely to be a beneficiary of these shifts. For example, a market share shift of one 400 gigabit and above port away from our largest customer and to another industry leader would likely be favorable to NeoPhotonics in revenue terms. Similarly, a market share shift of one 100 gigabit port away from our largest customer and to another leader would likely be roughly equivalent to NeoPhotonics in revenue terms.",
         "Over the last year we have reported that our largest customer, Huawei, has had a plan to build strategic inventory due to trade tensions. We believe at this point that they have achieved their goal. As our next group of customers ramp their respective systems for 400 gigabit and above applications, we believe the strength of deployments from these customers will offset potential revenue impact from Huawei\u2019s inventory adjustments.",
         "We previously noted that carriers in China are using the Super C-Band spectral window to increase fiber network capacity, leveraging the NeoPhotonics C++ LASER product and 64 Gbaud component and module solutions. Using higher baud rate is efficient for distance and the expanded spectral range allows additional wavelength channels, increasing fiber capacity in backbone and provincial networks.",
         "Looking beyond 2020, strong progress continues with our 400ZR and 400ZR+ pluggable coherent modules, which we launched in the fourth quarter last year. Our 400ZR and 400ZR+ modules for Cloud and Ethernet applications are in customer qualifications, having moved from initial sampling in the first quarter.",
         "We have taken further steps toward establishing the 400ZR and 400ZR+ ecosystem. Together with Inphi, we completed the industry\u2019s first interoperability demonstration of OIF 400ZR compliant coherent transceivers operating over a 120 kilometer optical fiber link and utilizing multiple wavelengths across the C-Band. Both 400ZR coherent optical transceivers carried error-free traffic, demonstrating the availability of interoperable coherent transceivers from multiple vendors. This is a key step to enable next generation DCI links using IP over DWDM and a 400ZR architecture.",
         "We expect initial volume applications for 400ZR to be with hyperscale customers for data center interconnect. However, with 400ZR+ capability for longer distances, there is also an opportunity for new use cases to emerge beyond data center interconnects, including metro area interconnects, 5G backhaul interconnects, and longer distance regional and long haul interconnects. It is important to note that for NeoPhotonics, the 400ZR and 400ZR+ module market expands our overall TAM as it adds higher ASP module solutions to our existing market leading position in highest speed over distance components.",
         "Additionally, each of these new high speed systems, including 400ZR and 400ZR+ applications, operate over DWDM line systems, including open line systems, that require specific high performance multiplexing products having unique channel spacings and filter shapes, and channel monitors, which we also provide.",
         "Rapidly growing global bandwidth needs continues to be the fundamental driver of our business, whether it be for cloud services, capacity increases due to remote working, high-speed deployments to the edge, or 5G wireless rollouts. With increasing momentum in 400G and above design wins across the major network equipment manufacturers, as well as the 400ZR and 400ZR+ opportunity in 2021, and with caution due to risks related to the ongoing pandemic, we remain optimistic that industry trends continue to move in NeoPhotonics\u2019 favor.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CFO, Beth Eby."

Tim, I want to ask you a big picture question on forgetting \u2013 putting Huawei aside, your U.S.-based largest customer has certainly done a significant amount of vertical integration. How should we be thinking about your non-Huawei business? How are those customers vertically integrating and how do you see your business being impacted by that trend? And are you beginning to see some of that shift already from some of your non-Huawei customers to internally develop some of the components that you were previously supplying to them?"

      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, we do see and we have commented in past quarters about some level of vertical integration. But as I said in the prepared remarks, if we look beyond our top two into our top 10, essentially, the other eight did grow 35% Q2 over Q1. And they are collectively on a growth path. Of those, the vast majority are not vertically integrated. Now, we do expect that the rate of growth will continue and industry forecast suggests that for 400 gigabits and above, the growth rates are expected to be quite good.",
            "And then right now, that is for 400 gig, 600 gig, and to some extent for 800 gig. all of that for us is at a component level with the exception of telecom focused coherent modules. But the \u2013 by the time we get to 2021, then we\u2019re looking at 400ZR being an additional revenue capability and then 400ZR+. So, there are, without doubt, headwinds to vertical integration by the same token. There are continuing to be very good opportunities with an expanding market and expanding TAM that we\u2019re addressing. And these opportunities are really what\u2019s causing us to be pretty excited about the prospects."

         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. And then on the near-term, can you speak to, I mean, there\u2019s always this concern and I appreciate the comments that you had, but maybe, if you can give us some idea in terms of inventory build-up in China. I mean, certainly, 5G is a big piece of the deployment in China. Do you know how much of your revenue can be attributed to 5G deployments versus BCI type deployments? Just kind of help us understand the end application that\u2019s driving much of your demand for your components."

         "Remarks": [
            "Let\u2019s see, for 5G, we have to think about the front-haul, mid-haul and backhaul aspects of a 5G deployment. Early in the deployment, it is mostly front-haul and some mid-haul. our largest position would be in the backhaul, which would move toward a network build out and it is based both on the rate of deployment of the front-haul and the subscriber usage. So essentially, as they deploy a front-haul and mid-haul, they build it up with subscribers, then that requires more capacity for back-haul, and that would use \u2013 that would impact us. So for the part that is, that is front-haul and mid-haul, we do sell some fixed wavelength lasers and components, but it\u2019s actually, a very small percent of our revenue in total. So, there really is a kind of very modest impact on revenue at the moment."

Now, you\u2019re saying your other customers are going to be able to offset some relative weakness in Huawei, but then you also said that Huawei orders would be to meet demand, do you expect Huawei to sustain the current level of inventory and therefore, underlying demand growth out of China would be consistent with the order rate, growth rate, or do you expect them to start to draw inventory down a little bit? I\u2019m not sure. I completely got the subtlety around that."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So, the trade tensions are putting Huawei in a somewhat unique position, and they have built up a strategic inventory and we do expect that they will continue to be purchasing products that are based on their market demand and run rate. as opposed to working down their strategic inventory, that would change if there was a highly favorable change in the trade tensions. but as it is, we do expect to have a smaller revenue base from Huawei as a result, because over the last year, we have had a larger than normal Huawei percent of revenue as they were accumulating a strategic inventory. Historically, over multiple years, looking back about five years, Huawei has been in the range of high 30-s to 40% of revenue, but in the last year, it\u2019s been more like 50%. So that\u2019s how we expect it to play out.",
            "Now, as we look out toward, beyond the quarter and next year, Huawei is in a situation, where they may see, they may be subject to market share shifts. And as I commented, their competitors are our customers as well and the relative balance of market share remains to be playing out. However, if they are losing share, then their inventory actually on a relative basis is probably more than ample. But we do expect them to purchase on an ongoing basis."

Is it fair to think about the sales guidance here, which is kind of down, I think down slightly in the \u2013 at the midpoint here essentially flat, but pretty close as it is safe to think about it Huawei being down in the rest of your revenues kind of flat to up, or should we think about that differently?"

So that yes, their OEMs, but there are a number of companies that have launched 400 gigabit, 600 gigabit and the new systems and demoing even higher speed. And so we\u2019re selling to each of those and as they ramp, that\u2019s seeing a much higher than market average rate of growth. The result of those ramps is, we are seeing increasing quarter-over-quarter revenue, but we\u2019re also seeing strong backlog for subsequent quarters. So, we\u2019re in the situation, where certainly, in the case of Huawei\u2019s unique position, they have been the largest, but they are challenged by the overall trade situation. We\u2019ve got a very strong group of customers relying on our component solutions for their 400 gig, 600 gig and above products. And as those ramps, that\u2019s a very strong growth stream for us going forward and the customers are kind of all in the top 10 network equipment companies in the industry."

Your guidance in your discussion mentioned in a higher level here for this quarter, I think you\u2019re implying and beyond that, how should we think about the trajectory or model for opex as we go out a few quarters years expected to flatten out, or kind of be percent of sales, or how should we think about that?"

Well, a couple of questions, let\u2019s continue on with this sort of discussion around changing customer mix and you mentioned that kind of 35% sequentially, I guess, customers three to 10 in Q2. Do you expect that sort of trajectory to continue into Q3? I guess it\u2019d be the question and in which case, you could see your Huawei concentration come down almost to kind of historical levels, is that the magnitude of shift that you\u2019re implying in the guidance, or might you see that sequential growth rates slow a bit with the new customers."

We do expect that rate of growth to continue based on our view of our committed shipments and our backlog. for these higher speed systems, we have a range of products that we sell. We have narrow line with lasers, which are critical and the highest rate systems. We have our coherent driver modulator or CDM. We have our high bandwidth receivers. We combine these together in our CFP2, 400 gig module and different customers qualify one to all of these products. And so each customer is a little different in terms of their content, but for some customers as they ramp, our content is very, very strong. And this is why I said in my prepared remarks that we can be a beneficiary of this as customers argue over market share."

So, it sounds like in addition to the different customer mix here, you might have kind of mixed issues going on a couple of different fronts that I\u2019d like to ask about one, I think you alluded to was maybe component versus module, right, where some of these newer customers you\u2019re seeing come in, might be more focused on the module level. I don\u2019t know if that has, or maybe a revenue plus possibly a margin minus, I\u2019m not sure. And then can you speak to whether there is a changing kind of end-market mix, as that customer mix shifts in that, do you see at 400 gig in a more cloud type applications versus carrier metro and long-haul transport applications?"

So for the \u2013 right now, the 400 gigabit, 600 gigabit and above applications are primarily components in line card that are essentially fabricated by network equipment manufacturers, some of which are used in DCI. The preponderance are telco. The designs that we have and products for coherent modules do include the CFP2 400 gigabit product that is capable of distances, essentially much longer than ZR alone. And so these are four regional network applications and kind of leading market for that kind of deployment actually is the market in China. For \u2013 in 2021, we would expect to be then ramping 400ZR, cloud and Ethernet versions, this for us would mean the OSFP form factor and QSFP-DD form factor.

But the interoperability test was also mentioned. and so was some \u2013 at least some opinion over there about prospects extending beyond the DCI market and the ZR could have \u2013 as you mentioned in your remarks in the significant applications on the telecom side, I think you mentioned metro in a range. So, would you save visibility toward those applications, has increased for you over the last quarter or so, as you\u2019ve moved from sampling into qualification, maybe, you could characterize your opportunities, cloud versus telecom and with that telecom has increased over that time period."

And I think you referred to Inphi\u2019s call this morning, I think we would agree with their timing of it being mostly 2021, and with volume in the second half of 2021. Our product offerings do include capabilities for taking this to ZR \u2013 400ZR, but also for 400ZR+. And this is where, as I said in my prepared remarks, we would expect there to be additional use cases. And the use cases do extend for these longer interconnects. So, not just data center interconnect, but metro 5G backhaul, and regional and long-haul interconnects. And so these would essentially be the telco. So, the 400G in the ZR our application is cloud first, but then the additional use cases would have a gain share in telco applications. Does help? Okay."

I think that the view is increasing closer to a $1 billion opportunity over three years for the market. And so we\u2019re competing for a share of that opportunity. That would be the size of the ZR TAM, if you will.",

But again, the first real application is 400ZR serving the cloud with respect to DSPs, we do \u2013 we did the interop with Inphi. And we did say in that press release that we use a DSP for that product from them and they have been a strong partner. We have also deployed in the past other coherent module products using DSPs including from NEL in Japan. So, we are depends on the product deploying DSPs from different vendors."

If we look back over the year, we\u2019ve consistently had a positive book-to-bill, but we don\u2019t generally report quarter-to-quarter with specific numbers due to the amount of VMI that we have, because it means \u2013 meaningful amount of our shipments are from vendor managed inventory, the book-to-bill doesn\u2019t reflect that."

But Huawei is an interesting and unique position right now with the trade tensions and the geopolitical tensions. We have to be pragmatic and expecting that there will be market share shifts and we\u2019re seeing some of that. And so how that plays out over the longer term is really not possible for us to accurately forecast at the moment.

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, in the way Mike, I think it\u2019s an insightful question, because we have to think about it multiple ways. So, in the first instance, in China, Huawei has a broad portfolio of systems that they\u2019re going to continue to deploy. And to the extent that there are knock-on effects, as you say, and they\u2019re unable to get some parts, then they will be fulfilling customer orders in China with things that they can fulfil. In the international market, it\u2019s a little different situation, because in the international marketplace, there are more competitors with strong market positions. But as I said previously, all of those customers are essentially our customers as well.",
            "So, to the extent that there are market share shifts, things may have a little bit of a delay period, for example. But ultimately if Huawei\u2019s share decreases in the international market, we would expect to be a beneficiary of their \u2013 whoever is gaining the market share from Huawei, we would expect to be supplying to them as well.",
            "Now, in China, we have to look at two effects. The first one is, just what\u2019s happening with Huawei\u2019s supply chain, but in China, as in the rest of the world, we sell to all of the network equipment companies. So to the extent that there are share shifts to other Chinese network equipment providers, we would be in those supply chains too. So, because Huawei has been a significant customer and they have been the largest market shareholder in the industry, and they have been building strategic inventory, they get kind of outsize identification and therefore, they get outsize risk profile. But the fact of the matter is to the extent that there are share shifts in China or outside China, other companies will, and we supply to the other companies as well.

I think, you\u2019ve got as good a pulse on that as anybody and pretty hard for us to read it externally.

The overall demand in China has continued to be, I will say, it\u2019s actually surprisingly strong given the \u2013 what we might otherwise conclude, just from media in the U.S. essentially, China mobile is continuing to do deployments. They are using, as I said, the prepared remarks, they\u2019re deploying using the C++ spectrum. This is where they use a wider spectral width, add more channels, and then they can get, even more capacity with the additional channels on each wavelength than on each fiber. So that is actually going strong. And it also is important to note that that uses among other things our C++ laser product, as well as our 64 Gbaud components. And so it is, while I said that the customers, if you will, three through eight, we\u2019re growing 35% sequentially, is also true that, we have essentially 64 Gbaud revenue streams from the major players in China as well.",

            "And all of these factors are \u2013 they\u2019re identified, but they\u2019re not fully quantified. And so what we\u2019re seeing is continued demand, continued strength in terms of volume. However, our forward visibility is limited to what we actually know and our ability to speculate on what might happen, we don\u2019t have that ability. However, it is also notable given Huawei\u2019s unique situation in the international marketplace and with the entities list, and the limitations on their chip availability, there is expectation for some loss of market share that has two effects. One is that their strategic inventory is relatively larger and we would expect to see increasing backlog and demand forecast from other customers. That\u2019ll play out over the next two quarters."
