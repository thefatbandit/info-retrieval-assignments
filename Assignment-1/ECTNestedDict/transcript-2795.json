            "Hi, good morning, guys. I don\u2019t know if you can hear me, because the voice is breaking up pretty bad on my home. I think two questions. One, can you tell us what\u2019s the mechanism of the $1.5 billion debt reduction since that you have no maturity? Is it going to be a tender or that you\u2019re just going to buy from the public market?",
            "And secondly, that on the special dividend and why we are not using that money for buyback, given how cheap is the valuation the stock is currently is? Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hi. Yes, this is Jeff. So as it relates to the debt repurchase, the $1.5 billion that we\u2019ve highlighted, our expectation is to do probably a mix between open market and tender. That\u2019s going to be dependent upon market conditions. So we\u2019re going to evaluate the maturities across the curve and where the best value sits. And then we\u2019ll enact that as we work our way through the rest of this year and likely into next year as well.",
            "So it\u2019s likely going to be a mixed bag. We certainly want to see interest reduction \u2013 excuse me, interest costs come down as we\u2019ve highlighted as our new annual run rate, but we also are going to have a focus on reducing absolute leverage. So it\u2019s going to be a balance between the two.",
            "As it relates to the special dividend, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which you all probably could not hear, the feedback from our investors has been incredibly clear. They\u2019re looking for a continuation of cash dividends from the space and specifically from Devon. And so we think with the work that we\u2019ve done around our cost structure, lowering our break-even, we\u2019re uniquely positioned within the sector to provide those cash returns to shareholders.",
            "So it\u2019s really consistent with what we\u2019re hearing from our largest shareholders. And we\u2019re excited to move forward with not only our quarterly dividend, but the potential for variable dividends as we move through the next couple of years and evaluate market conditions."

We\u2019re certainly going to look to do some of that here over the next several months, again, as market conditions allow, and then likely, some of that will move our way into 2021 as well. So, again, it\u2019s going to be a function of the market conditions and what we see with how the debt is trading.",
            "We\u2019re also comfortable holding the cash on the balance sheet to the extent that the value proposition isn\u2019t there. But the key point we want to make is that, that cash is earmarked for debt repayment. So we are absolutely expecting to continue to lower our absolute leverage over time."

In broad buckets, I would tell you that\u2019s equally split between capital efficiencies we\u2019re seeing, particularly in the Wolfcamp, as well as the impact of lower decline rates.",
            "I\u2019d note that a lot of the production outperformance we saw this year has come from the good focus we\u2019ve had on our base production levels and we continue to outperform from a base perspective. So those lower decline rates certainly give us a boost as we think about the maintenance capital we need to drive the business forward. And then the other half would be service cost savings that we believe we have line of sight to here just given the environment we\u2019re in."

Certainly, here, in this part of the cycle from supply-cost perspective, we\u2019ve seen some pretty material reductions. We believe we can capture that. We haven\u2019t baked a lot of that, that we don\u2019t have line of sight to and going forward.

Typically, it\u2019s a routine part of our business. We file for those extensions, say, three months out from when those permits will expire. Typically, it\u2019s a very quick approval process. We\u2019ve never been declined an extension. And importantly, the environmental assessments that underlie those permits are good for a period of fie years."

Dave, you and I have gone backwards and forwards on this model for sometime. I just want to commend you guys for introducing what I think is a really differentiated model, and I\u2019ll be curious to see how this is received by the market.",
            "My question, however, is I wonder if you or Jeff could explain the mechanism by how you intend to share, I\u2019ll use your words from the last call, windfall cash flows with investors."

            "Well, I think \u2013 thanks, Doug, and we\u2019re very proud of the model and we think it is the right business model. And certainly, we feel like we have moved this model quickly and probably as quick as anybody in the industry. And hopefully, others continue to follow it up with actions as we have already started to do here.",
            "I think the first thing to keep in mind is that our break-even is now \u2013 that funds our maintenance capital is around $35 WTI. And then \u2013 and we actually then funded the dividend \u2013 the normal dividend plus our maintenance capital around $39 WTI. So where you start really getting into the issue is, when you start to balance our growth opportunities beyond \u2013 if we\u2019re in an environment above $39 WTI, how do you balance that with the return of free cash flow to shareholders.",
            "And certainly, we\u2019re going to look at the economic climate that we\u2019re in at the time to make that call whether we would undertake select growth opportunities or whether we think it\u2019s better to return that cash to shareholders as we move above that.",
            "As we sit here today, we\u2019re obviously still in the middle of a global pandemic. And so even though the strip is sitting there at currently somewhere right around $45 today, the way I would describe it is there\u2019s a big error bar on that strip. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty associated with that strip at this point and how sustainable that is.",
            "So we are not, at this point, prepared to say, \"Okay, it\u2019s $45 strip. Now we\u2019re going to start going more into growth mode.\u201d Our thought process is more we\u2019re going to stay closer to maintenance capital or at maintenance capital and return those incremental dollars to shareholders. Now there may be an environment in the future where we don\u2019t feel as much risk as there is on oil pricing right now, given the global pandemic that we\u2019re still under.",
            "So there may be at some point where we do start to \u2013 as we get above $40 and towards $45, where we say we\u2019re going to mix in a little bit of growth and with the return to value to shareholders. But we\u2019re going to take into account all the economic conditions at the time on how to best make that judgment.",
            "So it\u2019s not going to be an absolute formula. I think, if you \u2013 inevitably, I think, whenever you try to live by an absolute formula, you will find that the formula doesn\u2019t work as well as you wish it had. And so it\u2019s going to involve some level of business judgment, where our business judgment is right now that we feel it\u2019s more appropriate to fund at maintenance capital level and return at incremental dollars to the shareholder. But that could change at some point in the future."

And I guess, it\u2019s really a question about high-grading inventory. I\u2019m just wondering if the incremental drilling activity sees another upward reset in productivity and capital efficiency, because you\u2019re obviously slowing down the activity level as well? I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you."

      "26": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, I think, you can look for us to continue to drive more capital efficiency into the business in general. You\u2019re seeing how we\u2019re continuing to drive down the drilling and completion costs and improve the capital efficiency in the Delaware Basin. You can \u2013 if you look at the stack play, we\u2019ve done a couple of things there, where we have really redesigned our wells. And when we go back out there, that we feel that we\u2019re going to be drilling and completing those wells for significantly less than when the last time we were out there.",
            "In addition, we did the transaction with Dow, where we brought in promoted capital, where essentially we\u2019ll be paying one-third of our costs in a given well for 50% of our working interest. So that is certainly going to drive capital efficiency. Eagle Ford, we work very closely with BP to drive the efficiency there and really the economics on the remaining development inventory, as well as the redevelopment opportunities we\u2019re seeing are very capital efficient.",
            "And finally, we\u2019re learning an awfully lot about the Powder River Basin, particularly in the Niobrara. And we have really just been in appraisal mode up there so far. So as we go into full development in the Powder River Basin, you will see those well costs potentially move down dramatically as well.",
            "So absolutely, we\u2019ll be \u2013 in a sense, we\u2019ll be high grading by drilling the best opportunities. But all of these opportunities are going to continue to improve because of the measures that we have been executing on internally."

So I just want to make sure clear. Is there a certain level you want to get debt down to and sort of a certain minimum level of production growth you would like before sort of considering these more frequent variable dividends, or how should we think about that?"

            "On the variable dividend, so I tried to lay out that it\u2019s going to depend somewhat on our perception of the economic outlook as to how much we want and our confidence in forward pricing as to how much we would just return cash to shareholders versus invest in a limited amount of growth opportunities up to 5%.",

It may prove better, but we\u2019re still in the middle of a pandemic, so there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around it. So we\u2019d be leaning more towards the cash return side of it right now, so."

But I\u2019m just thinking when \u2013 if the strip does get up to a certain point where you have more confidence behind that, would the focus essentially still initially just be Delaware, or would you continue \u2013 would you start looking more at the Eagle Ford, Powder, Anadarko, et cetera?"

But the 70% to 80% target for CapEx to cash flow, you mentioned this is at a mid-cycle price. What mid-cycle price are you using?

So that reinvestment ratio that we talked about the 70% to 80%, it obviously really kicks in when you get to those sorts of levels. Prior to that, again, as Dave has articulated, we\u2019re going to be focused on the maintenance capital and generating free cash flow and returning that to shareholders.",

In maintenance mode, it looks like you\u2019ve mitigated a significant amount of risk in the Delaware through a lot of good forward permitting.

Certainly, as you think about the core in Lea and Eddy County, that\u2019s where some of our highest return opportunities are. And so that\u2019s why we wanted to highlight, from a permitting standpoint, of those 400 or so permits that we expect to have by the fall in the Delaware, about half of those include our drilling program for the next two years.",

Some of that, of course, is the benefit of the deflation that we\u2019ve seen here lately. But what we\u2019re really seeing from the teams is an ability to lock some of that in and, again, we believe keep those lower cost sustainable into the future.",

We\u2019ve got our decision support centers that feed us data on our operations on a real-time basis.",

It varies a little bit by area how we attack the line items just given the nature of the different assets.",

In the Rockies, we\u2019re doing \u2013 we\u2019re piloting some additional technology opportunities to automate the way we work.",

So we believe there\u2019s a step change there that we can continue to get.",

There\u2019s too much overhead sitting in the entire E&P system. And to the extent that which there can be some consolidation and eliminate some of that overhead and also, in many cases, capture operational synergies that may exist between various companies, there could be some benefit there.",

I think, frankly, many of the companies are pivoting to the same model that we are. I think we\u2019re just a little more advanced with the implementation of this model than they are.",

And just on the \u2013 I gave the very quick answer, one-word answer, yes, on limited to 5% growth rate. I mean, that is absolutely the answer. The rationale behind that, I think, we all understand is that, why does it \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t make any sense for our industry to grow at a much higher rate than the demand for the product is, and we count on OPEC to cut supplies to bail us out on prices.",
            "And so I think, hopefully, everyone is learning their lesson on that. And I think \u2013 and frankly, I think, the industry is learning their lesson on that. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s just so straightforward for us to answer it the way I did."

I think, as we roll forward a year, we would expect that, that oil decline rate moves to the low-30s and on a BOE basis into the mid-20s or so.",

If you have any other further questions as well, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team at any time. Thank you, and have a good day."
