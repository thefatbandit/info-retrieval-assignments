         "Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy during the pandemic. Let me begin with some high level summary comments on the quarter. All comparisons are to the second quarter of 2019, unless otherwise stated. Overall Sherwin-Williams delivered a very good second quarter given the environment. Total company consolidated sales were in line with the updated guidance we provided on June 22 with sequential improvement in each month of the quarter. Despite sales being down for the quarter, we delivered year-over-year improvement in gross margin, profit before tax, EBITDA, diluted net income per share and net operating cash.",
         "Second quarter 2020 consolidated sales decreased 5.6% to $4.6 billion, inclusive of negative currency impact of negative 1.5%. The estimated negative impact from COVID-19 on consolidated sales was approximately 8%. Consolidated gross margin increased 330 basis points to 48% from 44.7%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $71.7 million or 10.6% to $747.4 million. Diluted net income per share increased 28.8% to $6.48 per share from $5.03 per share.",
         "The second quarter of 2020 included acquisition related amortization expense of $0.62 per share. The second quarter of 2019 included acquisition related amortization expense and other adjustments of $1.54 per share. As described in the Regulation G reconciliation table included in our press release. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.1% to $7.10 from $6.57. Adjusted EBITDA increased $57.5 million to $979 million or 21.3% of sales. Net operating cash increased 42% year-to-date to $1.07 billion or 12.3% of sales.",
         "Segments sales were also in line with the updated guidance we provided on June 22. Segment margin in The Americas Group improved to 23.8% of sales, driven by favorable customer and product mix, lower input costs and reduced spending. Adjusted segment margin in the consumer brands group increased to 26.5% of sales, resulting from operating leverage on the nearly 22% top line growth and lower input costs, as well as actions taken over the past year to improve our international operating margins. Adjusted segment margin in the Performance Coatings Group decreased to 13.6% of sales, where lower input costs and good spending control were able to offset some, but not all of the impact of the high teens sales decline. Additional details on our segment performance are included in the slide deck provided with our press release and available on our website.",
         "Let me now turn the call over to John Morikis, for some additional commentary on the quarter and our outlook. John?"
      ],
      "John Morikis": [
         "Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Let me begin by thanking the more than 60,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams for their continued determination and resilience under very challenging circumstances. As I mentioned on our last call, our senior leaders have persevered through several previous crises. Their experience has been a true differentiator during this time and enabled us to deliver significant improvement across many measures in the quarter. Our entire team has my appreciation and respect, as they continue to serve our customers at a high level.",
         "The quarter played out better than we anticipated with the pace of year-over-year decline decreasing sequentially throughout the quarter. Consolidated sales were down by a mid teens percentage in April, but came out of the quarter with June flat to last year. The pace of recovery was faster than expected in some end markets, which led us to revise our sales guidance on June 22. As Jim mentioned, gross margin in the quarter expanded to 48%, driven by favorable customer and product mix and lower input costs. The industry basket of raw materials was down by mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter compared to the prior year. In terms of cost control, our team quickly developed and began implementing a comprehensive contingency plan in March to adjust to the pandemic. We reduced the SG&A spending in the quarter by $40 million, but also maintain strategic investments to support long-term growth.",
         "Let me talk a bit about trends we\u2019re seeing in each of our segments before moving on to our outlook. In The Americas Group, we\u2019re now into the summer painting season and no one is better positioned to serve professional painters than we are. We\u2019ve safely and responsibly opened all our store sales force in the U.S. and Canada and customers in all segments tell us they\u2019re eager to get back to work. Last quarter, we commented that we believed that we were seeing a pause in demand rather than demand destruction. We still believe this is the case based on the momentum we saw in multiple segments as the quarter progressed.",
         "While we don\u2019t typically comment on the pace of business by month, I would like to provide a few data points that maybe helpful given the current extraordinary circumstances. In DIY our business continued to grow at an unprecedented pace and was robust throughout the quarter. After DIY, new residential and residential repaint were the best performers in the quarter and both recovered to deliver positive growth in June. Commercial improved in each month of the quarter and was down slightly in June. Property maintenance and protective and marine also improved sequentially, but have not yet returned to grow.",
         "From a product perspective, exterior paint is recovering faster than interior paint, as you would expect due to social distancing requirements. Exterior paint sales increased by mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter and with June being the strongest month in the quarter. The interior paint sales decreased by low-single-digit percentage in the quarter, but improved throughout the quarter, finishing June flat to last year. Additionally, spray equipment pump sales are often a good indicator of future demand as contractors are unlikely to invest in this type of equipment, unless they anticipate significant future demand. Spray equipment and pump sales were down mid single digits in the quarter, but recovered to finish strong in the month of June.",
         "Pricing came in as we expected and was approximately 2% in the second quarter. We expect a similar level of effectiveness in the third quarter. We still anticipate opening approximately 50 new stores this year, while continuing to focus on adding sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products and productivity enhancing services. We also continue to invest in our e-commerce platform and we\u2019re pleased with the continuing uptick in usage.",
         "Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. DIY demand surged throughout the quarter, driven by consumers nesting and tackling home improvement projects during the pandemic. We generated strong double-digit growth by working closely with our retail customers to capture this demand, most notably Lowe\u2019s, our exclusive national home center partner. Our global supply chain organization continued to adapt and invest during the quarter, including pivoting from 5 gallon pails to single gallon cans on multiple production lines to help meet the unprecedented DIY demand. Internationally, we saw positive growth in Europe, while China and Australia remained soft.",
         "We leveraged the strong sales growth to drive significant operating margin improvement compared to the prior year. Our margin improvement also reflects the benefit of actions taken over the past year to focus our portfolio, including rationalizing SKUs, exiting the ACE private label business, streamlining our European business, and reducing costs in Asia and Australia. This enhanced profitability will enable us to reinvest in the business to drive long-term growth for our retail partners, especially in the Handyman remodeler, pros who paint category.",
         "Lastly, let me comment on the trends in the Performance Coatings Group. Demand improved sequentially across the group in the quarter, though the pace of improvement remained variable by geography and business unit. From a geographic perspective, Asia was the strongest performer in the quarter, down by a low-single-digit percentage. All other regions were down by double-digit percentages, though North America was significantly better than Europe and Latin America. In packaging, sales were positive in every region for the quarter and were up a high-single-digit percentage. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust.",
         "In coil coatings, the resumption of selected commercial construction projects drove sequential improvements during the quarter, including exiting the quarter positively in June. This improvement aligns with my earlier comments on commercial construction within the TAG segment, which improved sequentially in the quarter. In industrial wood, we saw sequential sales improvement during the quarter. Many of the end markets served by this business including furniture, kitchen cabinetry and flooring are influenced by trends in new residential construction, which has gained momentum in our TAG business as I mentioned earlier.",
         "In general industrial, most end markets including heavy equipment, agriculture, transportation and general finishing, remained soft, though the business did improve sequentially. Encouragingly, general industrial was up high-single digits in Asia for the quarter. All other regions were down double-digit percentages in the quarter. In automotive refinish, miles driven and traffic congestion remain at reduced levels. We saw sequential improvement in the business during the quarter, though a return to growth continues to depend on the lifting of stay-at-home orders and the resumption of more normal travel routines.",
         "Certainly, the pandemic is not over, and numerous uncertainties in the economic environment remain. However, to the extent that economies are beginning to shift from the containment phase to the recovery phase of the pandemic, our team is energized and engaged to capture current opportunities and deliver above market growth. We anticipate third quarter demand to improve sequentially from the second quarter but softness to continue in some end markets in the U.S., and internationally for the remainder of 2020.",
         "Against this backdrop, we anticipate third quarter 2020 consolidated net sales will be up or down by a low-single-digit percentage versus the third quarter of 2019. Looking at our operating segments for the third quarter, we anticipate The Americas Group to be flat to up by a low-single digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up a low-double digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be down by low to mid-single digit percentage.",
         "For the full year 2020, we\u2019re revising our sales guidance upward modestly to approximately flat with last year. This guidance reflects continued uncertainties in the timing and pace of improvement in the U.S. and global operating environments. On an operating segment basis for the full year, we anticipate The Americas Group to be flat to up by a low-single-digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up by a high-single-digit percentage, and Performance Coatings Group to be down by a low to mid-single-digit percentage.",
         "We are revising our diluted net income per share guidance for 2020 to be in the range of $19.21 to $20.71 per share compared to our previous guidance of $16.46 to $18.46 per share, and compared to $16.49 per share earned in 2019. Full year 2020 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $2.54 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2020 earnings per share of $21.75 to $23.25, an increase of 6.5% at the midpoint over the $21.12 we delivered last year.",
         "Embedded within our outlook is the assumption that the industry raw material basket will be lower for the full year by a mid-single digit percentage. Based on our current outlook, we expect the second quarter will be the most beneficial in terms of year-over-year deflation. We expect the second half benefit will be less than the first half benefit, given comparisons to the deflation we saw in the back half of 2019.",
         "Let me close with some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remains the strength of the company. At June 30, 2020, we had $188 million in cash, and approximately $3 billion of unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities. Our leverage ratio improved to 2.8 times on total debt to adjusted EBITDA compared to 3.3 times a year ago.",
         "Given the improving sequential demand we are seeing in several end markets, we\u2019re raising our CapEx guidance for the year from $180 million to $280 million. This is largely related to architectural and packaging capacity expansions restarting. This CapEx guidance includes a minimal amount of spending related to our new headquarters and R&D facility project. Earlier this month, the company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $1.34 per share, an increase of 18.6% over the $1.13 per share dividend paid in the second quarter of 2019. We are committed to maintain this dividend increase throughout the rest of 2020.",
         "In May, we paid off $429 million in 2.25% notes that were due. Our next long-term debt maturity is $25 million due in 2021, followed by $660 million due in 2022. We paused open market share purchases during the second quarter, believing it inappropriate to be buying shares at a time when we were forced to adjust our workforce and pause multiple spending programs. Again, given a stabilizing environment, we would expect to return to repurchases in the second half of the year, with a minimum goal of offsetting dilution from options.",
         "As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have a long tenured and experienced management team that has successfully managed the company through many challenging times. They have demonstrated this ability once again over the last several months, and I\u2019m confident they will continue to deliver strong results. We also believe the long-term fundamental strengths of our end markets remain intact. We have the people, the products and the services to help our customers succeed. We remain very confident about the future and our ability to create shareholder value over the long-term.",
         "That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions."

            "Thank you. So, you seem to have some pretty solid margin results, especially in Consumer. I wish \u2013 I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a testament to a few different variables, but primarily the amount of volumes just moving through the system and leveraging what you\u2019ve been refining as your U.S. cost base. You\u2019ve often spoken about 20% annualized margins in Consumer Brands from 13% level to time of the Valspar acquisition. Can you update us on your long-term thoughts on this target and what you\u2019ve learned further about this platform in a COVID-19 environment? Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hey, Chris, this is Al Mistysyn. Hope you\u2019re doing well. Yes, I think we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making on operating margin within Consumer Brand. I think you\u2019re right; it\u2019s too soon to come off our long-term margin target of that 20% range. As we\u2019ve always talked about, volume is the single biggest driver of leverage across all our businesses. And with the unprecedented surge we\u2019re seeing in DIY across all channels, that is absolutely driving the majority of the margin improvement. And you would expect, and we expect that the demand will return to more normalized levels as the year progresses.",
            "That being said, there absolutely is good cost control taking place in North America. As you recall, we exited the ACE business last year. That helped improve our gross margin, our operating margin. We took action to reduce our footprint and costs around that. And we\u2019ve also taken action, as John talked about in his opening remarks, on our international businesses. We\u2019ve commented before, the performance of those businesses haven\u2019t been up to what we expect. I think the team has done a nice job with a variety of things; pricing actions, SKU rationalizations to make those operations more efficient, cost reductions and even in \u2013 we talked about the European flow through. In our first quarter we saw a nice similar improvement in flow through on our second quarter, and then even in Asia and Australia where we saw sales backwards, we\u2019re still positive on profit. So there\u2019s a number of factors that are allowing us to drive these margins, but volume is always first."

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. And Chris, I would just add a couple of other items. One is, I do think we\u2019re operating more efficiently this year versus last year in serving our customers. I think that\u2019s a tribute to our global supply chain team doing a really terrific job and better planning and execution. We\u2019re more efficient I think this year in serving our customers; we\u2019re optimizing our supply chain better. We\u2019re doing this, I might add, while investing CapEx in areas such as our filling lines and dealing with the COVID challenges that everyone is dealing with. And I\u2019d like to just call out our global supply chain team during this really challenging time, this COVID issue. There\u2019s a team that\u2019s working 24/7 throughout all of this to serve our customers and to help our customers win. So I think we\u2019re being a little more effective in utilizing and optimizing our supply chain.",
            "You also asked about the COVID-19 environment and what we\u2019re learning. And I would say for me, what that\u2019s done is it\u2019s really reinforced the importance of our strategy. We have long spoken about this approach that we\u2019re taking on really driving value for our shareholders by focusing on what\u2019s right, where our customers value our solutions. And the other approach that I\u2019d say is we\u2019re really focused on covering all the bases.",
            "And I think what\u2019s happening right now, you asked about the DIY, is a great example. We\u2019ve got a terrific focus on our residential repaint. But we\u2019ve also been really focused on helping our customers grow DIY. And we take that approach in each of the markets we serve. So, whichever way the table tilts, we want to be first-in-line right there. So if it\u2019s DIY versus res repaint, if it\u2019s new residential versus remodeling, if it\u2019s commercial \u2013 new versus commercial repaint or whatever segment pops up, we want to be number one there."

         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And the second question that I have is just it does appear that you have some potential emerging I would characterize them as structural tailwinds in both resi repaint and likely new resi, based on what some of your customers are talking about for the second half, but probably more importantly for 2021. Can you just update us on your general housing views? Any comments on reverse urbanization? And just your efforts to accelerate share gains? And if you could sneak in a comment also about how that\u2019s playing into your intermediate to long-term outlook versus the non-resi and protective fronts, which look a little less bullish, that would greatly be appreciated. Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "No. It\u2019s good. It\u2019s good. We love it. Let me start with the res repaint. We did see sequential improvement in the quarter. It turned positive in June largely driven by the exteriors that we talked about. We do see customers delaying interior work, that\u2019s related to the COVID-19 as you would expect. It\u2019s very uncommon to hear of projects that have been canceled, so we expect the interior to return, albeit probably gradually. To your point about our share gains there in res repaint, it is an area of focus. We are very pleased with the performance and we\u2019ve been talking quite a while about this idea of new accounts and share of wallet. And we\u2019re really trying to drive this. And we\u2019re really trying to bring more solutions to our customers right now than ever before.",
            "And this is an environment where our solutions add value. Complexity and challenges that our customers face, they allow us to demonstrate our solutions. And we are we believe uniquely positioned to help our customers to deliver. They want high quality projects. They want product on time. They want it efficiently. And they want to make more money. And we help them do that. And I believe when you dial it down, and there\u2019s a lot of detail into it, but if you look at it, I think it\u2019s \u2013 our stores are where they\u2019re needed, our products are where they\u2019re needed, our innovation is where it\u2019s needed. Our people are trained, they\u2019re knowledgeable. We hire the best. We do everything we can to keep them.",
            "Our voluntary turnover is in single digits, so we\u2019ve built these terrific relationships with customers and we work really hard to make them successful. And while these customers are experiencing delays or new regulations, if it\u2019s COVID or just emotions that they\u2019re dealing with customers, there\u2019s no room for errors, no room for disruptions. And our stores and our reps and those relationships help us tremendously.",
            "As it relates to commercial, I would say we saw sequential improvement in the second quarter, the pace of recovery, I would say has been more muted than the residential side. Projects have started to reopen and may have some limitations to them as our contractors are learning to work with social distancing and the limits around them of how many workers can be on a project and its slowing efficiency for our contractors.",
            "As a reminder I might say that new commercial starts are typically painted 12 to 18 months after the ground is broken. So we\u2019ve got a little runway here. But as far as we see, this is again a terrific opportunity. These are contractors who \u2013 these are typically very large projects. They\u2019re bid projects so they\u2019re competitive and these customers; they don\u2019t want delays or problems. And they learn to lean on our teams to be able to run their project successfully. Trend wise, I would say that the \u2013 when you look at the Architectural Billings Index, it\u2019s improved sequentially. In May, it was 32. It\u2019s now in June up to 40, still below the 50 expansion threshold that shows it\u2019s growing. But we remain pretty optimistic about this. It\u2019s \u2013 particularly in the area of new construction. While our customers are challenged, we think that it\u2019s a terrific way for us to be able to demonstrate what it is that we do and why it\u2019s special.",
            "And the last thing I would say is we\u2019re working really, really hard here in the area of specifications both in product and color. And that\u2019s an important metric that we monitor. So we actually gauge. When we talk with you folks about why we have confidence and we do, it\u2019s driven by the number of color requests we get, the number of data sheets and information we get. We monitor all of that. And the pipeline looks very good to us. So we\u2019re feeling good about our position, feeling good about what our customers are telling us, and we\u2019re really feeling good about the ability of our people to be able to deliver for them.",
            "What was the last one you talked about? The protective and marine or the industrial side. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve seen \u2013 we\u2019ve seen sequential improvement during the quarter. It\u2019s not returned back into year-over-year growth. Protective and marine, about 40% of our sales are tied to oil and gas, and that\u2019s obviously fallen sharply over the last quarter. Major oil and gas companies have delayed CapEx projects, which will continue to impact our results. But these aren\u2019t decorative products that we\u2019re talking about \u2013 or projects, I mean that we\u2019re talking about. They\u2019re most often very corrosive environments and they require corrosion control to protect the assets and protect safety of the employees and those around it as well as the environment.",
            "So we\u2019re focused on that business to continue to grow, there\u2019s still penetration opportunities. We\u2019re also focused on other areas like water, waste water, the flooring, the rail and we\u2019re gaining very good ground there. But given the weight that we have in the oil and gas, we expect while we\u2019re gaining in some of these other segments, we would expect to see meaningful growth what\u2019s most likely beginning in 2021 in protective and marine."

But we churn our raw materials so quickly, especially in this kind of environment on the architectural side with DIY, it\u2019s not meaningful in that respect because of the turns that we get. The just-in-time inventory that our suppliers do a great job keeping up with us and this environment, with the DIY surge that we talked about, a lot of impact on gallon cans and other specific raw materials related to that. So it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re churning our inventories very quickly on raw materials."

In that year-over-year, maybe your sales are down $275 million and your gross profits are flat to up, and your gross margin is up about 300 basis points. And even versus the first quarter, maybe your incremental gross margin is 70%. What was the thing \u2013 was it really volume in the Consumer Brands business or like what unusual thing happened in the second quarter so you have your cost of goods sold down, I don\u2019t know 10% or 11% year-over-year?"

            "Right. No, Jeff, I think there\u2019s a number of things that are occurring in our second quarter that give us a tailwind. You bring up \u2013 you talk about the volume through our Consumer Brands Group that we just talked about on the previous question with Chris. When you see that kind of volume, and in our first quarter, we also talked about customer and mix change. And that\u2019s across really each of the segments. In some respects, you got TAG that we talked about with DIY and res repaint performing better than the other segments. We talked about from a product standpoint exterior growing faster than interior, paint growing faster than non-paint.",
            "I talked about the exiting of the ACE business that as you know it was a drag on our gross margin. That helps. And then we did see \u2013 as John talked about in the opening comments, lower raw material costs. And we expected to see that in our second quarter with the way raw materials trended last year and with our second quarter likely being our biggest year-over-year change.",
            "And then even \u2013 I would say, even within our Performance Coatings Group with the different segment growths and the different region growths, there\u2019s a mix there that helps. And then finally, as TAG performs better than Performance Coatings, that segment mix gives you some lift. So it\u2019s really a combination of a number of those things happening. But I would say with PCG, for example, the consumer businesses outside of the U.S., this is hard work being done over the past year to get us in line for whatever happens. And when volume comes back, I would expect to see both of those areas even improve faster."

Our teams have adapted I would say, Ghansham, decisively and quickly. But the surge was significant, and it\u2019s created some challenges. We\u2019re uniquely positioned, I think, at Sherwin-Williams to utilize assets that others might not have. And I would tell you we\u2019re pulling every lever possible. We\u2019re determined. But I would say that we\u2019re still chasing. We believe that we\u2019ll be in a position to begin building inventory again as we come out of the third quarter, going into the fourth quarter, into the first quarter. But right now, we\u2019re focused on meeting demand.",
            "And again I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t call out this terrific effort by the global supply chain team with everything they\u2019re doing in this environment, but also the ability to work with our customers. These are unprecedented times, not only for us, but also our customers. So the better line of sight that we have to be able to isolate in on what are the most important skews and working with them to deliver is really what we\u2019re after. And this is a new experience. We\u2019ll come out of this better. And we\u2019ll likely sit with our customers at the end of the year and talk about inventory levels as we begin next season. And if we need to step up and put more in inventory to serve our customers, we\u2019re going to take care of our customers.",
            "As it relates to DIY, I think fatigue as you mentioned it, we don\u2019t support that attitude by any customer, by the way. Reality is that we find that the more customers are home, more \u2013 and different customers are coming in. And in our stores, it\u2019s often referred to as it\u2019s a COVID project, where people have been in their home for some time and they might have a bedroom that they\u2019ve never really considered repainting. And they realize that it\u2019s very affordable and highly impactful project. And they tackle it. The beauty of it is, is that what we\u2019re finding is very little overlap from customers coming in. And while I\u2019m sure there are some, but it seems to be very little where customers are talking about this was a project that I was going to have a contractor do and I\u2019m going to tackle it myself.",
            "These are what we\u2019re getting from our customers in our stores are customers that are looking at a wall that\u2019s probably not been painted, likely wouldn\u2019t have been painted, and they\u2019re painting them. And so through our stores, it\u2019s a relatively small percentage. There\u2019s a nice gain. It\u2019s only 10% sales through our stores. But through our retail partners we\u2019re doing everything we can to make that an easy experience so that it\u2019s not just one project. We want it to be easy. Your question is, do they have fatigue? We want to make it a wonderful experience so it\u2019s an easy, impactful experience that they went through seamlessly and they want to do more. And we\u2019re working with our retail customers to capture those customers and make them repeat customers going forward."

It\u2019s not only an investment in inventory that we\u2019re doing, I think our global supply chain has come up with a number of creative solutions to expand capacity of the key product lines where we\u2019re chasing demand. And that\u2019s everything from investing in capital to retrofit 5 gallon lines which are predominantly pro to gallon lines as John talked about in the opening remarks. It\u2019s finding where we may have capacity in industrial sites that have the ability to make an exterior stain product line and ramping that quality process up and to make sure we\u2019re providing the right quality and the right process but doing it quickly to try to improve our filling rates across all the different channels. So it\u2019s not just investments in inventory, we\u2019re looking at all areas to expand our capacity."

So I was wondering, is there anything in particular to your business the cities you serve, the routes to market that would make it different and sort of what are your prospects there given that we hope maybe that the lockdown ending sooner there you would see a sooner response.

We think that that\u2019s a slower recovery in the architectural business there. But again, it\u2019s really a very, very small piece of our business.",

We\u2019ve got a couple of really good tests going on right now that have gotten a little cloudy with everything that\u2019s been going on, on different aspects of our business, so.

So I mean we see that momentum moving in the right direction. Not sure if there\u2019s going be an air pocket or a gap, if it does happen or when it will happen. What we\u2019re doing, Bob, we\u2019re working really hard right now to minimize any impact. We call it \u2013 I call it a pothole. We\u2019re driving down the road here. We\u2019re doing everything we can to fill that pothole. And the beauty of our model, the direct model, is that we can control that.",

We\u2019re attacking this. We know the specifications. We\u2019re trying to get more products specified. We know those projects. We know the painting contractors that are on those commercial projects. And we\u2019re leveraging our strategy, and we\u2019re capitalizing on the segments that we offer to offset whatever might be coming down the road. So I\u2019d say no one\u2019s positioned like we are to capitalize on these opportunities.",

Depending on what it looks like if there\u2019s a gap or not and how much there is, we\u2019ll find out if we experience one.

For the year, we\u2019ve opened 16 new stores in North America. And that\u2019s offset by the closure of about 33 stores. 24 of those were in Latin America, nine in North America. Steve, the way I\u2019d point to the Latin America closures were these were underperforming stores in persistently soft markets. That\u2019s the way I would characterize those. The nine in North America that were closed were mainly stores in Canada that were underperforming. And we did have some stores in North America with lease expirations that we\u2019ll plan to relocate. We do expect to open 50 new stores this year, down from our originally planned 80 to 100 due to the COVID. But you should expect us to ramp back up into that 80 to 100 going forward."

On the raw material side, we\u2019ve talked about ROS moderating. It\u2019s less of an impact on our architectural businesses, but it is still helping in pricing. We went out with a 3% to 4% price increase to offset other inflationary items, whether it\u2019s wages, healthcare, and the like, and that price increase is performing as expected and its effectiveness of around 2%. And then the last thing, I would say is, the team did a really nice job pivoting and really reducing discretionary spending, cutting travel very rapidly, and our SG&A was even down year-over-year, so all those helped drive that operating margin higher."

One is, we\u2019re going up against a strong third quarter in TAG of last year. Same-store sales were up in North America a little over 8%. They had strong operating leverage on those sales. And so we\u2019re going to go up against a pretty tough quarter. We\u2019re going to start investing back in the business, as John talked about, the advertising and merchandising that we paused is going to come into our third quarter, but we also expect to see better volume.",
            "As we talked about, same-store sales were down in the second quarter, 6.9%, our forecast right now in the third quarter for sales to be flat to up low-single-digits. And as we talked about, the better volumes we can put through our North America stores and the chain, the better leverage we get. So, whether we see sequential margin improvement will depend on where that volume comes in. If it\u2019s at the higher end of our range, we have a shot at getting sequential improvement. If not, it\u2019s going be difficult to get there. And then, year-over-year, the way ROS kind of have unfolded through last year and into this year and the product mix benefit I still expect to get in the third quarter, year-over-year, I do expect to see some modest improvement."

What we saw in our second quarter, the industry basket of ROS was down by mid-single-digits year-over-year and that was really driven by resins and solvents, and we don\u2019t provide the specific dollars in the quarter, but you can see that positive trend reflected in our year-over-year gross margin improvement. If we look at our outlook kind of going forward, our second quarter we expect will probably be the biggest benefit year-over-year.",
            "We still will see \u2013 and that\u2019s really because we\u2019re going to see tougher comparisons in the second half of the year. We do expect that the second half raw material basket will be down by mid-single-digit percentage overall, similar to the first half. And as Al mentioned a moment ago, it\u2019s a little more heavily weighted towards the industrial part of our business than \u2013 the benefit will be a little more there than on the architectural side. So for the full year, we\u2019re going to be down mid-single-digits or that\u2019s the expectation on ROS and that\u2019s compared to our \u2013 earlier this year, we said it would be down low single. So we\u2019re seeing some good benefit there again driven by resins and solvents.",
            "If you look at the petrochem side of the basket, we\u2019re seeing lower year-over-year propylene and ethylene pricing. More recently though what I would say is we\u2019ve seen a little bit of a sequential tick up in ethylene and propylene contracts and we\u2019ll see how that plays out as the year goes forward. On the TiO2 side of the basket, we\u2019re still anticipating stable pricing trends in the back half. Some of the third-party forecast that we look at are reflecting a little bit more economic resiliency than some of the prior forecasts, sustained by the DIY demand. I would say the North American TiO2 market has been the most stable and we have seen some indications of lower sulfate TiO2 pricing internationally. But as you know, the majority of our TiO2 buy is chloride-based TiO2, which we really haven\u2019t seen movement there. So to sum that up, again, we\u2019re going to \u2013 similar kind of in the back half, down mid-single-digits on the ROS basket led by the resins and solvent piece."

And as far as a price increase, like we always do, we\u2019ll try to manage our costs first and we\u2019ll look at it as the second half unfolds and decide if an increase is needed based on the current environment, but we\u2019re not expecting an increase in our second half."

First on the gross margins, if I heard all this and pieced it together correctly, it sounds like the 330 bps expansion was roughly split between raw material price gap versus mix, and the reason the gross margins might be up less year-over-year in the second half is not raw materials per se, because you have the rest of the price increase, but it could be that some of the mix that\u2019s been extreme in the last few months starts to normalize.

The raw materials is a tailwind, but not as big of a tailwind in the second quarter. I guess, you know what, Greg, the way I would kind of gauge the DIY in the product mix is, if you look at our second and third quarters together between product and customer mix, I estimate a little bit below 1% of an impact, so you\u2019re directionally right there."

The idea here is pretty simple, it allows customers more efficiency in not only ordering products, but also in communicating with their reps and their store managers, and we want to build on this incredible relationship that we enjoy. These contractors as well as now a growing number of DIY customers are learning to rely on our people.",

So, I might describe it as the last mile just got made that much easier, and we want the contractor feeling like they\u2019re part of our team and we\u2019re part of their team. And earlier, I talked about the complexity and the challenges that they\u2019re facing right now and the inability to absorb delays and run profitable efficient projects.",

As it relates to the DIY side, we clearly have experienced a number of new customers using this platform on the DIY side. Our scores there are going up dramatically and it\u2019s working quite well. We\u2019re investing here heavily, because we believe this is another great opportunity for differentiation."

But what we also have to take into consideration is an aging demographic, home price appreciation, aging housing starts. In the last recession to your point, the DIY grew, but not huge amounts and it wasn\u2019t protracted. So, we think that there are some shifts that occur during these times while people are home, as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s affordable, it\u2019s impactful, and you can make a difference. But overall, every time we\u2019ve seen this and we expect it going forward. And quite frankly, another stat that I didn\u2019t share earlier, I shared it maybe in the comments about the res repaint. The reason I say this with confidence, we \u2013 listening to our customers, they\u2019re telling us in June of 2020, they have more bids going out than they had in June of 2019.

And they\u2019re giving us access, they\u2019re allowing our teams to work with their teams, and we believe that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity ahead of us. We\u2019re on a runway and we\u2019re screaming down it. But I think together, there\u2019s a lot more that we can do and we\u2019re looking forward to that. I think these are two wonderful organizations that work together can do a lot.",

As we saw the sales trends come through the second quarter, we restarted those expansion plans, just because they could take 12 months to 16 months to get an expansion of good \u2013 a sizable expansion in place and that takes our CapEx up to $280 million which is still about 1.5% of sales. So, as long as \u2013 I think we\u2019re trying to control CapEx below that 2%, we\u2019ve done that pretty much over the last few years and we\u2019ll continue to do that.

We are experiencing more customers penetrating the home in the interior, but it\u2019s still spotty. And I would tell you that the bids that I mentioned earlier have a lot of people feeling really good on the contractor side, because they\u2019re not just exterior bids that they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re doing both bidding for interior and exterior. So, I think it\u2019s just a matter of time and it\u2019s starting to roll in and our customers are feeling good, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just going be a light switch that\u2019s going to come back online."

The demand surge and the trends that we\u2019re seeing and the product mix, customer mix, we talked about these being shorter term. We\u2019ll get through \u2013 we expect to get the positive trends through this quarter, but go back to some more normalized levels. And then, I think we\u2019ve got to see how the recovery in our Performance Coatings comes out to say \u2013 before we\u2019re ready to say we think we should move that long-term target up. I think we\u2019ve done a lot of work through our different segments, through our different divisions and regions to really drive complexity out of our supply chain and be more efficient, and those will pay off when demand and volume start to pick up again, but I\u2019m just not ready to raise that target just yet."

And you mentioned it, if the DIY surge continues longer than we expect, again, we expect to get a nice operating leverage there. And then, our Performance Coatings Group, the trends that John talked about sequentially through the second quarter, if some of those pick up faster, whether it\u2019s auto refinish, GI, industrial wood, which are probably on the farther end of the scale of where we think \u2013 let me rephrase that, auto refinish more in the middle, GI and industrial wood at the longer end of the scale of recovery, if those do pick up back quicker, yes, I think we can see ourselves to the high end of that range."

You\u2019re often grown in the 1.5 to 2 times market rate, it seems like you\u2019re poised to increase that now maybe to 2 or 3 times the market rate.

            "And quite frankly, a general focus on life, the quality of life and people enjoy the benefit and the impact of a newly painted room or home, and not all of them enjoy doing it themselves, but it\u2019s a relatively inexpensive but impactful experience. And we don\u2019t quite frankly care how it\u2019s applied. We just want to make sure it\u2019s our product going on, and it could be a do-it-yourselfer or it could be a do-it-for-me, it could be \u2013 and we talked about remodel or new home. We just \u2013 we have teams focused on every square field, every corner of the room. We just want to be there when that gallon is sold and be the one that\u2019s providing that solution."

Normally your second half is always a much stronger quarter \u2013 or excuse me, half and you tend to see about 70% of your free cash at least in the last few years in the back half. I guess given the strength that you saw in the second quarter, should we still be assuming that or is it a little bit more of a wonky kind of year where maybe the front end has a little bit more than normal? How should we be thinking about that?"

Our working capital is lower in our first half. As John talked about, we\u2019re going to start building inventory coming out of our third quarter into our fourth quarter and that will be a little bit of a headwind in our second half as far as cash is concerned. And then, the profitability that we saw in the first half, because of the tougher comp in the second half and some of the product and customer mix and things I talked about earlier, you just aren\u2019t going see a big of an improvement when you look at our full year guidance. But we\u2019re going to build inventory and that\u2019s going to be a little bit of a drag on our cash in the second half. It still should be positive year-over-year, but not quite as positive."

We have a terrific and unique technology in our V70 coating that continues to win and convert new customers, new lines, and it\u2019s because of the flexibility, the speed, the ease of application, our customers are running more efficiently through the plans to be able to do that.

But I\u2019ve spoken with a number of contractors who have mentioned that it\u2019s difficult for them to find people, qualified people that are willing to work, given the unemployment rates that they\u2019re receiving. So, it is an issue. I would say to your question about the trend, many of our builders \u2013 first, we do see it, largely because of our position in the market.",
            "We\u2019ve got a terrific position in the national homebuilders. We\u2019ve talked about having 18 of the top 20 national homebuilders in exclusive relationships and we\u2019ve been making very good penetration in the regional builders. And let me just take a slight detour and say our national account business, outside of just the builder, that our national account business in total across all our U.S. stores platform, the activity there is fantastic.",
            "So we\u2019re really leveraging our platform and really trying to drive the differentiation between us and others. That said, back on the builder, we are clearly enjoying this partnership with our builders. They are experiencing \u2013 many of them have said June was their best month ever. And so, we believe that the quarter bodes well for the future. The other point of differentiation I would make that we\u2019re hearing from our builders is that they continue to reference our ability to offer the services that we provide, both the reps and inventory, close to them as an important lever.",
            "Many of them have asked other suppliers to come visit us here in Cleveland to understand what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re doing it. And I think that when you look at our position, it\u2019s become more pronounced given some of the challenges that some builders have had with disruptions in other categories. For us, it\u2019s terrific business, it\u2019s 5 gallon bucket, so it\u2019s easy to serve us, it doesn\u2019t have an impact on the do-it-yourself business, it allows us to serve them well and we can execute for these national homebuilders across the country like no one else can."

So, the \u2013 I\u2019m trying to give you some color without getting into specific numbers to be truthful with you, but we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it.",

Their customers are interested in having their homes painted. There is a sense of wanting to almost get their place in line. And our customers enjoy that, because it allows them to tackle the exterior which is turning out to be an excellent exterior season for our contractors and they\u2019re enjoying the opportunity that many of these interior projects or these customers are getting in line with the expectation that those homes are going be painted by these same pros."
