         "Good morning. This is Geoff Hedrick. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, current business conditions, and our outlook for the coming year. Joining me is Shahram Askarpour, our President and Relland Winand, our CFO. Before I begin, I would like Rell to read the Safe Harbor message. Thank you.",
         "Thank you Rell. Three years ago, I announced that we would change our approach to the market by focusing only on products in which we had both the performance and technologically driven price advantage. The resulting trending of our operating performance seems to vindicate our change in direction. The third quarter, we experienced a historical strong growth quarter with revenues up 28% quarter-over-quarter and 30% from a year ago. Generating sequential revenue growth in 7 of the last 8 quarters. ",
         "In addition, revenues at this quarter including production deliveries to our newest OEM customer Textron. We are pleased to be supplying Textron, our ThrustSense autothrottle with lifeguard protection. On the new King Air 360 twin turboprop production aircraft. We intend to build on this relationship in our joint pursuit of retrofit and upgrade of the very large fleet of King Air's expanding the number of production aircrafts to include a ThrustSense autothrottle as standard equipment and upgrade existing fleets. ",
         "The company has the industry's first FAA Supplemental Type Certificate for its groundbreaking and patented ThrustSense autothrottle system with lifeguard protection on 10 years 200s and 300s with Rockwell's ProLine 21 avionics. The full regime autothrottle ThrustSense system with lifeguard VMCa protection is available for immediate retrofit and promoted at Textron service centers, as well as all King Air maintenance facilities. ",
         "This slide card feature can offer protection against catastrophic upsets with the loss of an engine if the pilot fails to maintain adequate air speed. Excuse me for a second. In the process, we have overcome and continued to overcome many challenges, most notably the Corona virus pandemic. We remain focused in protecting our employees, partners and customers and remain ever vigilant as to its potential effect on our end markets, supply chain and other aspects of our business.",
         "To this state, the impact has been immaterial. I am extremely proud of our team and their ability to execute in these difficult circumstances. Let me turn it over to Rell for financial details.",
         "Thank you, Shahram. As pleased as I am with the performance for this quarter and the past couple of quarters, we must be very diligent that we keep the pursuit up and our nose to the grindstone as I say, to make sure that we realize the opportunities that have been presented to us. This will require a vigilant--a vigilance in our growing--our growth requirements of personnel and investments in technology. ",
         "You know, we're pleased--we're pleased that we performed as well as we did in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our people in our plant and the things that we did to the plant created a work environment which essentially had zero impact of the--from the pandemic. I'm very proud of the people in this company that made it happen and I'm pleased that our work change in the environment that they are working, so, and focus remains strengthening our organization, opening those new relationships that have been provided to us with some of this technology and further growth in our portfolio, our price for Performance Products. Thank you for your attention today. Please operator, open us up for discussions."

         "Welcome to the Innovative Solutions and Support Third 2020 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants Will be in listen only mode. [Operator Instructions].",
         "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Geoffrey Hedrick, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead."
      ],
      "Relland Winand": [
         "Thank you, Geoff and good morning everyone. I would remind our listeners that certain matters discussed in the conference call today, including new products and operational and financial results for future periods are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, either better or worse than those discussed, including other risks and uncertainties reflected in our company's 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and other public filings. Now I'll turn the call back to Geoff.",
         "Thank you Geoff, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were $6 million, up 30% from a year ago and also up on a sequential basis from $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2020. Growth this quarter was primarily in product revenue. We also had some engineering development revenue associated with final engineering on the F5 development contract, while customer service revenue was down from a year ago, mainly due to our prioritization of resource allocation.",
         "Gross margin for the quarter were 57% up from both 55% in the third quarter in 2019 as well from 47.5 in the second quarter of 2020. We indicated that the drop on last quarter's margins was going to be a temporary as a result of product mix, an increase in warranty costs, and higher labor expense as we staffed up ahead of future product, production demands. As anticipated, margins bounced back and we are in line with margins achieved the past few quarters.",
         "Total operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were $2.2 million flat with the second quarter and up incrementally from the third quarter a year ago. I would like to once again mention that all the revenues have been increasing this year, most recently growing 30% in the third quarter, operating expenses have not increased. Research and development expense was up approximately 150,000 from a year ago, reflecting an increase in amount of Internally funded R&D primarily related to obtaining FAA Certification for the King Air Autothrottle systems. Despite our 30% growth this quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses were down from a year ago, mainly due to lower travel expense, professional fees and trade show expenses. Most of these reductions are result of restrictions arising from Corona virus. For the quarter, we generated operating income of 1.2 million or slightly over 20% of revenue. Due to the continued availability of lost carry backs, we recognized minimal tax expense in the quarter.",
         "We reported quarter net income of 1.3 million or $0.07 per share. This with the most profitable quarter in 13 quarters. With the first five months of the year, both net income and earnings per share increased 137% and 140% respectively as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The company remains in a strong financial position and generated positive operating cash flow of 340,000 in the quarter and 567 year to date, such as the news recently to fund accounts receivable, which are correspondingly higher due to the significant growth in revenues.",
         "On June 30, 2020, we had $23 million of cash on hand and no debt. We believe that the company has sufficient cash to fund operations for the foreseeable future. I'd like to turn the call over to Shahram."
      ],
      "Shahram Askarpour": [
         "Thank you, Rell. Good morning everyone. Reported of Q3, the revenues are up profitability [indiscernible] general aviation industry's most prestigious manufactures astronauts contracted with us to install our proprietary ThrustSense autothrottle as standard equipment on the production of King Air aircraft. We have achieved this progress in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing new safety policies and procedures that have kept all of our employees safe and productive as well as protect our partners and customers.",
         "During the month of April, in order to safeguard the health of our employees, we provided our production workers with two paid time off and [indiscernible] to minimize congestion in our plant. We have installed automated personnel temperature monitoring at our main facility entrance with facial recognition software in conjunction with daily and in-between break sanitization and weekly antiviral fogging of the entire facility to minimize risk of an outbreak. The organization has digested these changes and in the third quarter, as Rell reviewed, margins were up significantly from the second quarter as As our operating conditions have normalized from these actions. In fact, we are continuing with hiring to meet the growing demand in areas of production, sales, product support and engineering.",
         "The contract for the Beechcraft King Air to an engine aircraft represents our third OEM production contract joining the Boeing KC-46A and the Pilatus PC-24. These contracts provide an underlying ongoing stream of revenue consistent with their respective delivery schedules.",
         "The aggregate that represent the potential for future revenues are multiple of our stated backlog, so we consider them fundamental to our business.",
         "Textron clearly recognizes the important risk mitigation nature of our autothrottle virtually on twin-engine aircraft and for that reason, they are making it standard equipment on their King Air.",
         "They believed the extra safety offered by ThurstSense provides Beechcraft with an advantage in the highly competitive general aviation market. Annual King Air production rates are higher than those of the PC-24, but in the case of King Air, also there are already over 5,000 airplanes in service. Textron is also beginning to actively market our autothrottle at the service centers so it can be offered to owners as a retrofit option.",
         "Parallel, we are also aggressively marketing our retrofit package autothrottle to government entities and our portfolio of FBOs. We have already delivered production oil, it's all for Textron which are included in the third quarter revenues.",
         "Simulators for the production of King Air aircraft are currently being upgraded, they are autothrottle and they will be training King Air pilots within a couple of months.",
         "First, we continue to market our autothrottle to Textron and other OEMs beyond twin turboprop aircraft as we see applicability of some of its safety enhancements to twin jets.",
         "We are in discussion with OEMs to include our ThurstSense autothrottle in several other production aircrafts. We believe Textron's recent public announcement will attractive attention of other generalization aircraft manufacturers and as Geoff mentioned, transform Pilatus from [indiscernible] Potentially lifesaving standard equipment on their fleet. Now quickly reviewing our ongoing program, the PC -24 program, remains on track to deliver approximately 50 Pilatus aircrafts this year. As with all, our long-term production contracts, we are specified for installation of on all of the PC-24s Pilatus manufacturers, which is already over 100. These are generally only a quarter or two of deliveries carried in our backlog and therefore only a fraction of OEM delivery potentials is visible through that channel. We believe the PC-24 program represents a long-term opportunity, and now the similar contract with Textron was significantly after that potential.",
         "In the commercial transport market, air cargo delivery services keep buying 0.757 and 767 planes and converting them. As part of their conversion, we are seeing steady demand for Flat Panel Displays. As noted, we finished up development work for the F5 air data computer this past quarter, and we will start production deliveries for the US Navy Fleet retrofit this quarter. With this contract successfully completed, we are now turning our attention to foreign military, which also fly the F5 and could be a large new market for this versatile drama.",
         "Our KC-46 program is also production contract, it continues to make a steady contribution to our top and bottom lines. New orders in the third quarter were 2.7 million and backlog was 6.5 million at quarter end.",
         "Rell mentioned that our travel and trade show expense was down this year, so we have had fewer opportunities to personally meet with our new prospects. The FAA is on the work from home orders, which is added complexity we are managing. By these conditions, the FAA personnel have been very supporting of our efforts by diligently reviewing our submittals and timely issuance of certifications, such as the most recent certification for production in King Air. The aggregate, we don't believe the pandemic will have a material impact on our business and are excited about the prospects of our portfolio of products. Let me turn the call back to Geoff for some closing remarks."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hey guys, congratulations on a good quarter. You actually got to my forecast revenues and your profits were, were better than my forecast. Thanks to G&A being less than expected. Over the long-term, it seems to me that the biggest contribution will come from aircraft production that compete with the King Air. I mean the King Air has been around for about 30 years I think, I don't know how much--how many new King Airs will be You will be producing, so it seems like the biggest protection will be for competing aircraft that don't have that capability. And for retrofit of existing gears, can you give us any thoughts about how the company views the marketplace?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "David Campbell"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, a couple of things. First of all, there's not a hell lot of twin-engine airplanes coming out, there are no, the King Air is a proven standard and as we said, the large--the large market is not so much ongoing production, more or less excellent business is 5,000 units out there and we can offer, and these are valuable aircrafts. ",
            "These are single engine piper cubs. So, they are well maintained and by the way, people fly them around with their families on and people who are interested in protecting their families and protecting the airplane are interested in our autothrottle and that's in part why Textron is promoting it through their retrofit centers. I think the King Air is still a strong airplane and the [indiscernible] is a fast airplane, people are taking them. Many of the airplane, the King Air has important bigger and faster arrangements on them as well. So the market opportunity in our opinion is very large and King Air is an ideal aircraft because it's a high value airplane that we provide real performance advantages and safety to the airplane itself and the flight crew as well. But there is another airplane, single engine airplanes, we do that. We're finding that, we are looking at not just GA, but military aircraft, air transports. ",
            "I don't like twin-engine but multi-engine airplanes. We can do exactly the same thing in a multi-engine airplane and that traditional approach to autothrottles is prohibitively expensive and basically makes it impossible to retrofit. Our system is capable of doing both of those. So, we think we have a very strong advantage and I'll remind you, our market direction was always a very strong retrofit company because we believe that when business was bad, they stopped buying new airplanes and they fixed the old ones and when business was good, they They couldn't get the new airplanes fast enough, so they had to fix the old ones. ",
            "That formula worked out extremely well for us in the past, I believe that that formula will continue to work for us. So I'm optimistic and very pleased and honestly, I see a relationship with Textron and their--their enthusiastic support and by the way, very active support by--by Textron and oh, by the way the FAA who acknowledged that, as they said to me, we lose almost 100 people, 100 lives a year and save lives, but that's a good endorsement."

Well, we didn't have an STC until three weeks ago, so we're doing it now, but we are, we see it as a, as a strong, but this is a strong market opportunity and in our existing PC-12, we're announcing the new generation autothrottle for the PC-12 that--that offers everything that new airplane does and many more with a whole bunch of patented features that provides the--the operators real safety and system awareness."

First of all, they wanted to make sure that they announced their new airplane, which just came out two days ago with the autothrottle and they didn't want to undermine that announcement. Secondly, we haven't finished certification of the units to deliver the production units yet, so they were, they were preparing. This is a big deal, preparing, they have these these service centers, which are huge; each one is huge. ",
            "I think the one in Tampa has about 8 hangers, enormous operation. They have to get that stamped up and trained and start getting the approval Equipment available before they do an announcement. They will make their announcement next day, oh well, we don't have any units to give you. So, it's [indiscernible] and remember the other thing that's compounded it, it's the COVID-19. They were shut down in the plant and at the service center. Nobody was bringing their airplanes in because of the epidemic, the pandemic. So, all of that had a negative effect, but we're seeing that bit clearing out and we're frankly very optimistic."

Textron has done a hell of a good job and in implementing and putting it on their airplane. They did it with a remarkable speed and support.

So, they're going to bring up to 360, that was the important one, that's the latest and greatest airplane and by the way if you look at the announcement, the first announcement is IS&S autothrottle for the 360 and then they're turning over another instant because it's a significant improvement. It's worthwhile looking at that youtube as well from the chief test file.

We did, we did $150 million on the KC-135 program. We did, we did RVSM for over 60% of the world market. Those are all retrofit. What is the wonderful thing about retrofit, it's the volume terms and--and you don't have the slow staging. So anyway, we looked at it now and as a joint effort with Textron and Textron is aggressively marketing it as a, as an install in their existing fleets."

We don't ever predict the next quarter, other than I can tell you that internal estimates, we don't, we don't want it to go down as we get it all. So we try to keep going up and then you can only, that's the only way we keep our shareholders happy.",

The fact is that, we think we have a unique product that does not exist as there is no competitor around Out there now, and we're very pleased with it and we want to exploit opportunities in other areas. As it has gotten acceptance by one of the largest OEMs in the world from general aviation, we expect that retrofit market is going to be achievable.

I have a couple of, I guess accounting questions that relates to the fact that I think last quarter new orders were listed as I forget, what $7 or $8 million and they are pretty high. This, the third quarter, they were listed as $2.7 million which was quite a drop, but I know you'd say and this is a standard language and I think all your releases that backlog excludes potential future sole-source production orders, and then you name some of them and you've added Textron King Air to that. So, does that mean that some of the new orders in your second fiscal quarter, the March quarter included orders for the King Air 360, and now, and the $2.7 million therefore does no longer be counted in new orders or in backlog, is that correct?"

I think, just going back the last quarter's notes, I think, Geoff, you had mentioned you thought that that as early of next year that the the OEM revenue may be as much as I think it was the prior year, prior year sale. So with just like ball parking and that's somewhere in the 15 million to 18 million range. When you were saying that, Geoff, I just want to make sure I understand what you were saying, you were only talking about the existing three OEM deals, not any additional OEM business you might be getting from Textron once the other King Air productions are approved.

I think we have, if we look into 2, it could be, be it could be double-digits. It could be 10, 12 kind of million next year for sure. We think this should be the larger business, this is going to be in the retrofit. We look at the production aircraft as good steady business, we would expect it. We do the entire tenure production line and the pandemic sort of light was up and we get people back moving our aircraft, although I among other things, I think I'm optimistic that people will be flying their airplanes more often because it's a lot more comfortable being in your own airplane and not worrying about who's sitting next to you.",

We've been there obviously a number of times and it's--it's a brand new high-volume facility. So their, but they are cautious. The company is sensibly cautious and moving smoothly and slowly, they don't want Hiccups, they don't want to jump too quickly and they are, they are doing it deliberately and doing a whole good job.

Our retrofit system besides having an incredible record of reliability and performance also can be installed in a matter of less than a week, four or five days. The competitor takes a month. It costs somewhere between $50,000 and $75,000 a day to put a transport aircraft on the ground.

So we know how to do a turboprop, a turbofan engine and we have had people that have contacted us and expressed an interest in putting them both in their production and potentially retrofit, but primarily Primarily production. So, we see a market in that area. ",

There are, there are tens of thousands of them in operation right now that would--would benefit enormously from our autothrottle. As an example, we were able to do something and have patents pending on it now for our longer mode where we actually measure the efficiency of the airplanes in real-time and adjust the speed of the airplane to maximize its endurance.

So Amazon is operating it themselves. Where they go with that and there is a lot of rumors on what's going on. But we would expect it to be around for the operation because as I said, the downtime is fractional, is a small downtime. We actually were able to modify an airplane in 24 hours once, that's never been done, ever in the history of the industry.",

But that would be a strong opportunity just to give you a little background I can remember when I delivered equipment to FedEx when they had seven airplanes. They have 700 now.

So, yeah, that was wonderful, but also is vulnerable if you can't keep supported behind it. So I'm a bit more conservative in my estimates. When I've got a well established retrofit business, then I'll be [indiscernible] street again.",

What are the odds that the, that you could get the FAA to mandate this safety feature on all charter aircrafts, similar to what they did in the '70s with terrain awareness on planes and did not do with helicopters and we have recently seen what can happen there. So what are the odds of that?"

It was a difficult, it was a difficult implementation. They were very, it was a unique situation where we had developed a product and they're not used to that. They are used to having people develop a product for them. ",
            "We developed it for ourselves. They were extremely supportive and I'm, that gives me confidence that there is a strong safety market and I think the FAA knows it for sure and if the NTSB warrants to have acknowledge it, I think it could be. Look, it's very straightforward. I assume Textron's guy, if you get an airplane, if you have a pilot, I'll have the airplane take very slow with an engine out, it's catastrophic and sadly it's a terrible situation and I guess that's true with any airplane, but especially this, we mitigate that, we do it with, there is something that's never been done before. And I assume that people [indiscernible] is a whole bunch of other things it does just besides VMCa protection, all kinds of things.",

I've [indiscernible] reluctance to implement this, I can tell you that the FAA has been as supportive in the certification of this equipment, has taken I think almost six years. As I've never heard or seen in my career, I mean, they've done extremely thorough, but did not drag their feet, they did, they did an admirable job and so I think it's a possibility. I think there's a good possibility if that can happen, but we end up, we've got to pay our dues and get it in their plans to show that that it's a good reliable and all you have to save is one person's life and that will make all the difference."
