         "Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll cover the highlights of the second quarter, which were of course, significantly impacted by COVID-19. I\u2019ll also share an update to our debt structure and finish with some comments on our 2020 guidance, before we move to Q&A, and there\u2019s a lot to cover. So let\u2019s jump in.",
         "Rental revenue for the second quarter was $1.64 billion, which is down $318 million or 16.2% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER decreased $264 million or 15.8%. In that fleet productivity was down 13.6% or $226 million, as primarily reflecting the decline in volume we experienced during the quarter, due to the pandemic. Inflation of about 1.5%, cost us another $26 million and a 0.7% drop in the average size of the fleet was a $12 million headwind to revenue. Rounding out the decline in rental revenue for the quarter was $46 million in lower ancillary revenues and $8 million in lower re-rent, which together were 40 basis point headwind to revenue.",
         "Let\u2019s move to used sales. Used sales revenue was down 10.7% or $21 million year-over-year, which is almost entirely due to less used fleet sold to OEMs in trade packages. The retail used market remains quite strong. OEC sold at retail was up 17% year-over-year, despite a slow start at the beginning of the quarter. Used margins in the quarter were healthy as well. Adjusted gross margin on used sales was 46%. Now, while that\u2019s down from 49.2% in Q2 last year. It\u2019s up 30 basis points sequentially from Q1. Retail pricing was down about 6% of last year\u2019s peak, but consistent with what we saw in the first quarter of this year. Finally, proceeds as a percentage of OEC were a robust 54%, and that sounds fleet sold, that was on average over seven years old.",
         "Taking a look at EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $899 million, down $174 million for 16.2% year-over-year. And here\u2019s a bridge on the dollar change. The impact on rental was a drag of $197 million. OER was a headwind of $179 million with ancillary and re-rent down the combined $18 million. The used sales impact on EBITDA was a headwind of $16 million. Year-over-year, SG&A was better by $48 million with the majority of that benefit coming from lower discretionary costs, including G&A. To a lesser extent, we also had lower commissions and bonus accruals versus Q2 last year.",
         "Our adjusted EBITDA margin was a highlight in the quarter coming in at 46.4%. Now while that\u2019s down 50 basis points year-over-year, our margin clearly reflected our commitment to aggressively managed costs, particularly in the early part of the second quarter, when volumes were most depressed and restrictions were still in effect. Our focus on costs is also evidenced in adjusted EBITDA flow through of 50%. Through the second quarter, we continue to action reduced overtime [Audio Dip] in-house to reduce the use of third parties and canceled or delayed discretionary spend mostly in G&A.",
         "The second quarter flow through benefited from the flexibility we have in our business model to respond quickly on cost. Cost control remains a major focus for us, especially for discretionary spending. But a good portion of our costs will continue to flex with volume. For example, spend on delivery is necessary as volume increases through the season, and we need to reposition fleet to service our customers. And those expectations are included in our guidance.",
         "Back to second quarter results and adjusted EPS, which was $3.68, and includes $0.30 of benefit from discrete tax items, that compares with $4.74 in Q2 last year and the year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower net income from lower revenue in Q2 this year.",
         "Let\u2019s move to CapEx. Year-to-date through the end of Q2, we brought in $353 million in gross rental CapEx, while proceeds from sales of used equipment have been $384 million resulting in negative net CapEx of $31 million. Together, these results reflect our continuing focus on capital discipline.",
         "Turning to free cash flow, another highlight through the end of the quarter. We generated over $1.4 billion in the first half of the year, an increase of $643 million. Our rates remained strong coming in at 9.6% for the second quarter. That continues to meaningfully exceed our weighted average cost of capital, which continues to run south of 8%. Year-over-year, ROIC was down 120 basis points due in large part to the decline in revenue this year.",
         "Looking at the balance sheet and our capital structure. Our balance sheet continues to be the strongest it\u2019s ever been. Net debt at June 30 was $10.3 billion, which is down $1.3 billion year-over-year and down $800 million quarter-over-quarter. Leverage at June 30 was just under 2.5 times, which is flat sequentially and down $0.03 of a churn versus the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Our current $500 million share repurchase program is still on pause. As a reminder, we had purchased $257 million of stock on that program, before we paused in March. Liquidity remains extremely strong. We finished the second quarter with over $3.8 billion in total liquidity. That\u2019s made up of ABL capacity of just over $3.6 billion and availability on our AR facility of $56 million. We also had $127 million in cash.",
         "Yesterday, we announced we will redeem our $800 million, 5.5% senior notes due 2025. Our decision to do so includes our views of continuing strength in liquidity, given our expectations of free cash flow for the year, which is reflected in our guidance. And speaking of our guidance, I\u2019ll close with a few comments. Of course, no one knows the ultimate impact from the pandemic on 2020 or behind. We continued to run numerous scenarios each with varying levels of revenue expectations and related actions to arrive at adjusted EBITDA. Taking into consideration the six months behind us and the visibility we have to the rest of the year.",
         "Our guidance represents what we think of as our most likely range of possibilities. And to be clear, this guidance does not contemplate a shutdown of the economy like we experienced earlier in the year. Our CapEx guidance has been refined as we balance our fleet mix in response to customer demand and continue to focus on fleet productivity and better fleet absorption.",
         "Finally, and notably, our free cash flow update is a clear indicator of the strength and resiliency of our business model. As we plan to generate over $2 billion in free cash flow this year, paying down debt with the vast majority of it.",
         "And with that, let\u2019s move on to your questions. Jonathan, would you please open the line?"
      ],
      "Matt Flannery": [
         "Thanks, Jonathan and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I\u2019ll begin with a statement that sums up our position on 2020. We believe we\u2019ve weathered the worst of the economic impact from the pandemic. And while the shape of the recovery remains unclear, the wholesale shutdown of the macro has started to lift. The visibility is still somewhat limited, but near-term indicator suggest that activity in the second half of 2020 may continue to track with seasonal patterns, which is something that we saw in June and July. The COVID response plan we shared with you in April is working. We can point to tangible gains from executing that plan, most notably, a strong second quarter performance. More than anything, our results confirmed the flexibility and resiliency of our operating model. It\u2019s one of the reasons we felt comfortable reintroducing full year guidance.",
         "I want to start with a few metrics from the second quarter and after that, Jess will take you through the results and the guidance in detail, and then we\u2019ll go to Q&A. One highlight of the quarter is OEC on rent. I\u2019m happy to report that rental volumes in all of our geographic regions finished the quarter above the trough they had in April. And for the company as a whole, that low point came on April 9. From that date through June 30, fleet on rent showed fairly steady improvement rebounding by almost 14%. This translates to over $1 billion of incremental fleet on rent. The biggest takeaways from the quarter have to do with the five work streams we introduced in April. And to remind you, they are ensuring employee safety, supporting the needs of our customers, showing discipline with both our CapEx and our operating expenditures and proactively managing our balance sheet.",
         "I\u2019ll first speak to the cost management. This was very evident in our results. We aggressively flexed our operating expenses to mitigate the revenue loss, resulting in a decline of just 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin. Our margin in the quarter was 46.4%, implying a strong flow through of about 50%. I see proof of our cost vigilance every day in our spent on things like third-party services and overtime. And while certain costs will return with volume, the team has gone above and beyond to run a lean shift.",
         "Turning to CapEx. We\u2019re now guiding to a range of $800 million to $900 million for 2020. This is significantly lower than the $2.1 billion gross CapEx we spent last year. Our primary focus this year is to serve customers with the fleet that we already own. And when we do make selective investments, they\u2019re targeted to specific opportunities. And as a result of this cost and capital discipline, our free cash flow generation in the quarter was a very strong $817 million. This is a year-over-year increase of almost 300%. I\u2019m particularly pleased, we achieve these numbers without compromising our capacity for the future. This means, no branch closures, no COVID-related layoff.",
         "We thought long and hard about this playbook for years and it came together quickly in March. We\u2019re taking a measured response that serves the near and long-term interest of the company. Just a lot more to say about the financial impacts of the work streams, but I wanted you to understand just how well our field organization is rising to the challenge. And it was a huge ask of them to provide essential services during such a difficult time. And they\u2019re doing a great job. Not only did the team embrace the health and safety protocols in our COVID plan, but they did it safely with another recordable rate below 1.",
         "The work stream also gives you a bird\u2019s eye view of how we\u2019re maintaining our competitive advantages. In short, we\u2019re managing the business in a way that leverages our value proposition. Customers see us as a business partner, capable of delivering value across all of their needs and under all conditions. And throughout this pandemic, we\u2019ve been determined to meet this expectation. And I\u2019m happy to say, we\u2019re succeeding.",
         "Now a few comments on the operating environment. It\u2019s certainly been a turbulent few months. Industrial activity has deteriorated more than construction, and that\u2019s not surprising given the domino effect of COVID on different parts of the industrial economy. For example, as people stayed at home, the decline in demand for gasoline and jet fuel significantly impacted our petrochem customers. And on the construction side, non-res is a very broad category that covers a lot of different market dynamics and some of the verticals have stayed busy throughout the pandemic like power and data center builds, and others are obviously more challenged like retail, hospitality. And now with states reopening, we see the same COVID news, you do about areas that are struggling to avoid spikes in the infection rates. And so far, it hasn\u2019t had any additional impact on our business. Our focus is on monitoring market conditions that could be triggered by infection rates like state and provincial construction restrictions. So we\u2019ll continue to keep a close eye on that.",
         "We\u2019re also seeing demand continue for our Specialty segment, which is holding up very well. Our strategic investments in specialty are making helpful contributions to the segment revenue this year. Another positive has been the strength of the used-equipment market. So far retail demand has remained solid. We view this as a leading indicator, meaning contractors expect to need equipment for their upcoming projects. And we\u2019ve been able to leverage that demand to recover more than half of our original investment on equipment that\u2019s over seven years old. Big picture, we know that our end markets will recover at different speeds in different areas, fluctuations like this allow us to leverage our strengths of flexibility, diversification and scale. We have a deep fleet of fungible assets that we can shift between construction and industrial sectors and across geographies and verticals. Even in this environment, our flexibility helps to mitigate the pressure on revenue.",
         "We could also pivot to new opportunities that may arise from COVID. For example, the idea of repurposing large commercial properties has been floated by some construction analysts. This could create some incremental demands in the construction space. So that gives you some color. Our customers are still working their way out of the tunnel and it\u2019s our job to be the partner that helps them get there. And what we\u2019re hearing from our customers is that they have the same feeling we do about 2020, reasonable near-term visibility with current work and backlogs and less visibility in late 2020 and 2021. In the meantime, we\u2019re on course with our plan and making good progress.",
         "All things considered, we delivered a strong second quarter with solid fundamentals for profitability. The things that we told you we could control, we did control, and we move fast in a very volatile environment. The guidance, we provided reflects our best estimates on what we can achieve, barring some significant change to the operating environment. And the ranges are a bit broader than we typically provided midyear, but that\u2019s the reality of the times we\u2019re operating in. And under any scenario, we expect to generate significant free cash flow this year. And if the economic impacts, COVID linger on, we have additional flexibility and we can leverage in our business model to remain resilient.",
         "I\u2019ll wrap up with something I talked about last quarter. When I stated that the value we preserve now will be the foundation for the value we create in the future. A big part of that value is our commitment to being first call for customers under all market conditions. We\u2019ve been putting our best efforts in delivering on that commitment. And our Q2 results show that our best efforts and our business model are more than up to the task. Not only are we preserving value, we\u2019re doing it strategically, in ways that\u2019ll drive returns today and in the future.",
         "Now with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Jess to cover the numbers. Jess?"

But can you help us at least on the lower end, kind of how you\u2019re thinking about some of the key states, the Florida, the Texas, even parts of Southern California? A, are you seeing any reaction negatively by customers for projects, equipment demand related to the uptick in the virus? And again, sort of what\u2019s baked into the low end of the range? Just so we have a sense of \u2013 if there\u2019s any cushion at all from the virus? Or is it just pure assuming no virus impact the rest of the year?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, David. This is Matt. So first to answer your question about the states kind of tried to cover that in the script. We\u2019re seeing all the spikes ups specifically in four or five pretty large states and large for us as well. When we went back to look at the data it\u2019s not impacting our business at this point. So what would, would be closures, construction restrictions that haven\u2019t manifested, similar to what happened early on in Boston area, the New York area and the Bay area were the most specific ones back in the beginning. So we\u2019re not seeing that. What\u2019s embedded in our guidance is more of a normal seasonal build that we would expect. Although we\u2019re not going to \u2013 we don\u2019t plan on backfilling the gap that was created from COVID in the beginning of the \u2013 end of first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter.",
            "We do expect to see normal seasonal builds. As far as cushion, the fourth quarter is a little bit less clear today than what we see in Q3. We think the backlogs and the work that\u2019s ongoing in Q3 is much more predictable from our perspective. And then where we fall within that range that we gave really depends on, do we get any acceleration or deceleration of the demand in Q4? And that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. None of it comprehends all five of those states doing a major shutdown, right? I don\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s not really the way we ran about it, nor do we think that\u2019s going to happen. I think that people have been pretty obvious to their intent to continue to make sure they drive the economy, and that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re planning and how we guided."

If you want to think about that as a positive momentum, whether it\u2019s backlogs of ABC \u2013 contractor backlog is down about \u2013 it\u2019s out to about eight months now, right? ABL \u2013 ABI rather is not quite as bad as it was, but still doesn\u2019t denote growth. So I\u2019d call those indicators bouncing off the bottom, but I wouldn\u2019t call them positive yet. And I think even our own customer confidence index improved sequentially, but still not to the levels of what we\u2019d expect. And I think it\u2019s because the lack of visibility that we talked about. Just \u2013 it\u2019s just not there right now for people to get comfort. The experience of being better today than we were in April has given everybody some more confidence, but just is not enough to predict 2021 yet."

How should we just \u2013 I know Jess isn\u2019t going to want to give a CapEx number for next year yet? But just so we give some sense of the spending below replacement this year, but if you\u2019re back on a seasonal pattern, just to gauge a bit, the cash flow impact from CapEx changes? Can you just give us at least a framework to think about if we\u2019re back on seasonal pattern?"

If you thought that demand would return to 2019-like levels, that\u2019s what you mean by normal seasonality, then you could think about 2019 CapEx. I\u2019m not sure that, that\u2019s visibility that anybody or in anybody\u2019s calculus quite yet. But if we get a vaccine, if the world starts opening up, people start traveling again, certainly, that would be a thought that we\u2019d be looking towards, but it\u2019s way early for us to even get close to thinking definitively. And by the end of the year, we\u2019ll try to get there to what our guide would be. But the reality is we won\u2019t really have to make those CapEx decisions until we start building in the spring of 2021, is when we really have to start spending money."

First, on the implied kind of back half of the year guide, when we look at equipment rental revenue that was down 16% in the second quarter, and the guide implies something similar in the back half of the year. So even as you go through the second quarter, and you see parts of the country that were shut down and coming back online, but we don\u2019t see kind of sequential improvement into the back half of the year on the decline rate. Can you talk about what\u2019s gotten better? And maybe what softened a little bit? And then the degree to which it\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s low visibility in Q4?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I think your last comment hit out the most, Joe, is that lack of visibility in Q4. So when we think about our GAAP on a year-over-year perspective, we think it\u2019s going to improve slightly, and that 15% versus 16% rent revenue decline in Q2, but we don\u2019t think that, that\u2019s going to compress. Right now, it\u2019s that pipeline of demand starts to increase. If pent-up demand for some work to get done or people get through better through Q3 than we expected, then we\u2019ll accelerate that. But when we think about the places that we just really don\u2019t see changing for the better in the back half, it would be, first and foremost, upstream. We\u2019re not counting on upstream.",
            "And I don\u2019t even think the folks in that space are counting on improvement there. When we think about the one big variable that we didn\u2019t expect, in a normal recession that we are seeing in this pandemic, is the petrochem, right. Specifically downstream business that just nobody needs their products. So if people start traveling again, that would be a pick up. That\u2019s probably more of a 2021event than a Q4 event. So these are the reasons why we think \u2013 and then non-res will be choppy. So we think that this steady \u2013 I don\u2019t want to anchor too much on the midpoint, but this steady, about 15% down year-over-year would imply a standard seasonal build off the hole that was already created. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it."

But the question is, the cushion to continue aging the fleet, if you find yourself in sort of a protracted slow demand kind of environment. So can you talk about where you are on fleet age? Where you\u2019re comfortable going? How much cushion that gives you to continue buying at this kind of pace versus navigating back to replacement?"

So based on what we\u2019re seeing kind of going out to the end of the year, we\u2019ll likely age the fleet somewhere between five and six months, right? And so we\u2019ve talked a lot with you guys and with investors about having at least a year of headroom in our cat classes to be able to age out the fleet in down cycles like this one, and not have any real discernible impact on increased R&M or have any urgent need to replace. So as we even think forward into 2021, there still is some opportunity and some headwinds. If we needed to age the fleet out a little bit more, we could without any real impact."

My recollection is that you called out fleet on rent being down 15%. And actually, you told us that the improvement here was pretty significant, you\u2019re up 14% from that level. I\u2019m trying to juxtapose that against the 4% decline in the fleet in the quarter. What I\u2019m getting at here, I\u2019m trying to understand is, is you\u2019re getting to the third quarter here. Where are you on a year-over-year basis in terms of fleet on rent? And what is the implication here for the fleet productivity metric?"

Now what you\u2019re seeing is just a normal seasonal build off of that. So even though we\u2019re sequentially and did through Q1 sequentially saw improvement, you have to think about the fleet productivity is measured in that year-over-year gap. And we don\u2019t talk about the individual components, but we certainly shared color that coming into the year, we thought our biggest opportunity was absorption. You can imagine that was exacerbated by COVID. So as we continue to manage the denominator of that calculation, we are expecting to see sequential improvement. But we\u2019re not expecting to see positive fleet productivity, unfortunately, until we get past these comps probably in the Q2 to second half of 2021. And we\u2019ll continue to depend on what kind of demand environment we\u2019re in, manage that inflow, right? We\u2019ll manage the denominator as well as the numerator, depending on what demand says. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at it, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to focus on driving higher productivity."

Obviously, your cost flexibility has been evident.

I think anybody that didn\u2019t list to the Spanish flu, right? So this is a very, very unique creation of this location. And it made us move really fast. It made our customers move really fast. So it went from almost panic when you really think about it out there to now people starting to feel a little better, but still very cautious so that\u2019s how people are managing their business as well. I mean, when you see that flow through that we had in Q2, it was part of that thing\u2019s immediately shut down. So that gave us a bit of a cost advantage. And it was \u2013 I think you saw that in a lot of businesses. Now people are starting to think about what the future brings. Some of the things that we\u2019re learning in a post-COVID environment or what end markets are going to do better.",

That flexibility and fungibility of our assets so that we can move them to where we need to move them to. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re moving. I\u2019m sure many customers are doing the same. Customers are going to need to find different ways to drive revenue, different ways to create value for their clients, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. We also think technology and safety are both going to \u2013 they were important already. I think they\u2019re going to be more top of mind in our space and for our customers. And we think that\u2019s inherent to the large players that have the scale to invest in some of these. And we\u2019ll continue to use that as a future post-COVID opportunity as well."

So could you just kind of outline whether it\u2019s re-rent or outside hall? Or what are the kind of the improvements that allowed cost to flex down so abruptly? I don\u2019t think you did a bunch of big salary cuts or layoffs or closures. And then I suppose some of those things are still in reserve if the economy doesn\u2019t get a whole lot worse.

We\u2019ve also, as Matt mentioned, the beginning of the second quarter, especially as we were all adjusting to restrictions in place, we very quickly shut down our discretionary costs, right? You saw that in the SG&A year-over-year benefit that we called out this quarter, where P&E, of course, right? That\u2019s an easy one to kind of think through as folks stop traveling immediately.

Can you just give us the guide points on when you might \u2013 what you intend to do with that as the year progresses?

I know it\u2019s \u2013 you guys always discourage kind of using the midpoint anchors for the guidance for the decrementals, but just kind of going back to the cost discussion. I mean, your second half decremental guidance does suggest the decrementals are worse than \u2013 or higher than what they were in the second quarter. So can we just kind of walk through a little bit more detail? Like what\u2019s coming back on? I know there\u2019s variable commissions and things like that.

I mean, we\u2019re really thinking about this guidance as a range of possibilities and so probably easiest for me to frame that in terms of flow through for the back half, right, where it\u2019s \u2013 where we land is really going to depend on how the revenue sets up first and foremost, right? And then if you think about it from a cost perspective, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there may be some variable costs that come back into business as we \u2013 they\u2019ll flex with the volume, right? So if you even just think of the seasonal trend as we work out to the October peak, you may have some \u2013 we may see some additional delivery costs, right, and repositioning, even over time, right, where we normally will use over time to flex for labor needs instead of bringing in full-time heads. So we could see some of that come back in, depending on how the volume trends. Discretionary costs, we\u2019re going to continue to keep a tight handle on, but we could see a situation where if things do start to open up, we do start to have folks spending some T&E, meeting with customers, right? Some of those costs could come back into the business as well, at a rate a little higher than the way we were able to pull back on them in the second quarter."

So we\u2019ll continue to invest in those. We\u2019ve done about 10 cold starts year-to-date and we\u2019re planning on doing another five in the back half of the year.

But let\u2019s say, you wanted to look for the next area of costs to actually take out, if things were to be a little bit softer in the demand side? What are those next areas of costs that you would look to tackle? I think, Matt, you said in your prepared remarks that there haven\u2019t been any COVID layoffs yet. Is that where we would go?

So let me just talk about \u2013 forget about the numerical values, I think we\u2019ve covered that strategically. Coming out of 2009, and having experienced that downturn, and what we did and had to do and what I would want to do differently and what we want to do differently, we\u2019ve built a strategy to make sure we didn\u2019t have to do a couple of things. Number one, we didn\u2019t want to unnecessarily take out or damage our capacity to get ready when we got through the other side.",

And that was very intentional in it. And you can see from the flow-through that worked. When we think about store closures, we intentionally did not want to go there. Now if we went this into a full recession, 2009 type recession, which I don\u2019t think anybody is predicting right now. But if it happens, we have that playbook. We know what to do. But there\u2019s a couple of things that we are going to limit. We\u2019re not going to fire sale equipment, we don\u2019t need to.",

This balance sheet allows us to react a little bit differently. We\u2019ll still protect margins.

Someone could ask, why are you guys spending another \u2013 at the midpoint, about $500 million CapEx, because there\u2019s offensive opportunities. There\u2019s products and end markets and verticals that we\u2019re still going to support, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at it.

I\u2019m wondering, based on your experience going through this environment, is there an opportunity to, on the other side of it, to have higher fleet availability?

So I had a note from a customer early on during COVID, when we created this touchless system that they sent a nice, very nice note thanking us said they have the best rental experience ever. They pulled their truck up, everything was done digitally about ordering the equipment and confirmations. And when they pulled up, we hooked a trailer up, had a skid steer behind it, and he went off this way. He said it was the fastest, most painless transaction he\u2019s ever had in the rental business. So there you go. Necessity is the mother of invention, once again. And we\u2019ll continue to take those learnings.",

But maybe having more heads and eliminating some of the more expensive variable costs we have like over time.

Industrial, overall, if you take that out \u2013 if you take out petrochem, industrial looks a little more like construction overall, right, not really a big deal.",
            "But when you look at data centers, Power as a Segment, infrastructure, there are opportunities that we can lean into. And whether we add additional products to the mix, which we\u2019ve been doing, or whether we just enhance some of the offerings that we already have to make sure we\u2019re being a one-stop shop solution for all these end markets. That\u2019s really how we\u2019re looking going forward. And I think the industrial markets will recover at the same pace, and maybe even a little faster because of the petrochem drop once we get on the other side of COVID."

And we\u2019re not seeing it. So the data is not showing a correlation to our fleet on rent, our revenues, our activity in those states that would match a negative correlation to the infection rates. And that\u2019s really what we meant. We\u2019ll keep an eye on it. If that pivots, as always, we\u2019ll let everybody know, but we actually haven\u2019t seen that.

And always hard to know if this is all apples-to-apples. It just feels like some of your competitors are posting stronger growth in what they label as our specialty rental businesses. I\u2019m just wondering, are you seeing increased competition in any of those specialty markets, particularly in areas like climate control, parts of power gen, which have been very, very hot markets as the core general rental markets are depressed?"

It\u2019s part of an emergency response. When you think about all the temporary, whether it\u2019s shelters, businesses, people putting tents out in their parking lots so that they can feed people outdoors, right? There\u2019s so much opportunity for power to grow. So we\u2019ve been seeing that growth as well. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re losing share there in any way, shape or form. We\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re doing there.",

For us, how we look at our specialty business, it\u2019s products that have more of a unique, fully embedded engineered solutions, so to speak, right? So it\u2019s not just dropping off the generator. It\u2019s cabling, it\u2019s putting step down transformers, it\u2019s making sure we\u2019re creating a solution and that\u2019s how we look at our specialty. And I won\u2019t comment on others. It\u2019s just I understand there are some products that are in other specialties that are not launched. So we\u2019re not seeing any change in the competitive dynamic there."

I\u2019d be curious what kind of growth you\u2019re seeing ex-Fluid Solutions? Was trench up this quarter? Or did it behave more like a gen rent type business, at least in terms of demand trajectory?

Think about pumps and tanks and how much in the petrochem space we\u2019re penetrated with those products and work even with the Baker acquisition, right? So they\u2019re certainly faring worse more in line with how our gen rent areas are faring in those marketplaces. So that would be a drag on the overall specialty growth. Trench is slightly better than the average, but not as a positive, we\u2019re calling out power because power is unique. I don\u2019t think people would think at any business unit would be positive. So power, our reliable on site business, although small, is \u2013 seems positive as well. But I think you go ahead that fluid certainly is having challenges as we\u2019re going through COVID here.

And kind of at what point would you have to start outsourcing again as sales do recover? And then maybe just same quantification on the overtime.

We want to keep our people busy first, and that\u2019s been a big part of our COVID response, and then maybe some logistics and third-party.",

Some of that was for stuff that was really beat up out in the oilfield last year, stuff that needed major repairs, and we were already utilizing our capacity, so we outsourced it. And that is always an opportunity, an area to flex, but I think in this one post-COVID learnings, as I talked about earlier, maybe we will in-source more going forward in a more stable environment. So I don\u2019t have the numbers for you on what that historical trend is, but it\u2019s certainly an opportunity for us going forward."

And then I think last quarter, you had talked about $1.5 billion in OEC on rent that had come off-line, it sounds like there\u2019s been a seasonal build of about $1 billion, so about $500 million that\u2019s still kind of that hole you were talking about? And you\u2019ve also been kind of characterizing it as a very typical seasonal build that\u2019s been happening off of that hole. So can you just help us understand, is that hole all petrochem and the retail and hospitality and special events and those projects just never came back online? Or is it just the seasonal build that you are seeing those projects come back online and it\u2019s typical, but just off a lower base. Just trying to understand what \u2013 if there have been projects that have just kind of been permanently delayed that you just aren\u2019t seeing come back, carrying that with the comments about the seasonal build?"

But unlike what we\u2019ve talked about for the past few years, we are seeing project delays and cancellations but more delays. For us, right now, with the lack of visibility, we\u2019re just counting on the delays as they\u2019re not there until they come back. And it\u2019s very spotty. Just think about the major airports. Last year, we\u2019re traveling around back when we were traveling. You saw work at just about every major airport that you flew into. About half of those are continuing on, and then half are \"paused or delayed.\" And when those and what would create those coming back is something that will be part of the recovery, but we don\u2019t have the visibility to that right now.",

You JFK, that\u2019s slowed down and delayed many phases of that project. So we see this as a future opportunity. But the difference between now and what we\u2019ve talked about for the past 12 quarters is we are seeing project delays, and we do believe we\u2019ll continue to have a seasonal build off this lower base, but those would all have to come back online for us to raise that pace to start to fill that gap."

But in our mind, with the uncertainty going on right now, we\u2019re going to treat them fairly similar because the cancellation could be brought back up as well. So just think about the industry have been most challenged for COVID. Certainly, anything petrochem related has been shelved, delayed, whatever term you want to use, travel, right? It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s two different thoughts. There are some airports are saying, we don\u2019t have a lot of activity right now, let\u2019s lean in. And there are others that are delaying. I would imagine it has to do with their funding and their confidence going forward on how much volume they\u2019ll do in those locations.",

So some of those are being shelved. So \u2013 and then certainly, anything in hospitality, right, travel and hospitality, we\u2019re seeing a lot of it. So just think about the industries that are more uncertain than others. Then you\u2019re seeing other things, even power built, I talked about earlier. Power segment is growing for us, whether it\u2019s standard power or alternative power. When you think about data centers, those are growing. That\u2019s a growing opportunity.",

Once they get to it, they realized they can rely on us, that the product will be there, and they\u2019ll have the right equipment at the right time. So we do expect secular penetration on the other side of this. And I think it will be broader, to your point, because we have a broader offering.
