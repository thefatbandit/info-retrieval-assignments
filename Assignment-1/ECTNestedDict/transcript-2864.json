         "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to International Seaways earnings release conference call for the second quarter of 2020.",
         "Before we begin, I would like to start off by advising everyone on the call with us today of the following. During this call, management may make forward-looking statements regarding International Seaways or the tanker industry, which may address, without limitation, the following topics: outlooks for the crude and product tanker markets; changing oil trading patterns; forecasts of world and regional economic activity and of the demand for and production of oil and other petroleum products; the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\\, the company\u2019s strategy; purchases and sales of vessels and other investments; anticipated financing transactions; expectations regarding revenues and expenses, including vessel charter hire and G&A expenses; estimated bookings and TCE rates for the third quarter of 2020 or other periods; estimated capital expenditures in 2020 or other periods; projected scheduled drydock and offhire days; the company\u2019s consideration of strategic alternatives; the company\u2019s ability to achieve its financing and other objectives; and other economic, political and regulatory developments around the world.",
         "Any such forward-looking statements take into account various assumptions made by management based on a number of factors, including management\u2019s experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected and future developments, and other factors that management believes are appropriate to consider in the circumstances.",
         "Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the company\u2019s control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by those statements. Factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause International Seaways\u2019 actual results to differ from expectations include those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2019; in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarter of 2020; and in other filings that company has made or may make in the future with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",
         "With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Lois Zabrocky. Lois?"
      ],
      "Jeffrey Pribor": [
         "Thanks, Lois, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s move directly to reviewing the second quarter results in more detail. But before turning to the slide deck, let me just summarize the consolidated results.",
         "In the second quarter, we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $96.3 million. And as Lois mentioned, this was our second consecutive record quarter. Net income for the second quarter was $64.4 million, or $2.24 per diluted share, which compares to a net loss of $16.5 million, or $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2019. However, excluding the impact of a $4.1 million charge for impairment and gain on sale of vessels, net income was $68.5 million, or $2.39 per diluted share.",
         "Now let\u2019s go to the deck starting with Slide 9. I\u2019ll first discuss the results of our business segments beginning with the Crude Tankers segment. TCEs for the Crude Tankers segment were $106 million for the quarter, compared to $45 million in the second quarter of last year. This increase primarily resulted from the impact of higher average blended rates in all of the VLCC, Suezmax, Aframax, and Panamax sectors.",
         "Now looking at the Product Carriers segment, TCE revenues were $29 million for the quarter, compared to $17 million in the second quarter of last year. This increase again results from the impact of higher average daily rates earned in all of the LR1, LR2 and MR fleets.",
         "Overall, as reflected in the chart top left, consolidated TCE revenues for the second quarter 2020 were $135 million, compared to $62 million in the second quarter of 2020. The increase was principally driven by substantially higher average daily rates earned across the crude and product carrier fleets this quarter, compared to last year\u2019s second quarter.",
         "Looking at the chart, at the top right of the page, adjusted EBITDA was $96 million for the quarter, compared to $21 million in the same period of 2019, and again, the increase was principally driven by higher daily rates.",
         "On the bottom half of the page, if we look at the results sequentially, i.e., quarter-to-quarter. Consolidated TCE revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter were up from the very high first quarter, but increasing by $15 million and $22 million, respectively.",
         "Now, if we turn to Slide 10, we provide a review of Q2 rates and Q3 to date. Let me discuss our bookings in Q3 thus far, which are very healthy, particularly in the larger vessels.",
         "Looking at the far right column, we\u2019ve booked 67% of our total available VLCC days at $64,500 per day on our modern vessels and $59,200 per day overall. 56% of available Suezmax days at approximately $30,900 per day, 45% of available Aframax LR2 days at an average of approximately $14,200 per day and 43% of available Panamax days at an average of approximately $19,000 per day. On the MR side, we\u2019ve booked 48% of our third quarter days at an average of approximately $13,200 per day.",
         "As Lois mentioned, these rates reflect the fact that we opportunistically locked in four of our VLCCs on time charters at an average of $73,300 per day for the entire quarter. For the balance in the quarter, of course, you should keep in mind that spot rates today are lower than we have booked thus far in the quarter but overall, we\u2019re looking at a healthy quarter.",
         "Now if we could move on to Slide 11. The cash cost TCE break-evens for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020, as well as our estimates for going forward are illustrated on this slide.",
         "International Seaways overall break-even rate was $19,700 a day for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020. These rates are \u2013 the all-in daily rates, our owned vessels must earn to cover vessel operating costs, drydocking costs, cash G&A expense and debt service costs, which includes scheduled principal amortization as well as interest.",
         "As Lois mentioned earlier on the call, we entered into four highly attractive time charters, specifically we\u2019ve executed three VLCC time charters \u2013 three-year VLCC time charter for $45,000 per day and an another time charter for 18-year-old VLCC for one year for $53,000 per day. We also executed, two seven month VLCC time charters, at an average rate of $100,000 per day with the vessels delivered in May. The combined rate of those four time charters has taken together, as I just mentioned, is $73,300 a day on average.",
         "And so, taking into consideration distributions from our FSO and the fixed time charter revenue, the overall break-even rate for the last 12 months drops to $17,400. But then, if you go all the way to the far right of the page, we\u2019ve included all-in daily break-even rates for the forward 12 months ended June 30, 2021.",
         "Taking into consideration the contributions from our FSO JV, the four time charters I just mentioned, and also the full prepayment of the $40 million outstanding on the transition term loan facility that Lois mentioned earlier, which lowers our interest expense by $1.2 million. The overall break-even rate drops further to $14,600 per day.",
         "At this time I\u2019ll also take \u2013 like to take the opportunity to reaffirm our cost guidance for the year for modeling purposes. For the remainder of 2020, we expect regular daily OpEx, which includes all running costs, insurance, management fees and other similar and related expenses for our various classes, as always, to be as follows: for VLCC, $8,400 per day; Suezmax, another $1,700; Aframax, $8,100; Panamax, $7,900; and MRs $7,500 per day, excluding any potential impact attributable to COVID-19.",
         "For details on projected drydock CapEx and offhire days by quarter, please turn to Slide 16 \u2013 or you can refer it on Slide 16 in the appendix for an update there. Continuing with cost guidance for your modeling 2020 full-year interest expense is expected to be $37 million after taking into account the payoff of the transition loan in mid-August, which is composed of $33 million of cash interest expense and the balance a non-cash component is $3 million of amortization \u2013 of unamortized discounts and also deferred fees of $1.3 million related to a mark-to-market charge for interest rate color, those are non-cash charges.",
         "So, I would also give you guidance that additionally, after the payoff of the transition loan, our debt will call for a $15 million in scheduled quarterly principal payments beginning in Q3, which is down from $20 million per quarter previously.",
         "For 2020, we expect cash G&A to be in the region of $23 million, of which there has been about $5 million of non-cash items, which is relatively in line with last year. Finally, we expect about $5 million in equity income from our JVs and about $20 million for depreciation and amortization per quarter.",
         "Now if we could go to Slide 12, for our cash bridge. Moving from left to right, we began the second quarter with total cash and liquidity of $150 million. During the quarter, we generated $96 million of adjusted EBITDA. This amount includes $5 million in equity income from the JVs, which is non-cash, so therefore deducted to reach a cash figure, but then add back the cash distributions from the JVs, which this quarter were $2 million.",
         "We expect \u2013 we expected $17 million in drydocking and CapEx. Cash interest and principal payment on our debt was $30 million. I\u2019m only taking into account the $22 million that was cash return to shareholders in the positive impact of working capital and other non-cash charges of $11 million. The net result was that we ended the quarter with $144 million of cash and $40 million of undrawn revolver, yielding total liquidity of $184 million.",
         "Now if we could go to Slide 13, I\u2019d like to briefly talk about our balance sheet. As of June 30, 2020, we had $1.8 billion of assets, compared to $523 million of long-term debt and $81 million short-term. In addition, as mentioned, we had a $40 million revolving credit facility, that remained undrawn as of June 30.",
         "As you can see on the right-side of the slide, our net debt to total cap stands at 30%, where our net loan-to-value of our conventional fleet stands at 38%. As you \u2013 footnote 1 tells you take that \u2013 that is not taking account the value of our FSO, if you include that in book value of the net debt number drops to 34%.",
         "I\u2019d also call your attention to footnote 2. Since its Q2 in the books, our LTM EBITDA $266 million means that debt to EBITDA is just 2.3 times and therefore, as footnote 2 indicates with the metrics \u2013 that kind of metric means that our margin will drop from 260 basis points to 240 basis points on the core facility.",
         "Now finally, before turning the call back over to Lois, I\u2019d like to briefly discuss our share repurchase program. During the first six months of the year, we repurchased $30 million of shares. Specifically, during the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased 490,592 shares at an average price of $20.41 per share for a total cost of $10 million.",
         "During the second quarter, we repurchased 926,700 shares at an average price of $21.37 per share for a total cost of $20 million. For year-to-date total of $30 million, which represented nearly repurchasing nearly 5% of our outstanding shares. In August, our Board authorized a renewal of the share repurchase program in the amount of $30 million.",
         "That concludes my financial remarks. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back to Lois for her closing comments."

      "Lois Zabrocky": [
         "Thank you very much, James. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining International Seaways earnings call to discuss our second quarter 2020 results.",
         "Before we discuss our strongest quarterly results since our inception, please turn to Slide 4 for an update on our COVID-19 response. We are continuously working to serve and keep safe our onshore and at-sea professionals.",
         "First onshore, we\u2019ve maintained full staffing capabilities with our employees all working remotely since March 16. We will continue to evaluate our return to our New York and Houston offices, based upon our highest priority, the safety of our staff.",
         "Our commercial and technical operations, finance and administrative departments, continue to run smoothly. We completed the quarterly close on time, all SEC reporting requirements have been done without delay. Seaways ability to operate smoothly during this challenging time is a testament to the team\u2019s dedication and we thank everyone for their continued hard work and commitment to Seaways.",
         "Regarding our crew, we\u2019ve implemented strict measures on all of our ships to ensure the safety of our seafarers and we have had no COVID cases to date on Board. We are implementing these procedures not only while they\u2019re on Board, but also while we are traveling to and from the vessels.",
         "As we discussed last quarter, global travel restrictions have made it exceptionally difficult to rotate our crews. We continue to support industry efforts to designate seafarers as key workers and to allow them to return home to their families after many months at sea.",
         "To meet this important objective, we have deviated vessels where possible, to help facilitate safe and effective crew changes. Given that many of our dedicated crew members have been on board vessels for longer than the original contract. The situation remains incredibly dynamic. As an example, one of our VLCC crew was disappointed to have a full-flight of relievers from Manila to Singapore canceled by the airline at the last minute. We are working now on finding the next best opportunity to get the seafarers home.",
         "Another example with an enormous amount of effort and coordination across the three continents, we were successful relieving 20 seafarers at Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. We thank all of our seafarers for their professionalism and their commitment throughout this extremely challenging circumstances.",
         "From an operational standpoint, we have not yet seen material cost increases due to COVID-19. While we have confronted certain challenges, including difficulty arranging Sire inspections from the oil major customers and other inspections, as well as delays transporting spare parts, our operations are running smoothly.",
         "Going forward, and especially as we continue to operate amid the global pandemic, our priorities remain, the safety of our onshore and at-sea professionals and providing best-in-class service to our leading energy customers.",
         "If you\u2019ll turn to Slide 5, we review our second quarter 2020 highlights and our recent accomplishment. Our quarterly performance was very strong. We\u2019re pleased to have posted our second consecutive quarter of record earnings, while continuing to implement our disciplined and accretive capital allocation strategy, unlocking value for our shareholders.",
         "Turning to the first bullet, we highlight our significant operating leverage and success capitalizing on the robust rate environment, in the second quarter. We once again generated our highest quarterly net income as a public company. For the quarter, we earned a net income of $68.5 million, excluding items related to an impairment and the gain on the sale of vessels, or $2.39 per share.",
         "Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $96 million, representing a year-over-year increase of $75 million and quarter-over-quarter increase of $22 million. With our strong results and during a time when we continue to return capital to shareholders, we ended the quarter with $184 million in total liquidity, including cash and our $40 million undrawn revolver.",
         "Moving to the next bullet. Our strong Q2 results have extended into the third quarter, notably, with significant exposure to the VLCC market and to the mid-sized tanker sectors. We have already booked over half of our third quarter revenue days at profitable rates. Additionally, we capitalized on the elevated market in the second quarter and we entered into favorable time charters, which strengthen our earnings prospects moving forward.",
         "Specifically, we secured four VLCC time charters, for periods ranging from seven to 36 months at an average of $73,000 per day. We have positioned International Seaways to optimize revenue, during the time, when rates have come off their high.",
         "Lastly, we further executed on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy with an intense focus on providing returns to shareholders. We maintained our balance sheet strength and enhanced our capital structure.",
         "Specifically, in addition to the repurchase of $10 million of our shares in the first quarter, we completed the repurchase of an additional $20 million of our shares during the second quarter. This brings our total purchases to just under 5% of our outstanding shares. We believe this was an attractive opportunity for Seaways to unlock value, given our stock valuation relative to our NAV.",
         "We took further steps to delever the company and we are in the process of repaying the full $40 million outstanding under our transition term loan facility in August. This will reduce our already low cash break-even by an additional $1,800 per day to under $15,000 per day. Once the repayment is made, we will have 14 unencumbered vessels with more than $200 million.",
         "We continue to have one of the lowest leverage profiles in the public shipping sector, with our net loan-to-value further improving to 38%. Our liquidity has allowed us the flexibility to continue to deploy capital to best serves shareholders. In June, we paid our regular quarterly dividend of $0.06 and our Board has approved another regular quarterly $0.06 dividend to be paid in September.",
         "Our priority is to continue optimizing how we allocate the capital throughout the cycle, In addition to repurchasing close to 5% of our outstanding shares, which we discussed a moment ago, this is including capitalizing on attractive asset values at the bottom of the cycle, prepaying $40 million of debt and providing shareholders with dividends, totaling $0.12 since implementing our policy this year.",
         "In order to ensure that we remain well-positioned to act opportunistically, subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized a new $30 million share repurchase program for Seaways.",
         "Turning to Slide 6, we provide an update on oil supply and demand. The economic impacts of COVID-19 have reduced the demand for oil. Recently, the IEA has taken a more positive view on demand restoration, increasing their demand forecast to 92 million barrels per day for all of 2020 and 97 million barrels per day for 2021. This is largely driven by the strength of Chinese demand and delays at discharge ports in China, which are due to the logistical issues dealing with record imports. And this has reduced the effective VLCC fleet size.",
         "While down from 100 million barrels per day achieved in 2019, the IEA forecast represents a significant increase from previous estimates and reflects demand for oil in the second-half of 2020, given that large segments of the global economy were abruptly halted earlier in the year in response to COVID-19.",
         "On the supply side, after extending agreements to curb production in June, OPEC has agreed to ease these cuts and is expected to produce an additional 2 million barrels per day in August. Regarding U.S. shale production, the EIA estimates a 2 million barrels per day reduction in August from its peak in March due to pressures from low oil prices.",
         "During the second quarter, we saw strong demand for floating storage due to a steep oil price contango. However, as can be seen in the chart on the right-hand of the slide, as global oil demand recovers and production decrease, the price contango flattened and this deemphasized the need for new floating storage, while inventory destocking began.",
         "Although, we remain positive on the long-term outlook for the tanker market, the combination of June OPEC production cuts, reduced demand for floating storage and inventory destocking, we have pushed rates down from the highs that we saw earlier this year.",
         "On Slide 7, an update on ship supply. Overall, the tanker order book remains historically low. You can see this on the chart at the top right-hand of the slide. Only 10 Vs have been ordered in 2020 to date and 31 were ordered in the full-year of 2019, uncertainty regarding the current market as well as decarbonization and a lack of suitable propulsion systems to meet decarbonization goals continue to temper new ordering.",
         "Moving to the bottom half of the slide. The VLCC fleet is aging with nearly a quarter of the existing fleet now over 15 years old, as depicted in the chart at the bottom right. Ships 20 years or older have grown by nearly 3 million deadweight from last quarter, an increase of 19%.",
         "As we have noted consistently and previously, once vessels reach 15 years of age, they are more expensive to operate with significant investments required to continue to trade. As ships reach ballast water treatment deadlines, even greater capital expenditure is necessary.",
         "Scrapping has been limited during the last 18 months, due to the market recovery, but the potential for scrapping has been building based on the aging fleets. There have been no VLCCs scrapped thus far in 2020. As rates moderate, scrapping is likely to increase.",
         "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff to provide additional details on our second quarter results. Jeff?",
         "Thanks a lot, Jeff. We\u2019re excited with our second quarter earnings. We generated our second consecutive quarter of record. Taking advantage of the robust market and we further implemented our disciplined and accretive capital allocation strategy, our substantial operating leverage was evident in the second quarter. This enabled us to generate are highest earnings per share since going public, ending the quarter with $184 million in total liquidity, which includes the $144 million in cash.",
         "The strong second quarter results have extended into the third quarter and we\u2019re pleased to have booked over half of our revenue days at healthy rates. In addition to attractive spot bookings, we\u2019ve capitalized on the elevated market and we entered into a number of highly profitable charters ranging from seven to 36 months and averaging $73,000 per day through the third quarter.",
         "During a time when rates have come off their highs, this success positions us to optimize our revenues. Finally, our success executing on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy has allowed us to provide a return to shareholders, while ensuring our balance sheet and our capital structure positions us well for the long-term.",
         "Complementing our repurchase of $20 million worth of shares in this quarter, our payment of our regular $0.06 dividend during the quarter, as well as the approval by the Board of another regular quarterly dividend of $0.06 to be paid in September, we are prepaying the full $40 million outstanding under our transition term loan facility this month. This will reduce our already low break-even by an additional $1,800 per day to under $15,000 per day.",
         "We entered the third quarter with a net loan-to-value of 38%, ample liquidity and flexibility to continue to further implement our capital allocation. Consistent with our focus on acting opportunistically, our Board authorized a new $30 million share repurchase program, which will provide us with additional opportunities to unlock value for shareholders. We\u2019ve also booked almost 70% of our Q3 VLCC days at a fixed rate of $58,000 per day.",
         "Going forward, we remain positive on the long-term outlook for the tanker market and our priority is to provide safe, reliable service to our leading energy customers and to ensure the safety of our onshore and at-sea professionals, as we continue to operate in the challenging COVID-19 environment.",
         "Thank you very much. And we\u2019d now like to open it up for questions."

Clearly, you guys have generated a lot of cash over the past three quarters, you\u2019ve refinanced, delevered, you built up a sizable cash balance, you\u2019ve started the dividend and you\u2019ve been very active buying back stock. And on top of that, you\u2019ve got the $200 million of unencumbered assets.",
            "So really a plenty of flexibility. And I just wanted to ask, what are your updated thoughts on the VLCCs, the older ones built in 2002, 2003, you\u2019ve got three of them. That we\u2019ve noticed that one of them is obviously earning a nice contract this quarter, or for the next, I think it\u2019s 12 months. But generally, we\u2019ve seen the other two really, a real separation between the earnings of those versus the modern vessels.",
            "And so just thinking, as you keep thinking about the longer-term story at International Seaways and keeping just the existing market footprint, what\u2019s your thought of just selling those two or three VLCCs and then taking the proceeds, replacing them with three modern VLs, and so you\u2019re not putting any strain on the balance sheet, you\u2019re just simply rejuvenating the existing footprint?"

I mean, obviously the \u2013 when we talk about being 70% or 69% booked in the third quarter at 58 a day, that includes those three older vessels, as you know. In this quarter, absolutely, their spot earnings have been about 24 day on the three older vessels, the one that\u2019s on time charters is almost 52. And then if you go back and look at Q1, they were actually the older vessels earned just as much as the modern ships.",
            "So I would say that, we have done well with these ladies and we\u2019re generating a lot of cash on them. That having been said, we indeed will opportunistically look at marketing these over two ships as appropriate and look to be \u2013 take advantage of the best opportunities we can.",
            "And when you recap, quite beautifully there the things that we\u2019ve been doing, you see we\u2019ve been buying back shares. I love this $15,000 per day, below that for cash break-even in this environment, all of those things are really strong. And as we go through this part in the cycle, then we will turn our eyes toward regenerating the fleet. It might be a little bit early at the moment, but that\u2019s something that we will definitely look at, when we think that\u2019s the right way, the best way to deploy our capital."

The MRs, however, you\u2019ve got four of them, and they seem a bit non-core, especially the earnings power seems to be very range bound in that particular segment.",
            "So it\u2019s either you have a bunch of MRs or you charter a bunch in, what are you thinking about that piece of the business? Do you monetize those ships in the near-term or you still just want to hold on to them? I know that there is probably no debt on them. How do you think about those vessels?"

It seems \u2013 as we look at where reported spot rates are, just kind of curious how we should think about that? It seems like an upcycles vessels tend to never actually earn those kind of high levels that are being reported. Kind of curious, like how we should be thinking about it now, where we\u2019re kind of in a trough levels, how we should think about the performance of the ships versus kind of those reported rates?"

It\u2019s much appreciated. Indeed, when the market is running and you\u2019re seeing VLCC rates being reported at over $100,000 per day, what happens is that, the market is running up and it\u2019s \u2013 the vessels that are in that window that are able to fix those rates, I mean, overall, it\u2019s very strong.",
            "And you\u2019ll see that, in order for us to secure 30% of our Vs or four out of 13 on these time charters that we got, we pulled plumb positions, right? So those were a lot of May lifting dates. In order to lock-in on those two, seven months charters on the Vs 100 grand a day.",
            "So, that was something \u2013 it\u2019s really almost a spot decision when you\u2019re doing something six or seven months in a VLCC, because that\u2019s really only a couple of voyages. But likewise, I would say, with what\u2019s booked in Q to date for the third quarter, you also see \u2013 you don\u2019t see the market on Vs today is $20,000 to $25,000 per day.",
            "You don\u2019t see Q3 booked at that, because we\u2019ve had vessels that have been delayed. And discharging, we\u2019ve been able to secure higher rates going into the quarter. The open days on the vessels are indeed lower at present, but Q3 is always your lowest demand quarter. So I think that the market, particularly on the Vs has held up remarkably for the type of demand destruction that we have seen."

And none of the peer group reports that top ticking rate for the whole quarter.",

            "Now with that, why did you choose to repay the transition facility instead of maybe the more expensive 8.5 senior notes? Was it solely to unencumbered the ships or just a larger principal balance? And then what are your plans for those kind of 8.5% senior notes?"

            "Well, sure. Thanks, Randy. We looked at the both. The 8.5% notes, which are just $25 million in total amount became callable at anytime. So it\u2019s a little early, I guess, in June \u2013 end of June, so that\u2019s definitely an option. That option is still out there. We can call it \u2013 effectively, you had to call it in whole, because that\u2019s sort of the minimum listening requirements in New York Stock Exchange.",
            "So we thought about it, but we decided, along with our Board, that we would prioritize the transition loans being the first thing that we would take in, because while it\u2019s the second most expensive, or price loan, it is secured, it was low loan-to-value. A \u2013 really, as the name implies, a temporary loan that we did as part of facilitating and refinancing our old term loan B, if we had this much cash in January, as we do today, we wouldn\u2019t have needed the transition loan at all.",
            "So it just seemed logical to us to remove that. As you mentioned, you get 12 more unencumbered ships to go to. We already had, those 14 unencumbered ships worth $200 million in today\u2019s market. And even at scrap, they\u2019re worth about half of that. So tremendous optionality and flexibility of having unencumbered vessels. It\u2019s really like gold.",

As Lois alluded to, that\u2019s gradually part of the plan, or we could borrow again some if we needed to or wanted to. So all that kind of optionality. And then meanwhile, the 8.5% unsecured is a relatively good price for unsecured. And we always can take a look at it quarter-by-quarter and then make that sort of the next \u2013 could be the next capital allocations, I think. But we also want to have dry powder for further allocations, like further share repurchases. So I hope that answers your question, Randy."

That hurts regionally the western Aframax market. Then, I would particularly say, on the Product Carriers, you\u2019ve just seen such an incredible volatility. The LR2s had really were superstars there for a while and then came down dramatically.",

So those are the couple of ways we \u2013 we\u2019ve seen some of the trends manifesting themselves. We\u2019ve still seen over or close to 3 million barrels a day, still crude exporting out of the U.S. Gulf.

So that, when we see that that\u2019s the right capital allocation decision, we can exercise that. And I would simply say that, for us right now, in this environment of COVID-19, has been very tricky. And I think that we are very actively and very carefully looking at what\u2019s the best way to allocate our capital. And then I\u2019ll flip it over to Jeff, maybe for a little more detail."

But it\u2019s not an easy. As I think, we\u2019ve used expression, it\u2019s a little foggy \u2013 the view from the bridge is a little foggy about how long that cycle is going to last is because it involves factors that no management team can control, what OPEC can do, as demand kind of return, and things like that.",

And so \u2013 and as you know, we always sort of take a balanced view on things that\u2019s kind of our style. And so we absolutely like having the program re-upped. So we have the flexibility to do it if it makes sense. But we\u2019re \u2013 and we are also keeping in mind, the needs \u2013 other needs that we have eventually for renewing our fleet, et cetera.",

I mean, that lower ordering book is really as owners keep having to see, okay, what\u2019s going to be the next effective technology that isn\u2019t just an intellectual idea, but that can actually be manifested. And I think that that\u2019s really going to affect fleet development.",

And then you look at, \u201cOkay, how is the industry going to change and what will be the proven technology that\u2019s really going to suit our needs going forward? So I think that really, even during COVID-19 when you have all these urgent issues and everybody is a huge effort to to coordinate crew repatriation stuff, you still have to have your eye on the ball.

We just think it\u2019s good to work it down to lower levels, because then you can always relever to help you make a capital allocation decision that\u2019s smart, whether that\u2019s buying a vessel, because you\u2019ve got to the right time to do it, or a few vessels or doing more share repurchasing or whatever it is.

            "Thanks, Lois. Thanks, Jeff. It sounds like yes, sounds like not really statistically significant. But there, obviously, is a big spread between the two classes. We covered a lot of the leverage stuff. I just had a quick sort of question for Jeff. I noticed you\u2019ve swapped a lot of that stuff out on LIBOR earlier in the year and you\u2019ve got great swap rates at the time, right?",
            "But the swaps have came down right in price since then. Can you remind us I don\u2019t if you have this in front of you, or a rough estimate of what your total all-in bank debt cost is? It looks like it\u2019s around 4%, which is hard to believe. Is that right? Or can you remind us about?"

            "Oh, I think, if you include \u2013 I mean, now you\u2019ve got the spreads are 240 going to be going forward and \u2013 on the Sinosure and two, sorry, on the core facility and 200 on the Sinosure and then you got the LIBOR. And if you include the swap, we\u2019re still going to be between 4% and 5% for those because of having done some swaps earlier on, while at the Sinosure credit facility came with a swap.",
            "So that was what we have done. We just did something in this quarter. It\u2019s in the queue, go look it up, like that talks about taking advantage of the lower rates that we have now by extending out in time the swap that\u2019s on the Sinosure credit facility, otherwise it would have expired in 2025. We pushed it out to 2027, and that has the effect of saving about 40 basis points of where LIBOR swapped into there.",
            "So I think you\u2019re probably right that with the 8.5%, only being $25 million that they are probably all-in cost is probably around into the 4% and 5% range as you said."

            "Thanks, Jeff. Yes, it is a legacy facility, it looks like right on the Sinosure. But I did see the blending and that was pretty impressive out there to 2027. I think it was like 2.3% or something. So good job on that.",
            "Last question for you, FSO joint venture with Euronav, right? It comes up for renewal in 2022. I know previous commentary we danced around it a little bit with Euronav as well. Kind of the broad expectation is that those have a life still about 2032, at least. Now that was a little bit prior to some of the recent carnage in the market we\u2019ve seen. So I guess, a little part one on that is \u2013 are those FSOs still steady and operating full utilization and all that? And then I guess, part two is when do those negotiations and discussions began? Are we already in that phase or is that like a year out?"

So they\u2019ve been extremely highly serviceable on that field and we do expect them to continue to have at least another 10 years of life \u2013so \u2013 or 12 till 2032. And then we are constantly in touch with our customer. And when we give you more solid detail, we\u2019ll do that."
