         "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your family are in good health. I will start my opening remarks by addressing the pandemic, followed by our third quarter highlights. Fran\u00e7ois will then provide comments on the financial results. ",
         "So when we last spoke in April, we were a few weeks into the pandemic. It seems like ages ago, and while the peak of the crisis is behind us, we are still operating in what can only be described as challenging and unusual times. Our teams continue to do an excellent job to ensure that store operations and the supply chain run efficiently while never compromising on the safety of our employees and customers. ",
         "As we disclosed this morning, we incurred $107 million of COVID-19-related expenses in the third quarter. About half of these expenses represent the temporary wage increase and special bonus for frontline employees, with the remainder related to cleaning and disinfecting store greeters, signage, personal protection equipment, et cetera. ",
         "Our food business experienced high levels of sales as a large portion of restaurant and foodservice sales transferred to the grocery channel. We disclosed last April that our same-store sales for the first 4-week period of our third quarter were up 25%. And we realized same-store sales of 15.6% for the entire 16-week third quarter. We continue to see fewer visits, more than compensated by a larger basket size. ",
         "Sales of our conventional banner in both provinces continue to perform very well as many customers opt to shop more locally and are still growing faster than our discount store sales, which are doing quite well also. The growth gap between conventional and discount has narrowed, and we expect that it will continue to do so. This strong performance is reflected in our growing market share in both Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario. ",
         "Our pharmacy business delivered a balanced performance of plus 1% total same-store sales growth in the third quarter. We are pleased with this result given the very challenging operating conditions of our pharmacies in the first half of the quarter. Our pharmacists' ability to maintain the quality of service through this period, notably through expanding home delivery services and leveraging our expanded online pharmacy capabilities, was key in delivering prescription same-store sales growth of 2.7%. ",
         "We indicated in April that front-end sales were down 9% for the first 4 weeks of the third quarter because of the initial pantry loading of essential items that happened late in the second quarter, restricted physical access as well as the reduction in promotional activity as safety measures were initially rolled out. ",
         "While we are still seeing lower in-store traffic, larger baskets driven by key categories, including OTC and beauty, have helped offset some of this impact in the latter part of the quarter. Overall, we ended the quarter with a 2.5% decline in front-end same-store sales. ",
         "I would now like to turn to our online food business. Because of COVID, online food sales were up 280% in the third quarter, albeit from a very small base last year. Today, the size of that business is at a level we had forecasted to reach in 2 or 3 years. As a result, we are accelerating our plan to add capacity, and we are finalizing work to evolve our current hub store model to better meet the growing demand. We have learned a lot in the last 4 years, and we will be leveraging the investments we made in building teams and expertise in the delivery of full fresh basket to the homes of Qu\u00e9beckers and Ontarians, including robust technologies and competencies in customer web interface, picking and home delivery. ",
         "In the short term, after adding a second hub store in Qu\u00e9bec City earlier this year, we have just added a new hub store in Sherbrooke, Qu\u00e9bec, bringing to 9 the total number of stores in Qu\u00e9bec offering our online service. In Ontario, we will be adding a third hub store in Scarborough in October to serve the east end of the GTA. We will also be expanding our click-and-collect offer, with some 30 additional stores in Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario offering this service in fiscal '21. These stores will not offer a delivery service. Finally, as previously announced, we have partnered with Cornershop for Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario to serve customers wanting same-day, 2-hour delivery service, and we are pleased with the results so far.",
         "Loyalty will remain a cornerstone of our online strategy. Our best-in-class loyalty program and partnership with dunnhumby is allowing us to engage customers both online and in-store in a proven omnichannel strategy. Our disciplined approach allows us to gain share through increased customer loyalty and new customer acquisition. We are leveraging our expertise and brand strength focused on fresh to deliver a good experience in store and online. ",
         "Turning now to our third quarter. We delivered strong results with same-store sales up 15.6% and adjusted EPS up 20%. Our internal food basket inflation was 3%, up from 2% in the previous quarter, with the meat category continuing to be the main driver. On the pharmacy side, as I mentioned earlier, same-store sales grew by 1%, with a 2.7% increase in prescription drugs and a decrease of 2.5% in front-end sales. We are encouraged by the overall performance of our pharma division through this challenging period and have now resumed the integration activities that were interrupted during the crisis, such as the rollout of the Jean Coutu lab and POS retail systems to our Brunet pharmacies in the coming weeks.",
         "Our Ontario supply chain modernization project is back on track after being delayed for a few weeks. Both projects are well underway, and the interior fit-up work is ongoing, including installation of automation systems. Some German nationals responsible for the automation part of the project have obtained clearance from the authorities to come to Canada and are now working on both sites. The start-up of our new fresh DC has been postponed from September of this year to January of 2021. Our retail CapEx program remains on track. So far this year, we opened 6 new stores, relocated another 2 and renovated 11 stores for a net square footage addition of 130,000 square feet or 0.6%. ",
         "Investments in technology at the retail level are also ongoing. And by the end of this fiscal year, we expect to have about 100 stores equipped with electronic shelf labels, plus another 100 stores coming in F '21. Also, 200 stores will have self-checkouts at the end of the year, and another 120 stores are planned for 2021. Customer use of self-checkouts is increasing steadily, and we are meeting our ROI targets. Looking ahead, while it is impossible to predict how long this pandemic will continue and exactly what impact it will have on long-term customer shopping patterns, we do expect that in the short term, food revenues will continue to grow at higher-than-normal rates versus last year. After 4 weeks in the fourth quarter, food same-store sales are up by about 10%. On the pharmacy side, front-end sales growth is above 6%. ",
         "In closing, let me thank all my colleagues for their outstanding work during this challenging period. I want to reiterate that the safety of our employees and our customers remains our top priority as we continue to invest in our stores, our supply chain and our merchandising programs to best meet the needs of our customers and ensure our long-term growth.

         "That's it for me. I will now turn it over to Fran\u00e7ois."

      "Fran\u00e7ois Thibault": [
         "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter sales reached $5.8 billion versus $5.2 billion last year, an increase of 11.6%. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, the sales increase stands at 11.9%. As Eric mentioned, food same-store sales grew 15.6% versus last year, and pharma grew 1%. Of note, we will no longer report the variation in script count for the time being as the changes in script delivery frequency, notably around compliance packaging scripts moving to a monthly versus weekly delivery, by having a significant impact on screw count variations versus the prior year. So we'll therefore focus on same-store dollar sale as a main comparison metric. ",
         "Our gross margin stood at 20% of sales or 20.3% excluding IFRS 16, and that compares to 19.7% for the same period last year. A bigger basket size and higher sales in our conventional banner contributed to the gross margin improvement. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 10.7% or 12% without the impact of IFRS 16, and this compares to operating expenses of 11.6% of sales for the same period last year. The increase in operating expenses is primarily the result of COVID-19-related expenses totaling $107 million, of which about half represents the temporary hourly wage increase and bonus paid to our frontline employees. The increase was partially mitigated by a reduction in other operating expenses. ",
         "Cost synergies related to the Jean Coutu acquisition amounted to $23 million in this quarter, and we have now secured an annual run rate of $70 million of cost synergies. Our EBITDA for the quarter stood at $542.9 million, representing a margin of 9.3% of sales versus 8.1% of sales for the same quarter last year. Again, excluding the IFRS 16 impact, EBITDA was up $60.4 million or 14.3% and represented 8.3% of sales. ",
         "Adjusted net earnings were $272.3 million compared to $230.3 million last year. That's an increase of 18.2%. And our adjusted net earnings per share were $1.08, up 20% versus last year. Our cash flow from operating activities stood at $512 million. That's a solid increase of $107 million versus the level generated last year. Our total capital expenditures in the quarter totaled about $136 million. ",
         "As mentioned during our last call, some projects have been delayed due to the pandemic, and we now expect our total CapEx for the fiscal year to total north of $475 million. Under our normal course issuer bid, we repurchased 3.16 million shares between November 25, 2019, and July 31 of this year at an average share price of $54.96 for a total consideration of $174 million. Our financial position remains very strong. ",
         "That's it for me. We will now take your questions."

         "Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Our comments will focus on the financial results of our third quarter, which ended July 4, 2020. With me today is Mr. Eric La Fl\u00e8che, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Fran\u00e7ois Thibault, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. ",
         "During the call, we will present our third quarter results and comment on its highlights. We will then be happy to take your questions. ",
         "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that we will use in today's discussion different statements that could be construed as forward-looking information. In general, any statement which does not constitute a historical fact may be deemed as a forward-looking statement. Expressions such as expect, intend, plan, are confident that, will and other similar expressions are generally indicative of forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are based upon certain assumptions regarding the Canadian food and pharmaceutical industries, the general economy and our annual budget as well as our 2019/'20 action plan. These forward-looking statements do not provide any guarantees as to the future performance of the company and are subject to potential risks, known and unknown, as well as uncertainties that could cause the outcome to differ materially. A description of these risks which could have an impact on these statements can be found under the Risk Management section of our 2019 annual report. ",
         "As with the preceding risks, the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a risk that could have an impact on the business, operations, projects, synergies, performance of the company and the realization of the forward-looking statements used in today's discussion. We believe these statements to be reasonable and pertinent at this time and represent our expectations. The company does not intend to update any forward-looking information, except as required by applicable law. ",

Wondering if you could just give us a little more granularity on what traffic versus basket was kind of as we go from that 25% comp to the 15.6% for the quarter and then into the 10% for the quarter-to-date. And wondering also within that, if you could talk a little bit about the gap and how that's narrowed more granularly on discount versus conventional."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Well, like I said in my opening statement, we continue to see declines in traffic, more than compensated by a large basket. I would say that over the quarter, the traffic declines have improved in all of our banners. They're still down, but they have improved, both in food and pharmacy, and within food, conventional and discount. ",
            "The big difference is the basket growth has been higher in conventional than it has been in discount. It's high in both, and we have -- we're very pleased with our comp sales in both formats. We're not going to disclose by format, but I can tell you that the gap is not that big. It's there, but it's not that big. We have healthy sales in both conventional and discount. We're growing share in both of our markets. And we're very happy with that performance."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And then -- okay. And then in terms of the COVID cost, the $107 million, obviously, you gave us the split this quarter. Can you just give us a little more color on how we should think about that into 4Q and then beyond in terms of lingering costs? Should we assume kind of 50% lingers, but on a 12-week basis?"

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So if you assume about half is the temporary wage increase, you can assume that half is remaining. But some of these -- some of the COVID expenses are behind us, like the plexiglass shields and the donations that we made. ",
            "So listen, if you just take the half of the $107 million, it would be about $13 million a period -- or a 4-week period. If you adjust for these -- some of the expenses that are behind us, it will be lower. I think $10 million to $12 million a period -- a 4-week period is probably as good a guess as you can have. Obviously, we will spend what we need to spend to make sure that we react to any measures that we have to take. But that's about a good run rate, I would say, going forward."

      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "No. We chose not to disclose that in our MD&A. And for competitive reasons, we prefer not to disclose that number. I'd just like to add a little more color to the traffic basket question that you just asked. So conventional is growing faster than discount. But I can tell you that the traffic declines are smaller in discount than they were -- they are in conventional. Although the traffic declines are improving, we've seen the transaction count decline smaller in discount than conventional. So conventional is benefiting from a huge lift in the basket. Higher traffic declines, huge basket lift. Traffic declines in discount, although albeit smaller than discount, compensated by also a higher basket, which was already higher to start with. So that's the picture."

In Metro stores, hot food cases, cut fruit, some of these departments were negatively impacted and we reduced hours in those departments. The hours were allocated elsewhere in the store for COVID situations. But that's what we mean by mitigation of extra expenses generated by COVID were mitigated by -- as best we could, reductions in costs elsewhere in the business."

I'm just wondering, how does that work in Qu\u00e9bec, where I believe you have, I don't know if you call them franchise stores and associate stores and stores where Metro may have a minority part of the equity and the owner has a larger portion of equity?

They tend to follow our programs that we do on the corporate and franchise side. So we're working with them. Some of them have already started to implement self-checkouts and electronic shelf labels. And we expect them to invest along -- the same way that we do. So we're starting with our corporate and franchise stores, and affiliates will tag along."

And it has leveled off since, but it's still much higher than it used to be. So that has put a lot of stress on our teams, where we pick in a few stores and deliver. I think they did a fantastic job managing that surge to deliver a decent experience. It's been a challenge. It's far from perfect. And we need to improve, and we will improve it. So I'm not going to give you a rating other than to say that under the circumstances, I think we did well. But clearly, it's something that will need to be refined and improved. ",
            "So the evolution that I talked about, we have invested in technologies and training for our people. We will be leveraging that. We will continue to leverage that as we evolve the hub store model to serve the growing demand. For competitive reasons, I am not going to say more. And when we're ready to announce anything more, we will. But right now, this is it."

And I know you don't give commentary specific to the food and pharmacy segment, but just wondering if you could give us any sense of the relative performance for each of those in terms of materiality to the consolidated results. ",
            "And then specific to the food business. Obviously, lots of other moving parts beyond the basket size and channel mix. You touched on the shutting down of prepared foods or at least the lower demand there. But also presumably, there's lower promotional penetration. So just wondering if you could talk through some of those dynamics and how you've seen that sort of evolve through the course of the quarter."

         "Speaker": "Mark Petrie"
      },
      "31": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, there's not -- the essential takeaway is basket size and channel mix that favors -- or that increased our gross margin a bit. The environment remains very promotional. It's very competitive out there. Our promotional ratios were down quite a bit early in the quarter, have resumed to more normal levels. So it's not quite as promotional as a year ago because of the larger basket size. The bigger the baskets, proportionately, there's a bit less items on promotion in there as people do the full, full shop. But that's the main story: basket size, channel mix. ",

And you mentioned the OTC and beauty as sort of driving that. I'm just wondering, how much of that growth is sort of catch-up sales versus a structural change as the demand for convenience channel remains elevated because of the virus? Just trying to get a sense of how sustainable that 6% is. Because, as you know, historically, sort of 2% to 3% has been the long-term average. I'm wondering if there's going to be a step-up longer-term because of the virus."

It's offset by declines in cosmetics and some other categories that are not doing as well because of COVID. So it's a mix at the front end there. ",

But essentially, our Metro banners are your local supermarket, community supermarket; high frequency, people go a couple of times, 3 times, 4 times a week, and do a shop; sometimes a full shop, sometimes not -- just a convenience top up. With the COVID, people are going to stores less frequently. That's obvious. You all know that. So the average basket size in a conventional store is lower than a discount store, in our case. So the customer that used to go twice a week or used to go to different stores and now shops in one conventional store is doing a full shop. And that's what we saw during the COVID so -- in all departments, fresh, grocery, dairy, frozen, all of them up. ",
            "Grocery, dry grocery, especially, had huge surge in sales in our conventional stores because people were shopping less frequently and doing a much bigger shop. So that's the explanation for the significant increase in the basket in our conventional stores. Maybe these people have more money in their pockets. Maybe -- not maybe, but they're going less to restaurants. They're reading at home 3 times a day. They're working from home. So they are spending more money in our Metro stores. ",

Basket is up, although less so than in the Metro stores. But we're happy with the growth there, too. I think we're seeing healthy comp sales growth in our discount stores. We're seeing market share gains in our -- also in our discount stores. So happy with that and good execution for our teams. I hope that answers the question."

With multi-format, conventional discount, Adonis, Premi\u00e8re Moisson, I think we're well positioned to serve our customers for all their food shopping needs.

Clearly, people are trying it or have tried it for the first time. Hopefully, they will stick around. So yes, there were new customers acquired to generate the sales lift that we saw during this quarter. And we're getting, we think, more loyalty from existing Metro customers who shop both online and in store. We track that with our program, metro&moi, and we can see that we get a higher spend.

So yes, there's a reduction of about $13 million. A good chunk of that reduction is due, as we explained, because of the reduced hours elsewhere in terms of the departments that were affected by pandemic, like hot foods, cut fruit, deli, et cetera, others. So some of that, obviously, that's part of the explanation. But there's also regular cost-containment measures that we always do.
