      "Brian Lian": [
         "Thanks, Stephanie, and thanks to everyone listening on the webcast or by phone. Today, we\u2019ll provide an overview of our second quarter 2020 financial results, as well as an update on recent progress and developments related to our pipeline of programs and operations.",
         "I\u2019ll begin by reviewing the status of our ongoing Phase 2B VOYAGE trial study. As a reminder, this trial is evaluating our small molecule thyroid hormone beta receptor agonists, VK2809 in patients with biopsy confirmed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis.",
         "Enrollment in the trial continues and despite the ongoing pandemic more sites are open today for patient screening and enrollment, and fewer sites are reporting operational disruptions compared with two months ago. We currently anticipate completion of enrollment in this study in the first half of 2021. I\u2019ll provide more color on VOYAGE in a few minutes.",
         "During the quarter, we also made great progress with our second small molecule thyroid receptor beta agonist, VK0214, which we\u2019re developing as a potential treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. We\u2019re pleased to report that we recently filed an IND with the FDA to initiate the first in human studies of this important molecule. We plan to initiate these studies following clearance of the IND.",
         "I\u2019ll provide additional detail on our development activities after we review our second quarter financial results. For that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Zante, Viking\u2019s Senior Vice President of Finance. Greg?",
         "Thanks, Greg. I\u2019ll now provide an update on our recent development activities, beginning with our lead program, VK2809 for the treatment of NASH. As a reminder, VK2809 is an orally available small molecule agonists of the thyroid hormone receptor that possesses selectivity for liver tissue, as well as the beta receptor subtype, suggesting promising therapeutic potential in a range of metabolic disorders, including NASH.",
         "As we previously discussed, in a 12-week Phase 2 trial in patients with hypercholesterolemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, VK2809 produced statistically significant reductions in liver fat content, as well as improvements in LDL cholesterol, meeting the study\u2019s primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.",
         "On exploratory efficacy measures evaluating other plasma lipids such as triglycerides, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein (a) treatment with VK2809 also resulted in significant reductions. Importantly, the study showed VK2809 to possess an encouraging safety and tolerability profile, with no serious adverse events reported among patients receiving VK2809 or placebo.",
         "The initial data from this study were highlighted at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases or AASLD in 2018. Additional data, including efficacy at the low dose of 5 milligrams daily were presented at the International Liver Conference or EASL in 2019.",
         "As we indicated on our last quarterly call, further results from this study have been selected for oral presentation at the upcoming 2020 EASL meeting, which will be held in a virtual format from August 27th through August 29th. The VK2809 presentation will occur on Friday, August 28th.",
         "In our view, the data obtained thus far suggests that VK2809 possesses several differentiating characteristics relative to the current NASH development landscape. In addition to the potent reductions observed in liver fat, which we believe suggest promise for improvement in other histologic features, VK2809\u2019s broader efficacy on lipid measures suggests additional potential cardiometabolic benefits for patients with NASH.",
         "The compounds oral route of administration, liver targeted mode of action and encouraging safety and tolerability to-date, combined to place it among the most promising development programs in the NASH landscape today.",
         "Given the encouraging findings from the 12-week Phase 2 study, last year we initiated the 52-week Phase 2b study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VK2809 in patients with biopsy confirmed NASH and fibrosis.",
         "This study which we\u2019ve called the VOYAGE study is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled multicenter trial designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of VK2809 in the setting of NASH.",
         "The study is targeting enrollment of approximately 340 patients across five treatment arms, including 1 milligram daily, 2.5 milligrams daily, 5 milligrams every other day, 10 milligrams every other day and placebo. The target population includes patients with F2 and F3 fibrosis, as well as up to 25% with F1 fibrosis. F1 patients must possess additional risk factors to be eligible for enrollment.",
         "The primary endpoint of the study will evaluate the relative change in liver fat content, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, proton density fat fraction from baseline to week 12 in subjects treated with VK2809, as compared to subjects receiving placebo. Secondary objectives include evaluation of histologic changes assessed by hepatic biopsy after 52 weeks of therapy.",
         "We are currently enrolling patients in this study in the United States and we remain on track to open sites outside the U.S. later this quarter. As we reported in our last quarterly update, we continue to closely monitor site activities in the context of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic.",
         "To reiterate an important comment from our last update, we have never pause enrollment in this study or indicated to our sites that we plan to defer any activities required for trial execution. Since our last update, we\u2019re encouraged that sites continued to loosen many of the restrictions put in place earlier in the pandemic.",
         "We have more sites open for in-person and virtual payment -- patient engagement today than in prior months and anticipate further expansion of site activities in the coming months. In addition, we\u2019re pleased to report that dosing in this study has now exceeded six months and we look forward the completion of the plan 52-week treatment window that will enable the evaluation of VK2809 safety and efficacy on histologic endpoints in NASH.",
         "With respect to further expansion of clinical sites, we remain on track to open sites outside the U.S. later this year, in both the third and fourth quarters, and continue to target over 80 sites globally. As we\u2019ve previously indicated, we continue to anticipate completion of enrollment in VOYAGE in the first half of next year.",
         "I would now like provide an update on our VK0214 program. Like VK2809, VK0214 is an orally available small molecule thyroid hormone receptor agonist that possesses selectivity for the beta receptor subtype.",
         "We\u2019re developing VK0214 as a potential treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy or X-ALD. X-ALD is a serious degenerative neuromuscular disease for which no pharmacologic treatment exists.",
         "The disease is caused by a defect in the proximal transporter called ABCD1. This defect can result in increase plasma and tissue levels of very long chain fatty acids, which are believed to contribute to the cerebral and motor neuron toxicities that are characteristic of the disease.",
         "The thyroid beta receptor is an important potential target for therapeutic intervention in X-ALD because it is believed to play a role in very long chain fatty acid metabolism. Data from in vivo models have demonstrated that treatment with VK0214 produces reduction in very long chain fatty acids in both plasma and tissue. These encouraging findings suggest potential benefit in the setting of X-ALD and we\u2019re eager to move VK0214 into the clinic.",
         "To this end, we are pleased to report that we recently filed an IND for VK0214 to initiate the clinical development of this important program. Following clearance of the IND, we plan to initiate the first in human studies of VK0214, to be followed by initiation of a proof-of-concept study in patients with X-ALD. We will provide more details on trial design upon study initiation.",
         "As we advanced both VK2809 and VK0214, we continue to carefully manage our cash resources and maintain a strong financial position. As Greg stated earlier, we ended the second quarter with approximately $263 million in cash, which we currently expect will provide sufficient runway to achieve a number of the key clinical milestones that we believe will drive value creation in the future.",
         "In conclusion, we continue to make exciting progress with both our VK2809 and VK0214 programs. With respect to our Phase 2b VOYAGE trial evaluating VK2809 in patients with biopsy confirmed NASH and fibrosis, we\u2019ve increased the number of sites that are open and actively enrolling and look forward to adding new sites both within and outside the U.S. in the coming months.",
         "We\u2019re also happy to report that we passed the six-month dosing milestone and continue to treat subjects for the plan 52-week trial duration. We currently anticipate completion of enrollment in the first half of 2021.",
         "With respect to VK0214 for the treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, we recently filed an IND for this program and we expect to initiate clinical development in the third quarter.",
         "Finally, during the second quarter, we continued to carefully manage our cash to ensure that we have the resources to optimally advance our key programs through the critical milestones.",
         "This concludes our prepared comments for today. Thanks again for joining us and now we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Operator?"

         "Thanks, Brian. In conjunction with my comments, I\u2019d like to recommend that participants refer to Viking\u2019s Form 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we expect to file later today for additional details.",
         "I will now go over our financial results for the second quarter and for six months ended June 30, 2020. I will first go over the second quarter results.",
         "Our research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2020 were $7.8 million, compared to $7.3 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to our clinical studies, manufacturing for our drug candidates, salaries and benefits, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by decreased expenses related to preclinical studies and services provided by third-party consultants.",
         "Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2020 were $2.8 million, compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to stock-based compensation, legal expenses and insurance expenses, partially offset by decreased expenses related to services provided by third-party consultants and travel.",
         "For the three months ended June 30, 2020, Viking reported a net loss of $9.6 million or $0.13 per share, compared to a net loss of $7.7 million or $0.11 per share in the corresponding period of 2019. The increase in net loss and net loss per share for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to the increases in research and development and general and administrative expenses noted previously, as well as decreased interest income due to the decline in interest rates throughout the second quarter of 2020, as compared to prevailing interest rates during the second quarter of 2019.",
         "I\u2019ll now go over our results for the first six months of 2020. Our research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2020 were $15.8 million, compared to $11.8 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to our clinical studies, manufacturing for drug candidates, salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation, partially offset by decreased expenses related to services provided by third-party consultants and preclinical studies.",
         "Our general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2020 were $5.8 million, compared to $4.5 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to stock-based compensation, legal expenses and insurance expenses, partially offset by decreased expenses related to services provided by third-party consultants, professional fees and travel.",
         "For the six months ended June 30, 2020, Viking reported a net loss of $19.3 million or $0.27 per share, compared to a net loss of $12.6 million or $0.18 per share in the corresponding period in 2019. The increase in net loss and net loss per share for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to the increases in research and development and general and administrative expenses noted previously, as well as decrease interest income due to the decline in interest rates throughout the first half of 2020, as compared to prevailing interest rates during the first half of 2019.",
         "Turning to the balance sheet. At June 30, 2020 Viking held cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $263 million and had 72,758,342 shares of common stock outstanding.",
         "This concludes my financial review and I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Brian."

And then, what -- the other question I have is, one of your peer company Intercept received a disciplining CRL last month, we\u2019ve had when that come and the FDA stated that they did not believe the risk benefit justified approval. What are your thoughts on that CRL and how does this, if at all changed or developed -- development plans for VK2809?"

It\u2019s really a complicated question and I don\u2019t have a lot of insight on the nature of the CRL or any discussions Intercept may or may not have had with the FDA. As far as our plans, our plans are unchanged. We\u2019re going to complete the VOYAGE study and read those data outs and then plan for Phase 3 trial. And currently, the guidance is unchanged with the registration endpoints. So we are not altering our strategy at all. We look forward to completing the VOYAGE study. That\u2019s the main focus right now."

We\u2019re focused now on a Phase 2b study. We\u2019re looking at both the registration endpoints as secondary endpoints at 12 months. But it\u2019s tough to make that comparison just because they\u2019re just different molecules targeting different receptors and different mechanisms."

And we had originally targeted around 12 ex-U.S. and we\u2019ll be potentially moving that up to closer to 15.

And some of your competitors have hinted that they may be able to run registrational trials at -- with an endpoint of less than 52 weeks based on some of their data, from the data that you\u2019ve seen to-date, do you think that there\u2019s any chance that you will be able to run a trial that would be shorter than a 52-week Phase 3?"

The patients only received 12 weeks of therapy. So, we\u2019ll make that determination once we have our 12-month data in hand. But it\u2019s just hard to answer right now."

So it sounds like from an enrollment -- VOYAGE enrollment perspective, you\u2019re pretty optimistic on how things are progressing. And so, I\u2019m just wondering, is a gating factor in terms of your enrollment guidance more actually on the ex-U.S. side or is it still pulling it off patients through on the U.S. side? And then secondarily while I appreciate that it\u2019s somewhat a move point given that we pass the six month mark. Can you just maybe comment, did FDA actually come back and sort of bless VOYAGE to continue dosing or was it more a continuation of the no news is good news commentary that we saw last quarter? Thank you."

            "Yeah. Thanks Matt. So on the second question, there was never any requirement that we check in with the FDA at six months. The trial that was cleared to proceed was a 52-week trial and we were requested to submit our 12-month tox data at some timeframe before any subject reached that six-month threshold. So there wasn\u2019t any sort of a check in or, okay, or anything from the FDA. We didn\u2019t receive one. We didn\u2019t expect one of there was never a one outlined for us.",

And then we have enrollment assumptions in each of those sites and model it out from there. So it\u2019s a combination of U.S. and ex-U.S., and they\u2019re both going to be important contributors, but both of the contribution will come from U.S. patients at least that\u2019s our expectation today."

            "Hi. Thank you. Just one question on X-ALD, first off, congrats on the heading towards the clinic with that program. I\u2019m curious about the mechanism actually is VK0214 and how much we know about that, because you\u2019ve highlighted obviously the effect on very long chain fatty acids. My understanding is in this disease, macrophage activation is a key driver of pathology as well and particularly for the cerebral phenotype and thyroid hormone signaling may influence macrophages -- is there macrophages function on. I guess I\u2019m just wondering in addition to looking at the very long chain fatty acids, which you\u2019ve shown a few times and they improve, if you\u2019ve also looked at the influence of the drug on immune cell response.

And that transporter is known to serve as a transport for very long chain fatty acids brings them into the process on where they\u2019re metabolized and discarded.",
            "And what it does is it sort of fills the gap that\u2019s left by non-functional ABCD1. All of these patients suffer from mutations in the gene for ABCD1, which renders that transporter non-functional. And so regulating ABCD2, which we\u2019ve shown in fibroblasts from patients, should result in a reduction in very long chain fatty acids and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in the in vivo models.",
            "We haven\u2019t looked at the inflammatory signaling effects. I think the way we look at it -- this is an important question, the way we look at it is that the initial target here will likely be the AMN subsets of the population. And if we can show a benefit there, then we would really consider expanding into the cerebral cases, but the initial focus more on the adult side."

And once your cohort or two into that study if things look clean safety-wise, you then begin the multiple-ascending dose portion at the lowest dose that the single ascending dose started.",
            "And so the single ascending obviously is one dose, multiple-ascending dose study would be 14-day study. And when we have some read on what the data look like there we will then select the doses for the second portion of the study, which will target patients with AMN. And those patients will come in later because we\u2019ve got to get through the 14-day portion with a few cohorts first."

So it looks -- it\u2019s just got a different profile together on the PD side.",

When we looked at the early data for X-ALD, VK0214 just seemed to perform better than VK2809 in the ABCD1 knockout model, which is that, a common model for X-ALD. So it seemed to make more sense there and we had VK2809 already in full speed for NASH. So that\u2019s what led to the decision to pursue X-ALD."
