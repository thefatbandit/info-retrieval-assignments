         "Thank you, Jeremy. So let\u2019s talk about Belgium and our Woluwe shopping center. Well, the last 6 months of 2019 were strong, with retail sales up 4%, and we also got off to a good start to 2020 with our retailers continuing on an upward sales until February. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic abruptly ended the positive tenancy when it struck in early March. From the 18th of March, almost all our shops were forced to close, except our Maje supermarket, the pharmacy and one or two small grocery stores. On the 11th of May, the vast majority of them were able to reopen with the exception of bars and restaurants, which were only able to do so from the 8th of June.",
         "Post lockdown restrictions imposed by the authorities have been relatively strict in Belgium. In addition to the obligation of a one-way traffic inside the mall and customer having to wear a mask, only one shopper was allowed for a maximum of 30 minutes, this restriction was only relaxed last week with two shoppers now allowed without any time restriction. We sense that a significant element of our usual clientele extended their summer breaks and delaying returning to Brussels due to teleworking measures imposed by both European institution and also many corporates.",
         "The postponement of the sales period to August instead of July has probably not helped an already disoriented customer either. Notwithstanding these headwinds, we are now witnessing steady improvement in visitor numbers since the full reopening of our center, with August looking much better than the preceding months. After an immediate reduction of 90% in April, digital numbers were at 68% in June and have now increased to over 90% in August.",
         "A similar trend is observed also for turnover. So what about the rent? Generally speaking, to help our tenant get through the COVID crisis, we offered most of them a 50% rent reduction during the lockdown period, increased to 100% rent-free for food and beverage operator. We have now finalized negotiation with 96% of our tenants, and this concession represented a total amount of \u20ac2.8 million or 11% of our annual rent.",
         "In terms of rent collection, 92% of the negotiated rent for Q2 has now been cashed and over 93% of the rent for the month of July. Back on the merchandising front now. Notwithstanding COVID, we have continued to attract new brands, as highlighted by the recent openings of Courir and Maje, respectively, in May and June. And since July, we have agreed term with no less than four new tenants, and we have also completed in August the lease renewal of Fnac Darty Groupe subsidiary, Vanden Borre.",
         "Further new deals are expected to come in the coming months as tenant demand continues to hold up. And this tenant demand bodes well for our mixed-use and committed extension project. Our planning application was declared complete by Brussels region on the 25th of March. The first stage of the instruction process started this June. And given some delays related to COVID, we now expect to obtain our final building permit within the first half of 2022.",
         "And with that, I will hand over to Pascal for France."

      "Evert Jan van Garderen": [
         "Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everybody. In this conference call, I would like to say a few words about the accounting for the granted rent concessions, the key financial figures and the funding of the company. The granted rent concessions in our four markets have been accounted for under IFRS. And therefore, we had to account for the rent concessions in Sweden as a reduction of the rental income for an amount of \u20ac2 million in the second quarter of this calendar year. This was due to the Swedish government rent supportive initiative, which resulted in a rebate of half the discounts granted. Swedish peer companies reported in the same way as these concessions are not considered lease modifications as referred to in IFRS 16.",
         "In the case of Belgium, France and Italy, the granted rent concessions are considered as lease modifications, which implies that the amounts granted will be amortized over the remaining terms of the leases or until the first tenant break option. The total amount to be amortized as from the July 1, 2020 is at the moment \u20ac19.7 million. And this amortization will result in a lower rental income for the next financial reporting periods.",
         "On the basis of our lease administration systems, we\u2019ve calculated that the amount in the next six months until the 31st of December will be \u20ac6.8 million and that the expected remaining amounts for 2021 and 2022 will be \u20ac5.9 million and \u20ac2.8 million, respectively. And for 2023 and onwards, the remaining amounts to amortize annually will not be really material. As a consequence of this way of accounting, the cash flow from rents will be higher than the reported rental income, but we\u2019re pleased to see that this effect will diminish rapidly in the next two years with some residual effect for 2023 and the years thereafter.",
         "The direct investment result per depository receipt was \u20ac2.41, just \u20ac0.01 lower than the result for the previous year being \u20ac2.42, despite the rent concessions granted. The reason for this is that IFRS 16 is applicable to the largest part of these rent concessions amount. But it also implies that for the next six months until 31st December, the impact will be approximately \u20ac0.14 on the direct investment result per depository receipt. In case all rent concessions could have been charged to the second quarter of this calendar year, the direct investment result per depository receipt would have only been \u20ac2.01, so \u20ac0.40 lower.",
         "In the second quarter of 2020, we extended two long-term loans, which were to mature in July with principal amounts of \u20ac50 million for a loan in Italy and SEK 500 million, which is \u20ac45 million, for a loan in Sweden. The loan in Italy is now expiring in July 2021, and we have agreed with the Swedish bank to enter into negotiations in the next month to prolong the loan for three to five years. The maturity profile of the loan book is very sound, as presented on Slide 19 of the presentation, with only three long-term loans maturing in July 2022 for a total amount of \u20ac110 million.",
         "In July, we entered into two loans guaranteed by the Italian state for a total amount of \u20ac24 million and a term of three years. And the terms and conditions agreed are similar to those four transactions completed in the recent past. Currently, the average term of the loan portfolio is nearly five years, and the interest costs are hedged for 75% at the end of June for an average term of almost seven years, mostly by interest rate swaps, but also by a number of fixed interest coupon loans. The average interest rate for the loan book is now 2%.",
         "The adjusted net equity stood at \u20ac2.1 billion at the end of June, \u20ac50 million lower than at the end of December. The net loan to property value ratio increased to 45.5% from 44% reported at the end of December. And this calculation is made on a proportional consolidated basis, which we think is the most fair calculation. However, we note that there are also other loan-to-value ratio calculations, which we also show on the Slide 20 as well and would obviously lead to lower ratios.",
         "Finally, I would like to conclude that we have a robust balance sheet with headroom against our loan-to-value ratio covenant agreed with all our banks, which stands at 60%, which is a percentage in line with market practice.",
         "And that concludes my brief observations. And now I would like to hand over to the operator to invite participants in the conference call to ask questions."

      "Jeremy Lewis": [
         "Right. Thank God, I demuted myself just in time. As you\u2019re probably aware, I\u2019m heading rapidly to the end of my career. And it\u2019s probably suitable that it probably should have been \u2013 it has been the most difficult six months of the 30 years I\u2019ve been with Eurocommercial for everyone. It really has been tough. But I think the performance of our teams have been fantastic, I have to say. To retain our tiny vacancies just over 1%, to still see rental growth after the lockdown period is very, very encouraging. And I can\u2019t praise my colleagues highly enough. So the important thing is, when I go, the company is in very, very good hands.",
         "The decision we made during the lockdown was to hit it hard and hit it head-on and get as much out of the way as possible, to continue our good relations with our tenants that we\u2019ve always had. As you know, our OCRs are well-known for being low, and that\u2019s still \u2013 that\u2019s in good stead. The vacancies \u2013 valuations of our company, but I\u2019ve got to say one thing because there are still, I\u2019m afraid, some talk about what happens in the U.S. and the UK will naturally happen in Europe. That is complete and utter non-sense, I\u2019m afraid.",
         "The circumstances of shopping centers are completely different in all countries. In the U.S. supermarkets, there aren\u2019t any hards months, very few of them, are all in the strip centers, as they call them, strip malls. None of them aging malls have anything but the fading department stores. But of course, the most important difference is in the U.S., the retail density, i.e., the amount of square meters per capital is at least five and probably more times the amount in our markets.",
         "So as the UK is concerned, as you know, people who have born with me for a long time, I\u2019ve been talking for about 20 years that the UK rents are far too high, and in particular, business rents are far too high. So it\u2019s natural there have been many retailer failures. The other thing that people keep forgetting when they see the increase in use of the Internet, which has been significant, is that the average high street in the UK, the shops close at 5 or best 5:30. So nobody can do any shopping afterwards. And naturally, they will tend to use the Internet. And of course, the same applies as in the U.S. is that shopping centers or malls as they reluctantly call, they are often in town, of course, have very, very few supermarkets. Again, there are a lot many hypermarkets in the UK.",
         "So they haven\u2019t had the benefits that we\u2019ve had in all our countries of having major food stores where people can come every day if they want. Obviously, deliveries have increased a bit, but you should remember that for every delivery that a supermarket makes, they probably lose money. And if you charge GBP5 for a delivery, just think how long it takes one person to go and to collect the goods, you soon realize with a minimum wage of GBP9 that is not economic. We\u2019ve seen no evidence at all over the last five years, since people have been saying this, nor do we expect any in the future of what\u2019s happened in those two markets spreading to our markets. And I think the evidence is there was \u2013 rents are still falling in both those markets.",
         "Actually since the lockdown, the negotiations we\u2019ve done under the direction of Valeria with our superb leasing teams, we are actually getting pretty darn good growth still and, in some cases, during August up to 14% rental growth. So obviously, everybody is concerned about further lockdowns and all this. That\u2019s out of our hands. All I can say is that we have maintained our good relationship with our tenants. Our vacancies remain low, and there is still rental growth. I think they are the important things. And indeed, the turnover levels are around 90% already of 2019 levels.",
         "Valuations. And again, we\u2019re seeing massive devaluations in the UK and the U.S. We are not seeing them in our markets. And I think where there are similarities in Klepierre might be a good example of \u2013 obviously that are similar to ours. We\u2019re around 3% on average. Clearly, the best market for us, which is now 23% of our portfolio, is Sweden, where the valuation drops were almost non-existent, 0.5%. And again, people may \u2013 or some people have said, well, it\u2019s different in Europe. It isn\u2019t. The valuation firms are exactly the same firms that are doing the valuations in the UK. I\u2019m sure they all have one single insurance policy. So they all have to be careful.",
         "So the markets are different. There is no doubt of that at all. So please, will people stop saying the disease of England will spread to Europe. It has not, and people have been saying that five years, and it will not, in my view. We can argue that, of course. So anyway, valuations down a bit, which is more or less what we expected.",
         "Looking forward to December \u2013 and I\u2019m going to make a brave comment here, but perhaps I won\u2019t be around to be punished for it. And that is if, and it\u2019s a big if, of course, if economic circumstances and, of course, the wretched COVID is no worse than it is today, and interest rates has \u2013 indeed the Fed has announced, and I expect ECB to do the same, the interest rates are going to be low for many years, then I don\u2019t expect values in our portfolios to go down significantly at all in December. If anything, I expect they may stay the same.",
         "There are some deals on the go. And I suppose I should talk because everybody \u2013 I saw many people are talking about rights issues. We have no plans for a rights issue at all at the moment. We are, however, continuing with our sales program. There were two deals that have been agreed in principle with buyers before the COVID struck, which are still agreed in principle. But again, we\u2019re not going to make any announcement until the actual contracts are signed. But we have no reason to believe that they won\u2019t be, but who knows. So we\u2019re not going to say anything at all. They amount to about \u20ac70 million.",
         "We\u2019ve also got other properties earmarked for sale that, obviously, will be held back until after the COVID. And I suppose Les Atlantes as far as France is concerned, that we will be putting on the market subject to, of course, circumstances, about another \u20ac150 million it\u2019s worth. So assuming those deals go ahead and so far we\u2019ve never sold in the history of the company a property ever significantly below valuation, which supports them, so that is our plan for the moment for further sales. There\u2019s, of course, nothing wrong with the properties, but we are conscious of gearing levels and the concerns that the market has.",
         "A general comment about the famous word, dividend. If the circumstances that we face today with the rental levels we face today and the encouragement that we\u2019re getting from our vacancies and from the rental uplifts, particularly in Italy, I would have to say, then we could pay a dividend, an interim one even. We will not make that decision though until around the time of the EGM because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. So we will be cautious as we always have been. Clearly, we would like to pay dividends as soon as it is safe to do so. And of course, as some people have pointed out, we have an obligation under the FBI rules in the Netherlands to make a dividend. But remember, that dividend could be cash, shares or a combination of the 2.",
         "So if we go on to visitor numbers, yes, I mean, they\u2019re about at 83% now of what they were. In terms of retail sales growth, we\u2019ve talked about averaging 90%, which I think is pretty darn good over the same period last year. The important thing, I think, though, is not so much what\u2019s happening in rental uplifts during the COVID, but after. We\u2019ve got \u2013 by the end of August, 80 leases have been updated since the 1st of July. And the average uplift there is not 9% as it was previously but 13%. So actually, in a funny way, things are getting better. God knows whether it will last, but we\u2019ll see. So there we are. If that remains the case, then, as I say, I don\u2019t expect any significant change in values in December, but who knows.",
         "Occupancy levels, I\u2019ve talked about interesting facts, though. I think that the vast majority of our centers are the previously despised, boring hypermarket-based suburban centers. But they are now coming to their own, because, clearly, with our large free car parks, that easy accessibility to where people live in the suburbs. And the hypermarket operators are not stupid. They put the hypermarkets where the people are. The car journeys are easy and especially in France, the road systems are such that they\u2019re very easy to get to. So clearly, people are frightened to actually hold on the public transport at the moment. And so I think we can expect that the use of our shopping centers, such as they are, and especially in Sweden one \u2013 I mean all markets in effect.",
         "But what are they in Brussels is a sort of semi suburban, I suppose. And we\u2019ve always been very proud of its wonderful connections with the Metro, with the trams and the buses, and maybe it suffered a bit from that. We\u2019ll see because that valuation was slightly lower than the others, down 4%, not 3%, but only slightly. I think the other thing we\u2019ve got to consider is that the Internet and purchases on the Internet as opposed to physical shops have been around for 10 years or something now. So yes, of course, there was an increase in the lockdown period, as you would expect, but as I say, people are coming back to our centers now.",
         "So there was no fundamental change for use of the Internet for retailers. There was an increase, but that was a relative thing. And I think we\u2019ll see probably some continued slight increase, but I don\u2019t expect it to be fundamental, especially for our kind of centers. There\u2019s a contrast, though, and I think people better start thinking about that with the really fundamental change of the use of home working or teleworking or video conferencing and all the rest group, which, again, to avoid public transport going to city centers is becoming stronger. That is a step change. Now how long it last? God knows, but it is a pretty fundamental change because companies, including ours, and I have to say, I find it actually a bit harder to work than going to the office. Nonetheless, we have coped, as you can see from our results, pretty darn well.",
         "So we haven\u2019t laid anybody off. We don\u2019t intend to lay anybody off. As you know, we\u2019ve got a very low ratio of people per million of income or assets, but they are very, very good people. So the negotiations, yes, most of them are completed because we started early, before the COVID-19 negotiations, and rent collections are coming in pretty well. France has been a bit slower than anywhere else, I\u2019m sad to say, but Pascal can defend his country, I\u2019m sure, very well. And that is because the government, well meaning, appointed Madam Prost, who was badly named because she was not nearly as rapid as her compatriot, the racing driver.",
         "But what happened was she was appointed as the m\u00e9diatrice or I called her m\u00e9diatrice. That was probably a bit unfair. And that was supposed to get everybody together and sort things out, but it just didn\u2019t work. And I think the Fastighets\u00e4garna, the Retailers\u2019 Association took a fairly firm stand. But on the evidence we see now, we expect those things to be sorted out. [Indiscernible] As always in France, [indiscernible] as faith would there, so nothing at all happened during all this, as you would expect, but no, I think we will see that sorted out.",
         "There has been talk about everybody going to turnover rents. Well, of course, that\u2019s a complete surprise with the UK. That\u2019s never happened in the past, apart from one or two of the better companies. But clearly, turnover \u2013 proportion of turnover rents have been around for 50 years in \u2013 especially in the U.S. and, of course, as you know, the many years I spent in Australia. But certainly, in our company for 30 years, we\u2019ve always had on all the retail tenants, a proportion of the rent, if you like, a topper, payable on the basis of a percentage of turnover if that works out to be higher than the base rent. So we\u2019re very used to it. They\u2019re not in the UK and they\u2019re now grappling with those changes.",
         "We don\u2019t have any CVAs on at the moment. We\u2019ve got very few tenants in administration. And indeed, a couple of the major retail chains, Camaieu, et cetera, have all found buyers. And I think some of them are probably going to reduce the number of shops. I won\u2019t go into details. Pascal can do that. But we\u2019re not expecting any increase in vacancies coming up as a result of those purchases of those companies that went into administration. So I think, again, the situation is completely different in the UK.",
         "So there we are. That\u2019s a very overall comment. I\u2019ve probably forgotten dozens of things. But I think we\u2019ve done pretty well, I think, in the circumstances. When I say we, I mean everyone else, of course. I wish I could travel more, but some \u2013 given my age, I\u2019m supposed to be vulnerable. I don\u2019t feel very vulnerable, but \u2013 so I\u2019m not getting around as much as I should. But I can do no more than congratulate sincerely the work that everybody has done. So that, talking of the workers, Pascal, I\u2019m sorry, Benjamin. Just a word about Benjamin who now is the Asset Manager for Belgium. He was translated from Paris, flown into Brussels, and I think has done a remarkable job up there.",
         "So with that sort of fanfare, don\u2019t let me down, Benjamin, would you like to talk about Brussels?"

         "Good morning, and welcome to our 12 Months Interim Results Call. Our speakers today are Mr. Lewis, our CEO; Mr. van Garderen, our CFO; our four country Directors, Mr. Le Goueff, Mr. Frois, Mr. Fraticelli and Mr. Mills. In addition, our Group Leasing Director, Valeria Di Nisio; our Research Manager, Ilaria Vitaloni; and our Group Economist, Caterina Liori, are available to answer your questions at the end. Mr. Lewis, you can go ahead."
      ],
      "Pascal Le Goueff": [
         "Thank you, Benjamin, and good morning, everyone. So as Belgium, France had a very strict confinement, which had a serious negative effect on the economy. From the 15th of March, the government decided to close all the non-essential retails, including cinema, bars, restaurants. Population has been asked to stay home and was allowed to go out only with a certificate. So food stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets, telephone shops were allowed trade but with stringent restrictions in terms of space occupancy.",
         "Nevertheless, the recovery has been better-than-expected in our centers since the 11th of May, the starting date of the confinement. Digital numbers have steadily increased to end up with 82% of last year level in June, outperforming the CNCC index, which has released 78%. CNCC index is the shopping center organization in France. In July, visitor numbers continue to improve with 84% of last year level, in line with the CNCC index.",
         "Looking at tenant sales, we had a steady progression in May. And for the month of June, tenant sales recovered to more than 95% of the same period in 2019. And again, we outperformed the CNCC index, which has released 83.6%. In July, turnover continued to improve and show an increase of plus 1% compared to July 2019. So our star performance in France were Chasse Sud with 15.5%. Chasse Sud is south of suburb of Lyon, Val Thoiry in the suburb of Geneva with plus 6.4% and MoDo in Paris north suburbs with plus 5.1%.",
         "These positive figures show clearly that our typical suburban centers, retail park incurred by an hypermarket with good road access, free parking, good visibility are, in general, resilient, but in this period extremely resilient. We had also positive results in Bordeaux, Les Grands Hommes where we convince our tenants to open their store on the street and where Regus has opened last Wednesday, two days ago, their premium concept called Signature on the totality of the first floor. The rent has been multiplied by three on that floor.",
         "Regarding the leases agreement. As Jeremy said, we are in France behind our colleagues in Sweden and Belgium and Italy, with 52% amendments agreed. We have been delayed in our negotiation by the strong position of the largest tenants, the largest retailers who had experienced difficult time last December and last January due to the movement against the pension reform. But we have also been delayed by, as Jeremy said, again, the m\u00e9diatrice, Mrs. Prost, named by the government. And we failed to settle an agreement between landlords and retailers on the venue during the lockdown period. But we are very confident to find an agreement with the tenant from Les Atlantes.",
         "But even with this 52% agreement, the rents are paid in July. Our rent collection seen casting more than 85% of the rent in July, and we are not expecting major default of payment for the third quarter. One of the reasons of this encouraging number is certainly due to the mobilization and reactivity of our center managers who have implemented health and safety measures in all our centers from the beginning of the lockdown. And just when the lockdown started, the shops were closed, but the malls were opened to give access to the hypermarket. It has been a key element to reassure customers and employees and restore confidence, which is absolutely essential in our business.",
         "Regarding re-letting and renewals, we have produced plus 3% total growth from the 37 deals we made. If we look only at renewals, we renewed 19 leases at an average uplift of 9.5%. Several deals have been initiated or signed during the second quarter of 2020. In restaurants will replace a fashion retailer and we will multiply the rent by four. In Les Portes de Taverny, an independent shoes retailers will replace the pharmacy, which has been transferred on the bigger unit in the center. In MoDo we have agreed terms with a medical center to let a vacant unit. And in Les Atlantes, a lease has been signed with open [indiscernible] on 1,200 square meter.",
         "So in terms of vacancy, we have maintained our vacancy level at a low level, with 11 units out of 509 units. It\u2019s similar level than six months ago, where we had 12 vacant units in last December. And we are not expecting any significant increase of the vacancy level in France due to the demands of the retailers. ",
         "Finally, a word about our project in Etrembieres, this project has been delayed due to the lockdown. But this project is entirely pre-let to the group, Agapes, a restaurant operator, which will install two brands, Les Trois Brasseurs and Il Ristorante, on 1,600 square meter. Authorization has been granted and construction works will start in the coming months, and we expect completion in spring 2022.",
         "On that note, I hand over to Roberto."
      ],
      "Peter Mills": [
         "Thank you, Roberto. Well, the COVID period in Sweden began on 12th of March with the announcement of the first restrictions on public gatherings together with guidelines on social distancing, recommendations to work from home, avoiding the use of public transport. And the effect on the shopping centers was immediate. And in the following weeks, visitor numbers were reduced to around 70% of previous levels.",
         "However, in contrast to our other markets, the Swedish government were motivated on keeping the economy going, which included keeping all shopping centers fully opened and trading throughout. Our seven provincial shopping centers certainly benefited from their dominant market position in their regions, but also from their very strong provision of daily goods, particularly our hypermarkets, the ICA, Coops, City Gross and Systembolaget, the state alcohol monopoly, which helped maintain footfall levels throughout.",
         "While these everyday goods, representing around 20% of our rental income, paid in full as normal, many of our other retailers contacted us towards the end of March as their Q2 rental payments became due. The situation was helped by the constructive arrangements agreed between the landlords and retailers associations and the government, which resulted in the support initiative \u2013 rent support initiative covering Q2 rent only, and provided that if a landlord offered a qualifying tenant a rent discount of up to 50%, then within certain parameters, the government would refund the landlord half the discount.",
         "Our leasing team acted early and decisively within this framework, which resulted in a relatively small total net rent concession of around \u20ac2 million and the collection of 95% of the rent due for Q2. Footfall and retail sales have recovered steadily. So that by the end of July, visitor numbers had reached comparable levels to July last year, while retail sales have actually increased and by the end of July were 3.1% up on a like-for-like basis, with the majority of retail sectors now showing positive growth, including hypermarkets at 9%; home goods, plus 11%; sport, plus 9%; electricals plus 17%; books and toys, plus 27%; and guest and jewelry, plus 7%. Even fashion and restaurants, which initially suffered badly, are now recovering well and were only down 12% and 7%, respectively, by the end of July.",
         "So assisted by this positive recovery in sales, Q3 rent collection has been a normal standard routine, although tenants have been offered the opportunity to pay monthly in advance instead of quarterly, which, in fact, they have a right to do under Swedish law. So our July recovery is, therefore, 96% of rents due without any significant concessions, and we would now expect to maintain these high rent collection rates going forward.",
         "The Swedish leasing team have been active throughout the last 12 months, completing 75 lease renewals and re-lettings, producing an average uplift in rent of around 5%. The success of earlier project pre-letting means that the very small outstanding amounts of committed CapEx is mainly linked to finishing the construction of several large new retail units, which will be delivered to the tenant this autumn and will all be immediately income producing.",
         "The most significant of these are the 8,200 square meter Ecco Haarlem store at [indiscernible] let on a 10-year lease, and two further large H&M stores at Valbo and Elins Esplanad, where we are also adding new units of over 1,000 square meters for New York and Nordic Wellness. Once the new H&M stores are open, we will have delivered five new full concept H&M stores, including H&M Home over the last two years. The COVID crisis has definitely accelerated the trend for larger retail groups to rationalize their store portfolio, concentrating on a smaller number of profitable units in prime locations.",
         "H&M are the most important of several examples. And indeed, since opening their new and large stores in our shopping centers outside Kristianstad and Halmstad, they have already this year closed their old city center locations. Finally, a brief word on the investment market, where the volume of retail investment transactions has been relatively subdued, although there has been one important shopping center transaction completed during the COVID period, with the sale of Farsta Centrum to a joint venture between Alecta and the Finnish pension fund, Keva, at a price of around SEK 4 billion and at a net initial yield estimated to be just under 5%.",
         "Farsta is leasehold and had it been freehold our valuers estimate the yield would have been some 15 to 20 basis points lower. There have also been several transactions on stand-alone supermarkets and hypermarkets at historically low yields of under 5%, and there remains good investor appetite for retail parks, led to tenants into discount, DIY, sports household and electrical sectors who have all performed outstandingly well during the COVID period.",

         "Thanks, Pascal. Hi, everybody. Just continued on COVID-19, of course, the lockdown in Italy was strict and long, and that especially feared the young children at home. Most shops had to close from mid-March, let\u2019s say, to mid-May, and the economy was actually brought to a virtual standstill with a significant impact on most businesses. So that\u2019s also encouraging that the Italian government took several steps, and it\u2019s still taking several steps. So there were important economic measures, which were perhaps to help the economy rebound.",
         "Among these three are more important to mention for our sectors. One is the famous Cassa Integrazione furlough, which is applicable to most companies until the year-end. Then there are tax reductions and also a tax credit up to a maximum of 60% of the rent paid on the three-month period related to the lockdown. So let\u2019s see. If we look at visitors and turnover numbers, I mean, the visitor numbers are encouraging as they are currently around 80% of the pre-COVID figures. And that\u2019s really a good result, especially if you consider the circumstances which we have now, where you have no events that can be organized and for related to entertainment and food is limited.",
         "If we look at turnovers, they were 82% in June compared to June 2019, with a significant increase, of course, over the previous period, which was still affected by the lockdown measures. July figures are very similar, notwithstanding the fact that this year\u2019s sales will take place in August and not in July. So that\u2019s also an interesting point to see in August what will happen.",
         "If you look at our negotiations with tenants, as you know, we entered into negotiations with our tenants pretty soon and really have to thank our teams, leasing, asset, rent recollection and administration, which is often forgotten but they\u2019ve done a fantastic job. They\u2019ve been working incredibly hard, and they reached agreements over 88% by MGR of our tenants. And if we look at rent collection, in H1, we already collected 85% of the invoiced rent, which is 72% for Q2. July figures are at 97% as most tenants have been offered the possibility of paying monthly in advance instead of quarterly in advance, and that\u2019s until the end of the year.",
         "Occupancy is still at 99.2%. I think that shows a bit the resilience of our portfolio. If we then take-on, on the leasing activity, which Jeremy, of course, also mentioned and Pascal. And the 85 re-lettings and renewals over the past 12 months reduced an average uplift in rent of 14%. And of course, the leasing activity was comprehensively slow during the lockdown, but the situation remarkably improved in the past few weeks, especially since the beginning of July, when we signed 40 new leases achieving double-digit rental uplift. So we think it\u2019s a very good point because when you talk about the average we always think those are agreements which have been made pre-COVID, but that\u2019s not the case.",
         "Last but not least, I Gigli. We opened the new tariffs at the end of July. That helped Mercato Centrale, which is our food court add much more needed extra space, especially important if you consider the COVID-19 restrictions. The works for the restructuring of the old market and the toy shop into 14 units are progressing well with opening expected through Christmas. And we are leasing at good tenants like Nike, Adidas, okay. We\u2019re in discussion with JD Sports. So plenty of good news to come.",

            "If turnover levels stay roughly where they are, which so far, I mean, you could say, obviously, as some of these turnover levels reflect the fact there\u2019s sort of pent-up demand but leave that aside. But all I would say, if the \u2013 this is turnover levels. It\u2019s not footfall. It\u2019s turnover that matters. The amount of money they make, not the amount of our payment that\u2019s worn out.",
            "And I know people talk about footfall in the U.K. because most of the shops don\u2019t actually have a turnover clause. But no, I would say if \u2013 and Valeria can comment, I\u2019m sure, in a second because she\u2019s at the shop end. But I would say that if tenants really thought they were going to lose profitability, they would have told us. They\u2019ve had the opportunity to do so. So yes, of course, what the tenants will do very sensibly is where the shops are not profitable, they will close them as they always have and they always will. Nobody knows how deep the recession is going to be, and there is bound to be a recession if not this year, then next year.",
            "We don\u2019t know how deep that\u2019s going to be. All I can say is what happened in 2008 when there were disasters elsewhere. But in our markets, we managed to sell-through with the same vacancy levels we\u2019ve always had. And I don\u2019t expect it to be fairly different this time because governments are obviously very keen to try and minimize the recession. But of course, if turnovers generally drop significantly, then tenants are going to tell us, as they always have and always will.",
            "So \u2013 but so far, so good is all I can say. Please, it\u2019s totally different from the situation in the U.K. It really is. I mean, I talked earlier about turnover rent. I think there are four of our 1,200 tenants or something \u2013 I mean, 1,800 tenants. Four who just pay turnover rent, and they are obviously good old H&M, who was a prime moves of this and some, but not all of Inditex. But we\u2019ll see. So very fewer just as cleanly turnover. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. But for the moment, we\u2019re reasonably confident."

All I can say is looking at the deals that we believe we are doing, and I repeat that we\u2019re not going to announce anything until it\u2019s a signed contract, even though there is in principle agreement in writing. But those two transactions are very, very close to our valuation.",

So it\u2019s difficult to tell what\u2019s going to happen in France. But in terms of color, I mean, there\u2019s \u2013 I think we probably hinted 1 in France and 1 in Sweden there. The other ones, I\u2019d rather not comment, but they will not be all in my country is all I can say. But again, we have no even agreements, not even formally we have them on the market.

It\u2019s a municipal center. It is in the southern suburbs of Stockholm. But I think it\u2019s an isolated catchment and I think in many ways is directly comparable to \u2013 even though it\u2019s part of a bigger city comparable to our provincial centers, certainly our valuers thoughts.

So we said let\u2019s disclose it, but in a proper way, not telling one or two analysts, but put it in our press release in the market. So there we are and everybody knows now what it is."

And in fact, out of the total, as we said, 12% are yet to be finalized, which represent in numbers really only 115 units for about 60 tenants, brands, but are already ongoing. And in fact, I\u2019ve already booked meetings for next week because, finally, everybody is back onboard.",

Of these, bear in mind that 27% \u2013 almost 28% are brand-new tenants coming in our centers. And this is I\u2019m talking for most all countries. This is a clear sign that retailers have been waiting to come in our centers. Notwithstanding COVID, I\u2019ve been happy to pay a premium.

But the reason why we are very confident and we are nearly there in terms of agreements \u2013 to get agreements with our largest tenants under the top 20, the reason is the performance they had these last two months in terms of footfall and in terms of turnover. It was unexpected from us, but from the tenant as well. So we were minus 4.8% in June. We are positive in July. And according to the latest information in August, it should be not too bad for August.

Do you see any indication that, let\u2019s say, the banks are only willing to lend for a shorter period of time, let\u2019s say, if the average is now around five years?

Let\u2019s say, what I said also in my introduction is that we will \u2013 after this holiday period will enter into further negotiations with a Swedish bank, where we have a loan which was extended until the end of the year. And we definitely have as an intention to extend that one between three to five years. We have no signs that that\u2019s certainly more difficult also in terms of pricing. Our experience, of course, has been quite recent, okay, that\u2019s maybe slightly different situation.",

So, so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything that would suddenly, yes, make us nervous or that we say there is more difficulty out there. We still see a lot of support of the banks to their clients, of course, helped by central banks and also what governments are doing.

So in some cases, we went to buy some cloths, and they were not adequate because it still where sort of winter-ish, where you were looking for something more light. So that also contributed, let\u2019s say, to fashion selling less. And of course, as you know, Niko, the food has been especially hit because of the social distancing and the rest. So they, of course, are having more trouble coming back to the turnovers that they had because if you can lease out 1 table out of two, then that\u2019s, of course, a problem.",

They absolutely appreciated it because they can accommodate a lot of demand, which they couldn\u2019t accommodate previously, if that answers a bit your question.

But certainly, as far as it\u2019s gone, retail, I think we can be reasonably satisfied with the results so far. So there we are. So thank you all for your interest and your questions. Some of you we\u2019ll be seeing on road shows, again, I\u2019m sure, and I look forward to that. So again, thank you all very much for your interest."
