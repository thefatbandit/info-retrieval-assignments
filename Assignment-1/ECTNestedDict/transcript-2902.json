         "Thank you, Madison. Good morning, this is Dan O'Brien, CEO of Flexible Solutions. The Safe Harbor provision, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements. Certain of the statements contained herein, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements with respect to events, the occurrence of which involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements may be impacted either positively or negatively by various factors.",
         "Information concerning the potential factors that could affect the Company is detailed from time-to-time in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ",
         "Welcome to the 2020 Q2 call. Prior to addressing our financials, I would like to talk about our corporate condition and product lines, along with what in our opinion might occur over the next two quarters.",
         "COVID virus, the NanoChem subsidiary, the ENP subsidiary, and the Florida LLC investment are all engaged in producing for the agriculture and/or the cleaning products sectors. Therefore, we are considered essential services and likely to remain so if restrictions are reinstated. ",
         "Productions and sales are continuing to meet customer orders. We continue to shrink our inventory and increase our cash position in Q2 by ordering less inventory than we consumed. This tactic has been successful and we feel that we now have the right level of inventory to suit the risks of COVID, while still having the ability to service our customers. ",
         "Our NanoChem division, NCS represents more than one half the revenue of FSI. This division makes thermal polyaspartic acid, called TPA for short, a biodegradable polymer with many valuable uses. NCS also manufactures SUN 27 and N Savr 30, which are used to reduce nitrogen fertilizer loss from soil. ",
         "TPA is used in agriculture to significantly increase crop yield. The method of action is by slowing crystal growth between fertilizer ions and other ions in the soil, resulting in the fertilizer remaining available longer for the plants to use. TPA is also a biodegradable way of treating oilfield water to prevent pipes from plugging with mineral scale. ",
         "Our sales into this market are well established and normally grow steadily, but slowly. A simple explanation of TPA\u2019s effect is that it prevents the scaling out of minerals that are part of the water fraction of oil as it exits the rock formation. Scale must be prevented to keep the oil recovery pipes from clogging.",
         "SUN 27 and N Savr 30 are our nitrogen conservation products. Nitrogen is a critical fertilizer but it\u2019s subject to loss through bacterial breakdown, evaporation and soil runoff. SUN 27 is used to conserve nitrogen from attack by soil bacterial enzymes, while N Savr 30 is directed towards reducing nitrogen loss through leaching and evaporation. ",
         "ENP, the October 2018 acquisition, ENP is focused on sales into the greenhouse turf and golf markets, while our NCS sales are into row crop agriculture, two very distinct markets. The strong quarters for ENP are two and three to match the U.S. spring and summer. Q1 was stronger than the year earlier period and Q2 repeated the feat. ",
         "ENP expects moderate growth in the second half of 2020 with a caution that Q4 early buy orders could be affected if the virus causes customers to keep inventory very low. ",
         "The LLC investment announced in January 2019, this investment was profitable again. The company we invested in sold more in Q2 2020 than it did in Q2 2019. The company is focused on international sales into multiple countries, all of which are facing different COVID issues and responding in varied ways.",
         "The large number of variables prevents any useful prediction for second half 2020 other than results similar to 2019. Q3 and the rest of the year. TPA, SUN 27, and N Savr 30 for agriculture use had peak uptake in Q1 and Q2 with Q2 showing quite strongly. Early buy orders in Q4 could be reduced, if our customers decide to use just-in-time strategies.",
         "Oil, gas and industrial sales of TPA are expected to be flat or mildly down in Q3, compared to the previous year, while predictions regarding Q4 are not possible under the circumstances. Like agriculture, our sales to cleaning products and water treatment are considered essential, leaving only oil and gas as a market vertical at significant risk. ",
         "The risk in O&G is not permanent loss of business, rather it's a possibility of some wells shutting down for maintenance while oil prices are low.",
         "Tariffs. Since September 30 2018, many of our raw materials imported from China have included a 10% additional tariff, which rose to 25% in 2019. U.S. customers have received price increases from us as this inventory entered production. International customers have not been charged the tariffs, because we\u2019re applying for the export rebates available to recover the tariffs.",
         "As a result, the accumulating tariff payments to the government are affecting our cost of goods, our cash flow and our profits negatively until the rebates are received. Rebates are very complicated to apply for and take many months to arrive. The total dollar amount due back to us has become significant and continues to increase.",
         "The rebates will increase profitability and cash flow, while decreasing cost of goods in future orders during which the rebates are received. ",
         "In my last speech, I expressed comfort that we would begin to see rebates in Q2 or early in Q3. I based this on the fact that we filed our templates and requests for our first rebate in mid-May. As of August 14, there has been no response from the government except an excuse that employees are not in the office, because there is a 30 day payment delay even after approval, we no longer expect rebates in Q3. ",
         "Highlights of the financial results. Sales for the quarter increased 14% to $7.71 million, compared with $6.77 million in Q2 2019. The result is a gain of $1.3 million or $0.09 a share in the 2020 period, compared to a loss of $28,000 or $0.00 a share in 2019. ",
         "We attribute the improvement to A, increased sales; B, reduced expenses; C, better product mix; and D, no repeat of the bad debt recognized in Q2 2019. ",
         "Working capital is adequate for all our purposes and is increasing during 2020 as we book retained profits from sales. Effort will be made to minimize inventory and accounts receivable, while increasing cash until the effects of the virus become more predictable. We also have a line of credit with BMO Harris Bank in Chicago. We are confident that we can execute our plans with the existing capital.",
         "The purchase of ENP in 2019 was funded by a term loan from Harris Bank and a $1 million convertible debenture taken by the seller. One half of the debenture was converted to 200,000 FSI shares in 2019, while the remaining $500,000 was retired for cash in Q2. The term loan is approaching half repayment. ",
         "And finally, in this area of my speech, the LLC investment in January 2019 was made with cash on hand provided by FSL, our Canadian operating company. ",
         "The text of this speech will be available as an 8K filing on www.sec.gov later today, Monday, August 17, email or FAX copies can be requested from Jason Bloom at jason@flexiblesolutions.com. ",
         "Thank you. The floor is open for questions. And Madison, will you please give the instructions and set everything up for the Q&A?"

            "Hi, Bill, and good to hear from you. The Florida LLC had issues last year in Q1 and Q2 that were related to international currency specifically Brazil, I believe it\u2019s the Real. Those have not been repeated and the customers that were normally serviced, ordered on time and then volumes expected rather than playing games with running down inventory. ",
            "Definitely, the margins are likely to remain similar. They won\u2019t be increasing, but similar to down a little bit depending on our cost of goods which is of course, because we manufacture many of the products for the LLC. ",
            "Our cost of goods flows through to their cost of goods and to their margin, as well. So, I would say, as a decent prediction, we are tracking in a normal canyon right now. But I can\u2019t promise that something will kick us out. "

I don\u2019t want to disclose what the equipment is for, for fear of leading competitors to the same conclusion we have which is this equipment is going to be very profitable over time. But, it is nearly finished installation. ",
            "We expect it to go live by the end of the year and the CapEx will then be allowed to be expensed by the end of the year according to the Trump tax changes. So, yes, that\u2019s what we are up to. There is about another, my guess, maybe another $500,000 before we go live. "

            "So, just to kind of follow-up on your tariff comment. So, kind of wanted to confirm that, the amount that you guys are expecting roughly $0.5 million to $1 million, is that amount for quarter in terms of a reduction in total cost of goods, is that what you guys are still expecting? "

      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "No. Here is what has happened. Over the, almost two years, that these \u2013 that we\u2019ve been pursuing these rebates, the accumulated amount is between $500,000 and $1 million that we expect back. And that material or that amount of money is likely to come back across a one to two quarter period. Whenever it starts, those historic ones should come back across one to two quarters. ",
            "But let\u2019s also remember that every pound of raw material we are buying out of China continues to have a tariff applied. So, what we are trying to do here with the first set of rebates is get back into a situation where we don\u2019t have historical rebates due to us. We only have the last quarter or the last four months perhaps. ",
            "So we want to get into a position where instead of having a very large chunk of historical rebates due to us, we only have the three months \u2013 the most recent three months that we\u2019ve been paying. And we are frustrated, I can imagine the U.S. shareholders are frustrated and I imagine even the government is frustrated that they can\u2019t get organized enough to rubber stamp our application and let this go forward. ",
            "But that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. So, expect at some point to have one to two quarters where there is an extra $500 million \u2013 sorry, $500,000 to $1 million and then a normal period thereafter where we put out a couple of $100,000 in tariffs in one quarter but get the previous quarter\u2019s tariff rebates back. That make a lot of sense or not? "

            "I noticed in the WaterSavr kind of segment you guys kind of broke even in terms of profitability and you guys had \u2013 you guys have lost kind of a immaterial amount in previous quarters. But have actually shown profitability. Is that something you can kind of expect going forward? "

We have been left with a small sales into swimming pools and small sales into the oil and gas industry in North America who are using it to keep water in their fracking ponds. ",

            "So, I think what you can expect to see is similar results that where the revenue exceeds the cost of goods and the cost of keeping the divisions open is actually a value to us because it does support employees who have secondary responsibilities in accounting and other areas of our company. So it\u2019s going to be valuable. It\u2019s going to defray cost. But it\u2019s not going to be a focus going forward. "

So, this year has been much more favorable. ",

Because the planting seasons internationally are far different from North America and there is even a second planting season in the fall for South America for many of the acres. ",

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, as well as the bank, I think we all have to recognize that COVID has become more of a long-term problem than it was expected in February and March. And, all of us are waiting for a reliable vaccine or a guaranteed cure if you get it. So, - and I read two very instructive magazines weekly is Chemical Engineering News and The Economist. ",
            "My understanding is that we are at least a year away from a reliable vaccine applied to enough human beings that normalized operations across the world will take place. The FSI Board is feeling very strongly that that no resumption of a dividend should happen until that vaccine or let\u2019s be honest, maybe vaccine is never achieved, but a reliable cure for people who get sick is in place. ",
            "So, we are going to be quite conservative if the world hadn\u2019t changed back in February, we obviously would have had enough money and capacity to continue a dividend. But we would not want to be in a situation of paying out our cash and then discovering that for some reason or other our bank loans were no longer available and we didn\u2019t have the cash to repay them.

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Good. And it seems that your most M&A activity, the Florida LLC and that other company, ENP have done pretty well and they are good acquisitions. But could you just maybe give me a sense about, basically, the adoption of TPA and the nitrogen stabilizers, how is that occurring domestically worldwide? And what you need to do to speed that up through acquisitions or internal marketing efforts? "

      "31": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Well, yes. It\u2019s a good question. I like these ones. The adoption of nitrogen stabilizers in the North American market is about 20% to 25% of nitrogen fertilizer used right now and growing reasonably rapidly. So, we expect to earn our share in that market. Internationally, which was another reason why we made the Florida acquisition. ",
            "It\u2019s only 10% and certain countries are much greater than that. But certain countries are much less. So, internationally, there is an even bigger opportunity than there is in the United States. Nitrogen stabilizers aren\u2019t just about yield anymore. They are also about the amount of urea and other nitrogen products that end up in our groundwater and in our river systems. ",
            "If you really want to scare yourselves sometime, have a look at algae blooms in the Gulf of Mexico that are 45% due to nitrogen fertilizer runoff from the corn and soybean producing states. And then obviously we have to produce food, but we should be doing a better job of making sure that the fertilizers we need to produce the amount of food we want to eat or staying where we put them. ",
            "And so, over time, nitrogen stabilizers we expect them to be mandated. But waiting for government action is not our plan. ",
            "And I\u2019ll just move before talking about sales techniques, I\u2019ll move to the TPA project. TPA is less of a pollution solution and more of a yield enhancer. So, that one will take more sales effort and has taken more sales effort over the years. But it\u2019s a great product, great margins on it. And it works virtually for every farmer that tries it. So they are now backing up to the \u2013 is the first stage of your question, we will look to organic growth just over the next few quarters to make sure we understand exactly what we are doing. One of the reasons for the two very specific acquisitions after 15 years of doing nothing was people. Each of these acquisitions brought with us people we believe are part of the next phase of Flexible Solutions and its growth. We\u2019ve lowered our average age. We\u2019ve increased our average IQ. And we\u2019ve brought to our company, what I feel is an increased exuberance and optimism. So, we want to \u2013 we would love to acquire more companies, but it has to match a very harsh set of rules for us. One, it doesn\u2019t end up on my shoulders running the new group. I have enough on my shoulders. Two, it\u2019s accretive immediately. Three, it\u2019s reasonably priced. And four, it brings to our company people that can be part of the next generation, because, we don\u2019t want to make our job harder. We want to make it more fun. And if we find acquisitions that suit all of that, we will make them. If we can\u2019t find them, we will find ways to grow organically. Sorry about the long answer. "
