      "Gary Chapman": [
         "Thank you. Welcome, everybody.",
         "As always, the earnings release and slide presentation are both available through our website. KNOT Offshore Partners owns and operates shuttle tankers where our ships transport oil from offshore production units to shoreside and are an essential part of the supply chain for our customers, all of whom are large names in the oil and energy market.",
         "Our call today will include the non-U.S. GAAP measures of distributable cash flow and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation amortization, EBITDA. The earnings release includes a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. And please remember that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risks and uncertainties. These are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings. Actual events and results can differ materially from those forward-looking statements, and the Partnership does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements, and I refer you to slide 2 and our 2019 20-F for further details.",
         "Onto slide 3, Q2 2020 Financial Highlights and Recent Events.",
         "We continue to operate our fleet without any material disruption as a result of COVID-19, coronavirus, and you will find more information in our earnings release related to this topic.",
         "I think, it\u2019s worth saying that we\u2019re reporting this quarter one of the best sets of results of the Partnership. We generated total revenue of $70.3 million, operating income of $33.4 million and net income of $21.7 million, and more comparably quarter-by-quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $55.8 million. We ended with distributable cash flow generated of $30.7 million, giving a coverage ratio -- distribution coverage ratio at the end of the quarter of 1.70 times. And we again maintained our cash distribution of $0.52 per common unit, returning an annual yield of quite remarkably around 16%, based on a $13 unit price. During the quarter, the fleet operated with 99.7% utilization for scheduled operations. There were no drydocks this quarter and they were non-planned for the remainder of 2020. Shell, in the end, chose not to exercise their option on the Windsor Knutsen. And whilst the vessel is still with Shell today, we expect that it will be redelivered to the Partnership sometime between mid-September and mid-December 2020, in accordance with the redelivery provisions in the charter. The Partnership\u2019s currently looking at all options to recharter the vessel, and we\u2019re talking to a number of potential parties, including the sponsor.",
         "On slide 4, the Income Statement.",
         "For the second quarter of 2020, we recorded total revenues of $70.3 million compared to $67.2 million for the first quarter of 2020. The increase is almost entirely related to the effect of Raquel Knutsen\u2019s scheduled drydock in the first quarter.",
         "Vessel operating expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were $13.1 million, a decrease of $2.5 million over the first quarter of 2020. This decrease was mainly the net result of lower operating expenses across the fleet in the second quarter, and favorable movements in the Norwegian krone U.S. dollar exchange rate.",
         "Depreciation was essentially flat at $22.5 million for the second quarter compared to first quarter at $22.4 million. Similarly, admin and general expenses were $1.3 million, compared to $1.4 million in the first quarter. Overall, this caused operating income to rise to $33.4 million in the second quarter, compared to $28.4 million in the first quarter of 2020.",
         "Interest expense for quarter two was $8.5 million, a decrease of $2 million from $10.5 million in quarter one. The decrease again being driven by lower LIBOR on average across all credit facilities that are not hedged.",
         "Realized and unrealized losses on derivative instruments were $3.1 million in the second quarter, compared to a loss of $23.7 million in the first quarter. The unrealized non-cash element of the mark-to-market loss was $2.8 million for the second quarter of 2020, compared to a loss of $23.9 million for the first quarter of 2020. Of the unrealized loss for the second quarter of 2020, $3.5 million is related to a mark-to-market loss on interest rate swaps due to a decrease in the U.S. dollar rates and a gain of $0.7 million is related to foreign exchange contracts.",
         "Slide 5, Adjusted EBITDA.",
         "You\u2019ll see an incredibly consistent adjusted EBITDA on this slide. And again, in the second quarter, the Partnership generated adjusted EBITDA of $55.8 million, compared to $50.8 million in the first quarter. The difference again, arising mainly as a result of Raquel Knutsen\u2019s scheduled drydock in the first quarter.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow, referring to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and other financial items. And please do refer to the notes at the bottom of this slide.",
         "Slide 6, Distributable Cash Flow or DCF is another non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and another very consistent measure for the Partnership.",
         "DCF was $30.7 million in the second quarter in comparison to $24 million in the first quarter. And the distribution cover at end of quarter two, as stated, was 1.70. The increase over the first quarter relates to Raquel Knutsen scheduled drydocking in that first quarter, but also to our capital management of the business helped also by some favorable shifts in interest costs and exchange rates. In the quarter, we, again maintained our distribution level at $0.52 per unit, equivalent to an annual distribution of $2.08. And again, please do the refer to the notes at the bottom of the slide.",
         "Slide 7, on the Balance Sheet.",
         "At the end of the second quarter, the Partnership had $70.1 million in available liquidity, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $41.4 million and we still retain $28.7 million of capacity under our revolving credit facilities. The revolving credit facilities mature in August 2021 and September 2023. Otherwise, KNOP has no other refinancing falling due until the end of 2021. The Partnership\u2019s total interest-bearing debt outstanding as of June 30, 2020 was $960 million, down from $984 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020. And the average margin paid on the Partnership\u2019s outstanding debt this quarter again stayed as last quarter at approximately 2.1% over LIBOR.",
         "At the end of the second quarter, the Partnership had entered into various interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $627 million, down from $634 million at the end of last quarter to hedge against the interest rate risks of its variable rate borrowings. Based on this in this quarter, we received interest based on three or six-month LIBOR and paid a weighted average interest rate of 1.74% under the interest rate swap agreements, which have an average maturity of approximately 3.6 years. We don\u2019t apply hedge accounting, so our financial results are impacted by changes in the market value of these financial instruments. However, cash flow is stabilized by them, mitigating interest rate risk on distributable cash flow.",
         "Slide 8, an update on our long-term contracts.",
         "For the Windsor Knutsen, as stated at the outset, Shell in the end chose not to exercise their option of the Windsor Knutsen. And we expect that the vessel will be redelivered sometime between mid-September and mid-December 2020 in accordance with the flexible redelivery provisions in the charter. These redelivery provisions are typical and just allow the charterer to complete the charter at an appropriate operational time rather than say, mid-voyage. The Partnership is currently looking at all options to reach out to the vessel, and we\u2019re talking to a number of potential parties, including the sponsor, not just for operations in Brazil, but also for potential deployment elsewhere.",
         "Bodil Knutsen is our largest shuttle tanker operating in North Sea and is still on charter to Equinor until May, 2021. Equinor then have three further one year annual extension options.",
         "Torill Knutsen and Hilda Knutsen both operate on the Goliat Field in the Barents Sea. After initial five-year terms on both vessels, the Hilda time charter extended for 4 more year to 2022, and then has further options to extend the charter by 3 more one year periods until 2025. The charterer of Torill has taken two of its one year extension options to extend the time charter until November 2022 and then have further options to extend the charter by two more one-year periods until 2024.",
         "Dan Sabia, Dan Cisne, Fortaleza and Recife Knutsen remain on long-term bareboat charters through to 2023 with Petrobras Transpetro. Carmen Knutsen and Raquel Knutsen are on charter to Repsol Sinopec until 2023 and 2025, respectively, and with options to extend until 2026 and 2030, also respectively. The Ingrid Knutsen is on time charter until 2024 with V\u00e5r Energi, with charterer\u2019s options to extend by up to five more one-year periods.",
         "Tordis, Vigdis and Lena Knutsen are on five-year charters to Brazil Shipping, a subsidiary of Shell. These will expire in 2022, and the charterer has options to extend for up to a further 10 years on each vessel. The Brasil and Anna Knutsen are on charter to Galp Energia until 2022 with charterer\u2019s options to extend up to 2028.",
         "At June 30, 2020, the KNOP fleet had an average remaining fixed contract duration of 2.4 years and an additional 3.9 years on average in charterer\u2019s options, as you can see, all with strong credit counterparties.",
         "When the Partnership listed in 2013, charter renewals were a distant issue, but whilst they are now starting to materialize, it\u2019s important to repeat that these renewal decision points are a natural part of our business. And it\u2019s natural that our average remaining fixed contract duration period will come down. This is unfortunately highlighted more right now by the fact that the equity markets are currently not economically available to us to dropdown the growing list of new business that our sponsor has contracted as we have done successfully in the past.",
         "What works in our favor, however, is our customers\u2019 essential need for these assets as part of their supply chain, our market leading position, especially in Brazil, our sponsor\u2019s 30-plus-year history in this industry, the age of our fleet, the technological stability that we see in the industry right now and into the foreseeable future, plus our willingness and ability to be flexible for our customers\u2019 needs. Contracts in the shuttle tanker market are also still typically measured in years rather than days, weeks or months as compared to many other areas of shipping.",
         "We never give guarantees as to the future and in particular, the time charter rate for a charterers\u2019 option or a new charter can be open for a level of negotiation. But, we want to repeat our point that we believe the Partnership\u2019s risk profile is not the same as a typical shipping company.",
         "All of these factors continue to make the Partnership remain positive about the future of our business and we\u2019ve built up a strong distribution coverage ratio for these times of greater uncertainty.",
         "On slide 9, the sponsor, KNOT, now has seven vessels that could be dropped into the KNOP, beginning from around Q4 2020. These have an average fixed contract period of 5.6 years with an average of a further 8.1 years extension options. The acquisition by KNOP of any dropdown vessels in the future is subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of each of KNOP and the sponsor, KNOT, and there can be no assurance that any potential dropdowns will actually occur. ",
         "In reality, it is not possible for the Partnership to consider purchasing all of these vessels in today\u2019s market. And indeed, it it\u2019s too early for some in any case. However, we are exploring options as to how we might be able to purchase one or even two vessels from the sponsor, without issuing new common equity and without putting undue strain on the Partnership\u2019s liquidity.",
         "More specifically, we\u2019re currently looking at how we can achieve one dropdown in the fourth quarter of 2020, perhaps December. But, it remains uncertain at this time whether this will be possible. What is clear is that if the market does begin to change for the better, then the Partnership is well-positioned to grow.",
         "On slide 10. The next following slides are all taken from external sources which we feel give investors a slightly more independent view than simply presenting information solely prepared by management.",
         "This first slide provides some background information on the situation in Brazil, and we think demonstrates the resilience of the Brazilian market in 2020. And whilst we\u2019ve seen a dampening of output and growth, growth and economic development is still expected. All of this will have a knock-on effect for shuttle tankers and our commercial outlook. And whilst we\u2019re not contractually expressed to oil price, volume or storage risks in our charters, these are some of the kinds of reasons as to why the Partnership remains upbeat about the future.",
         "On slide 11, the purpose of this slide is to show the estimated oil production development in Brazil for shuttle tankers and how, despite some potential delays, the trajectory remains positive. Whilst we believe the number of barrels today shown here for 2021 and beyond are quite conservative, we do agree that the gradient of the red line was quite representative before April 2020, whereas the blue line today is perhaps what we expect across the coming five years. What we also believe is that, should the economic situation improve, then not only is Brazil well-placed to capitalize, we do not think it would take much of an improvement for the shuttle tanker market to fully tighten again. ",
         "Slide 12 shows similar data for the North Sea. And while the levels of growth are lower, we still expect this market to continue to grow over the next three to five years, and the demand for shuttle tankers to remain robust.",
         "On slide 13, this slide is perhaps best at showing why we feel there are strong mid to long-term prospects for shuttle tankers in the Brazilian market. Petrobras as still the dominant player in Brazil have been selling a whole host of shallow and onshore assets in 2020 and reaffirming their commitment to the deep and ultra-deep wells which have relatively low costs. We\u2019ve seen increasing FPSO activity and we\u2019re seeing more involvement of Chinese players in the Brazilian oil market, which opens up a new area of activity. And indeed, our sponsor now has its first shuttle tanker contract with PetroChina.",
         "We\u2019re not saying there aren\u2019t challenges in the short-term and equity markets with a softer economic climate and sentiment towards energy and shipping, but we see the mid to long-term growth. And as a business, and a leading and experienced business in this industry, we\u2019re doing all we can to ensure we navigate a stable path through the coming few quarters.",
         "Slide 14. So, in summary, we\u2019ve reported a very strong quarter with a continued stable operating performance at 99.7% utilization for scheduled operations. Distributable cash flow of $30.7 million with coverage of 1.7, giving the Partnership a degree of flexibility to manage potential short to mid-term headwinds. We maintained our quarterly distribution of $0.52 for the 20th consecutive quarter. Our operations have remained largely unaffected by coronavirus, and we\u2019ve been taking steps, like many companies to keep our staff and crew safe whilst working.",
         "We\u2019re not exposed to short-term market turbulence, such as short-term fluctuations in oil prices, volume of oil transported or global oil storage capacity. We\u2019re seriously considering financing options to take one new vessel from the sponsor without issuing new equity to strengthen cash flows and our contracted revenue stream, if we can. And whilst we acknowledge the uncertainties seen in the wider energy market and the higher degree of difficulty in accessing new equity, both of which may continue for some time, we believe the shuttle tanker market is resilient, and growth prospects remain strong over the mid to long-term, particularly in Brazil.",
         "That concludes my short presentation for today, and I\u2019ll open for any questions. Thank you."

            "Hi. Good morning. Gary, just wondering if you could help frame the recontracting on Windsor for us. And maybe more specifically, it sounds like there\u2019s a low likelihood where it goes unutilized in the short-term, just given the sponsor support. But maybe just if you could comment on the utilization outlook for the vessel and then also just around rate expectations or what would be an acceptable outcome for the Partnership?"

      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Hello, Marc. You\u2019re right. We are not considering the Windsor situation as pivotal to the Partnership\u2019s fortunes right now. Shipping and shipping requirements, as you all know, are constantly changing for all of our customers. And we said on prior earnings calls, whilst this re-chartering ambiguity is perhaps new for KNOP, it\u2019s not now for our sponsor who has been doing this quite successfully for over 30 years. So, we\u2019re leaving it to our chartering department right now, and we\u2019re waiting to hear, hey, what\u2019s next for the vessel? The vessel is a good vessel. It\u2019s approximately 12, 13 years old, and it\u2019s performed very well. It\u2019s high class. It\u2019s a very big shipping tanker. We don\u2019t consider it difficult to charge for it. But you\u2019re right, it depends on the rates. I think, we\u2019ve seen competition coming into the market with newbuild vessels and newbuild rates. But as we said before, for a newbuild vessel, charterers are asked to commit for a minimum five years, and often that\u2019s quite a commitment for most charterers. So, typically for a shorter term charter, we\u2019re able to ask for more than the bottom base rate newbuild price. And I think that\u2019s pretty much where we are with the Windsor at the moment. Its current rate isn\u2019t particularly high. We may end up taking a few thousands a day off it and in order to recharter it. But, as I said at the start of this answer, we\u2019re not really considering that to be a pivotal moment really for the Partnership."

            "Got it. Understood. And then, assuming if it were to move to a different geographical region, would there be any, like, I guess capital costs incurred associated with maybe retrofitting vessel to serve a specific customer? How should we think about that?"

         "Speaker": "Marc Solecitto"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Generally speaking, I don\u2019t think it will need anything. Obviously that does dependent. The vessel, you may recall, went on charter down to Africa a short time ago when we did the swap with shell and the sponsor. So, we know that it\u2019s perfectly capable of going down there. It\u2019s ice class. So, it can operate in the North Sea, no problem. And generally speaking, if a vessel needs specific equipment, then, that\u2019s the charterers cost."

            "Got it. Okay. And then, shifting gears to dropdown, you mentioned that the Partnership was considering one, as early as 4Q of this year. It sounds like -- or it sounded like, there\u2019s certain conditions that would have to be met on the Partnership\u2019s end to move forward with that. But, you also noted later on, I think that there might be way to finance that without going to the public equity markets. So, just wondering what conditions you\u2019re looking for, we should be looking for where we could expect to move forward with the dropdown."

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "We\u2019ve got two or three things on our table at the moment, which I won\u2019t go into in detail. But, it\u2019s largely internally funded. It may have an impact on leverage, but not too much. We\u2019re paying down our debt. We\u2019re overpaying on our debt. We\u2019re paying approximately $80 million a year on our debt repayment. So, coincidentally, roughly equal to our distribution. I think, what we\u2019re looking for is to make sure that we don\u2019t put undue stress on the rest of the whole partnership, and our business just in order to take a dropdown. We operate to payout and to pay our distribution and to run the business conservatively and stably. And I think, whilst they\u2019re not easy to measure in simple dollar terms, those are the criteria that we\u2019re really looking at. So, although the numbers need to work and the deal needs to stand on its own feet, if the deal itself risks damaging the Partnership, then we won\u2019t do it just yet.",
            "But, at the moment, the ideas that we\u2019ve got, don\u2019t do that. And if we can pull them off, we may be able to do it. But, as I said, we\u2019re certainly not there yet. And we\u2019re really just at the early to mid stages of looking at these ideas and putting them in place. But, we do have some realistic ideas for internal funding. And as I say, we\u2019ll operate it on a prudent basis. What it doesn\u2019t do is really solve our longer term problem. But, let\u2019s take one ship -- one step at a time."

            "So, first of all, I think we covered it a little bit earlier here with some of the Q&A, but looking at the Windsor Knutsen with the Shell contract coming off in October, that\u2019s going to impact Q4, right? Q3, looks like it\u2019s mostly covered. Is there any sort of sensitivity estimates on EBITDA or coverage that you could share with us? I know, you sort of -- you kind of spoke in general terms with the last question as per the goals of recontracting that. Is that going to be maybe a significant drop in daily earnings do you think or is it closer to maybe a 10% or 20% drop?"

         "Remarks": [
            "J., we didn\u2019t -- we debated about press releasing the situation with Windsor. But, actually, we as a Board and as a company, took the decision that actually we didn\u2019t think it was material enough to do that. And also, at the moment, we\u2019re in the middle of discussion. So, if you ask about impacting on Q4, our current best guess is that the vessel will get rechartered. So, at the minute, we\u2019re not publicizing, if you like, any negative side of Windsor today. That\u2019s not to say, it won\u2019t happen, and obviously internally, we\u2019ve gotten those numbers. But, I just sort of refer you back to what I said before that right now, we don\u2019t see the Windsor position is really pivotal to the Partnership right now. Our coverage is quite high. And Windsor is just one ship out of 16. So, it will or could have been impact, if we don\u2019t recharter it or there\u2019s a gap. But, we feel we\u2019ve got quite a cushion before we have to do anything more serious."

Related questions on that, so question one, you have three more Shell equipped shuttle tankers, the Tordis, the Vigdis and the Lena. Are those in a similar position or -- it looks like those contract structures are significantly longer? Can we read anything into those based on the Windsor, or is it a completely different field and setup there?",
            "And then, the second question is your next charter extension is the Bodil Knutsen with Equinor, looks like it comes off in May \u201821. I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s an option they can declare. And I\u2019m just wondering when that sort of timeline is for them to declare that next option?"

            "Sure. I\u2019ll tell you what I know about Shell, what we knew about Shell, which is perhaps not a lot. Shell quite rightly keep their commercial to themselves. I think, what we do feel is that Shell have got a chartering strategy. Right now, they\u2019ve got 8 -- we believe 8 shuttle tankers, 7 once the Windsor is dropped. And they\u2019ve got 4 more on order with AET. So, they\u2019ll end up with 11 within the next couple of years.",
            "I think, the supply-demand that we\u2019re looking at, suggests that they need 11 or 12. But, I would say that, to answer your question directly, we don\u2019t believe that Windsor and the Tordis, Vigdis and Lena are particularly linked. I think, it\u2019s a completely different situation for Shell in terms of how the vessels are used.",
            "I think, what I can say is that we are talking to Shell all the time, and we\u2019re talking to them now. So, there is a desire for us as a business to fix those vessels as soon as we can. And if we can fix them sooner, then we will, if we can persuade Shell to take options early.",
            "As for the Bodil, that\u2019s with Equinor. We\u2019re talking to them about putting on a VOC recovery plant system, which if that does go ahead, then we think that will necessitate a longer term contract, because Equinor will have spent a significant capital, some on the vessel. It\u2019s currently trading in Brazil. We think it may get transferred to the North Sea at some point. We are in close dialogue with Equinor and we may hear something by the end of the year on that. We hope the firm period ends per the charter contract in May 2021. So, we\u2019re hopeful to have some clarity on that vessel before the end of the year."

            "Excellent. We\u2019ll hope for some good news there in the Bodil, and yes, hopefully, the Shell ships are not correlated in that sense. Turning a little bit strategically -- two strategic questions for you, and then will turn it over. The first one on the financing. You mentioned, you\u2019re kind of overpaying debt. Obviously, the LIBOR rates have came way down and we\u2019re seeing a lot of your peers extending their derivative swaps at levels like 0.3, 0.4 for three, four, five years even. That\u2019s a fairly friendly interest rate environment. So, I guess, part one of that is, is it possible to extend the leverage based on those lower interest rates, right? Because it would be based on your total financing costs of both, interest rates and debt repayment. So, first of all, can we increase the leverage to fund dropdowns? And second of all, what has sort of been the reception, I guess, on the Board for further dropdowns? I guess you have seven available and you mentioned maybe one or two. Again, I guess, a little bit expanding on that the first analyst question, but just looking into what sort of credit market indications can we look for to get those dropdowns coming down?"

         "Remarks": [
            "I think, the short answer is, we are -- as a company and as a Board, I think we\u2019re comfortable to extend our leverage to fund dropdowns up to a point obviously. I know there\u2019s a strong market desire for leverage to be in the 3 times bracket rather than the 4 times bracket. But, we tend to feel that that is quite a broad-brush approach, which doesn\u2019t necessarily suit every company. I think, when you look at our cash flows and the amounts of debt that we are paying down, I think we can probably extend our leverage. And some of the internally financed options that I referred to earlier would probably result in a little bit of increased leverage. But, our modeling shows that notwithstanding that, it would come right back down again pretty quickly. And I think provided we message correctly and explain what we\u2019re doing and we show that that\u2019s the case, then I think, and we hope that the market will understand that it\u2019s for the greater good and that we will get an extra vessel, and with a long-term contract.",
            "The Board\u2019s view of further dropdowns is very positive. I\u2019ve said before on earnings calls that the Board just really wishes that the market was as it used to be. It worked very well for everybody. The Partnership dropped down 12 vessels after the initial fall, and it would like to carry on doing exactly the same. So, there\u2019s definitely appetite in the Board to take the vessels. But, you\u2019ll fully appreciate that the difficulty where we are at the moment with the unit price and the sentiment and all the things that surround the financing of this business at the moment, not to mention the fact that we\u2019re still an MLP and quite lot of people don\u2019t like MLPs anymore. So, it\u2019s a very tricky position for us right now. But, I think the conclusion of the Board is that we still can wait. Let\u2019s try and do something if we can, and it makes sense, but let\u2019s wait. And we\u2019ve seen $13 unit prices before, back in 2015. And then, subsequent to that, we were able to raise $200 million, and we got back up to $20. So, there\u2019s no reason why today\u2019s environment will last forever. And if we can navigate through these periods in these quarters now, as I mentioned in the presentation, we\u2019re in a good position."

It really depends on what they operationally want to do. I think, as I say, at the moment, we\u2019re not really modeling publicly anyway the scenario of no charter. We\u2019ve got a number of irons in the fire, not least of which is a charter to the sponsor. So, whilst we\u2019re in this position now and there\u2019s ambiguity, our suggestion is that we stick with the optimistic view of -- that the vessel will be chartered. So, until we\u2019ve got more information -- I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s probably where we\u2019re going. I think, all I can do is repeat a little bit what I\u2019ve said. It\u2019s 1 vessel out of 16. And we\u2019ve got good coverage right now. So, we\u2019re not panicking and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s pivotal."

So, those charges represent, as I say, the theoretical valuation, should we choose to terminate our interest rate swaps on the balance sheet date. Though, actually, none of them are cash items, there\u2019s obviously a breakdown, because inside there, there is an element of realized amounts, which relate to FX in particular. But the majority of those losses are paper-based evaluations for theoretical termination of the interest rate swaps. So unless we decide tomorrow to do that, then actually those large amounts that you see are nothing more than paper. And over the life of interest rate swap, they will eventually tend to zero on the balance sheet. To answer your question -- and not cash out of the door."

So, whilst it\u2019s performed very well, we just believe in the short term, Shell had some -- I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m -- this is where I\u2019m guessing, but potentially, they had some production cuts or production delays or et cetera. And they just decided to turn the vessel back. They\u2019re probably the second biggest player in the Brazilian market now, after Petrobras is a long way in front.

It has to be funded through debt, most likely of some form, and thus it\u2019s beneficial as I see it only to bankers. Would it change the dividend flow?

So, I think that\u2019s the primary driver to do it. And I think, we\u2019re looking at it from the point of view that, even if leverage is temporarily pumped up a little bit in order to do this, if we believe the Partnership\u2019s cash flows, even taking into account some levels of sensitivity can carry it, then we think, we can explain that and we think we can show that and that it\u2019s a good move for everybody. And I think it\u2019s helpful for us to show as a business that we are moving to a position where we are just about able to do this. It\u2019s kind of a bit of a holy grail for an MLP like us to be able to do that because we can then grow our business regardless of the markets. And I think that would be good for everybody if we got to that position. So, although we are completely aware of the leverage and the liquidity and the potential for problems in doing this, we do feel the extra cash flow security and the fixed contracting income that that will bring to us is worth it, provided we can do it in a secure manner."

I think, in all likelihood, the sponsor had a desire to have first refusal on any of those vessels, first of all. So selling them to the sponsor is also an option for a vessel swap even, an older vessel for a newer vessel coming in. Those sorts of ideas have been discussed at Board level. They\u2019ve not been ruled out. But, at the moment, we don\u2019t see there is a big need to do a transaction like that, that may change. And I think the answer to your question is, yes, it is on the table. But, right now, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re anticipating doing it."

I think, all I could say to that is, it depends on the vessels, the time and evaluations and the situation of the vessels in terms of charter values. Presumably the new vessel coming in would have a charter. And the only reason we would perhaps do it is if the old vessel going out doesn\u2019t have a charter. So, there\u2019s all kinds of moving parts in there to suggest the valuations could fluctuate quite a lot. So, I\u2019m going to have to pass on that question. Sorry."

And I think with our changing unit-holder base today, I think, we recognize that it\u2019s more important than ever that we both, seek out potentially new equity unit-holders but also support the ones that have coming more recently on the back of perhaps some of the institutional sellers going out. So, you\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s a little early to discuss specifics, but it was on the Board agenda yesterday. We had a good discussion about it. And we have some ideas and plans to take forward in the next quarter -- well, this quarter actually, Q3, into Q4. Just as an aside -- slightly different topic, but we\u2019re also working on an ESG publication as well, which at the moment, as a business, we don\u2019t have that. We\u2019ve got a lot of data, in fact, we\u2019ve got all the data that we need internally, but we don\u2019t publish it. So, we\u2019re doing that as well.

            "Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. And thank you for a great quarter. Just my question is, given where the share price and the disconnect between your cost of debt and cost of equity, I wanted to ask you like what is the hesitation to add to new dropdowns? And just as an aside, I don\u2019t think marketing a stable partnership with 16% yield is that difficult? You have a turnover of shareholders that have to sell. And you have an incredible universe of investors that are seeking 2% yields. So, I don\u2019t understand why the Board has allowed this arbitraged to develop. And this doesn\u2019t seem to me like a rocket science to remedy. It just you guys have to come out and emphasize to investors the advantages on the tax side that some of it is a return of capital? And, really, it\u2019s really a scorecard for the Board that your cost of equity is 16% and your cost of debt is 1.5%. I mean, can you -- I mean, the other question I would have is -- or a comment, people ask you what\u2019s the downside, if you do not recharter the Shell ship? Why don\u2019t you just say that it would reduce your coverage by X? And so, kind of insert some clarity into it, so we know what the worst case scenario is."

         "Remarks": [
            "Pavel, Thanks for your questions. I think on the arbitrage between the debt and the equity, we have NYK, the Japanese shipping company as part of our sponsor group. And as a result, we have access to Japanese banking lending on the debt side. And so, we\u2019ve ended up in a very fortunate position to have incredibly low costs of debt. That sort of pushes us one way. Obviously, the equity is -- has gone the other way, but largely driven by the market. If you look around at other companies, they\u2019re in exactly the same position as us. And some of those companies are just as good, maybe not MLPs, but just as good. You\u2019ve got larger companies, $5 billion companies in the high-single-digits and on the energy side. It\u2019s a difficult place to be at the moment.",
            "We can do more and I think we recognize that. We do need to come out and do more. I think where, historically we had institutional holders and a stable financial market, it probably was easy, whereas today we\u2019re in a different world. So, I think the equity has gone one way, swept along by the market in general terms, and the debt\u2019s gone the other way, because we\u2019re able to access probably some of the lowest debt costs in the world for the type of company we are. I think, we recognize we can do more, and that\u2019s our plan."

It\u2019s bringing in few of those would be very interesting addition besides stable shareholding. It\u2019s something that may be very interesting. And can you maybe also comment on what I asked, can you sort of put toward the downside if you do not recharter it? I mean, it\u2019s not that you won\u2019t recharter it, but at least as investors, we know what the downside is?"

So, I take your point that perhaps we could do more in terms of looking forward with sensitivities. And I think that\u2019s part of the IR story that we\u2019d be looking at.
