      "Bill Siwek": [
         "Thanks, Christian, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. In addition to Christian, I\u2019m joined today by Bryan Schumaker, our CFO. I will briefly review our second quarter results and business development activity, provide an update on the impact and response TPI is taking to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an overview of the current operational status of our manufacturing facilities; discuss the status of our supply chain; and finish up with a brief update on the wind energy market. Bryan will then review our financial results in detail. And then we will open up the call for Q&A.",
         "To start, the health and safety of our associates and their families as well as the communities in which they live remains our top priority, and we believe the safety protocols and practices we put in place in all of our facilities around the world in early March have enabled us to effectively manage the impact of the global pandemic on our operations and associates.",
         "Please turn to Slide 5. In the second quarter, we delivered net sales of $373.8 million, a 13% increase over Q2 of 2019, and adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 million. The estimated impact of COVID-19 on revenue and adjusted EBITDA during the quarter was $96 million and $36 million, respectively, which primarily related to wind blade sets that we had forecasted to produce in the second quarter under our supply agreements, but were unable to do so.",
         "On the wind side of our business, we announced today that we extended two supply agreements with GE: one in Newton, Iowa through 2021 with an option to extend through 2022; and one in Ju\u00e0rez, Mexico through 2022. We also announced that we will be adding an additional production line in Mexico to provide blades for GE\u2019s wind turbine technologies in North America.",
         "We also announced today that we signed a multiyear agreement with Nordex for two manufacturing lines in our Chennai, India facility with a planned start date of production in the first quarter of 2021. With these new manufacturing lines and contract extensions, we added approximately $800 million of potential contract value.",
         "Finally, with respect to Wind. So far this year, we\u2019ve also signed new global service agreements totaling approximately $15 million. As it relates to the transportation side of our business, we continue to produce commercial delivery vehicles for Workhorse during the quarter and expect to ramp our production throughout the remainder of 2020 to enable us to meet Workhorse\u2019s volume requirements for 2021 and beyond.",
         "We\u2019ve begun producing parts from the production tooling we talked about last quarter and expect to ramp our volume by the end of the year to meet volume needs of that new passenger electric vehicle platform in 2021. And we continue to make progress on several new and existing transportation opportunities and programs.",
         "We appointed Jim Hilderhoff as Chief Commercial Officer, responsible for all commercial activities at TPI. Jim has a diverse background both as a P&L and commercial leader within multiple GE platforms. Most recently, he held the role of Chief Commercial Officer North America division for Wabtec Corporation. The Wabtec Corporation merged with GE Transportation in February of 2019, creating a Fortune 500 company with $8 billion of revenue. Jim was responsible for the commercial integration associated with the merger. Jim brings over 30 years of commercial leadership experience at GE.",
         "Finally, we appointed Adan Gossar as Chief Accounting Officer. Adan brings over 20 years of accounting and finance leadership experience to TPI. Adan most recently served as Chief Accounting Officer of Reef Technology. And prior to that, Adan served as Corporate Controller for NASDAQ-listed Veritiv Corporation.",
         "Please turn to Slide 6. We remain committed to operating our business safely while working to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 by partnering with our customers and suppliers to make up as much of the lost volume as possible in each of our locations as our customer demand remains very strong. We also continue to drive the operational imperatives we outlined at the beginning of the year to reduce costs and improve our operations globally and are making very good progress on those imperatives, notwithstanding the challenges created by COVID-19.",
         "Finally, we remain focused on our liquidity to secure business continuity and ensure the long-term viability of TPI as we navigate these dynamic and unpredictable times. As of quarter end, our liquidity stood at $138.4 million. And we continue to manage it by deferring nonessential CapEx, controlling and reducing other costs and focusing on our cash conversion cycle. To that end, during the quarter, we amended our credit agreement to provide additional flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic and to support our planned capital expenditures and growth initiatives for 2020 and 2021.",
         "Turning to Slide 7. I\u2019ll now take us around the world and give you a quick update of our operations. During the second quarter, we continued with normal operations in all of our China facilities. We continue to expect to deliver more volume than our original 2020 plan, in part, the result of a customer pushing out a planned transition. We are in the start-up phase in our Chennai, India manufacturing facility, and we operated for most of the months of April and May with a reduced workforce due to the government of India\u2019s imposed curfew. We are now back to normal operations, moving full speed ahead on the start-up of that facility.",
         "We operated our Izmir, Turkey manufacturing facilities at approximately 50% capacity during the first half of April, primarily due to government-mandated stay-at-home orders in response to COVID-19, which resulted in demands from our union in Turkey to temporarily reduce production. This, as well as a shortage of core related to one blade model, caused the second quarter blade production to be slightly impacted. Since mid-April, however, we have been running our production at normal levels.",
         "We operated our Matamoros, Mexico facility at reduced capacity during April and May, and we shut down for a couple of weeks in June. In the middle of June, we restarted production and were ramped back up to 100% of production capacity by the end of July. Because we operated at reduced levels during all of Q2, our second quarter blade production was negatively impacted. We expect to be operating at or near capacity for the remainder of the year with no planned transitions.",
         "Due to the sanitary emergency created by COVID-19, three of our four factories in Ju\u00e0rez were shut down for approximately three weeks at the end of April and early May, while the fourth factory was shut down for approximately six weeks. Our Q2 volumes were negatively impacted, and our third quarter volumes will be slightly negatively impacted as well as we did not get back to 100% of our production capacity until the end of July.",
         "On April 23, 2020, we voluntarily paused production at our Newton, Iowa manufacturing facility due to an increase in COVID-19 levels in surrounding counties. We restarted production on May six after working closely with the governor\u2019s office and Iowa health officials to reopen the plant. Q2 volume was negatively impacted due to the duration of our production pause, but we have been back to normal production levels since late May. Finally, our operations in Rhode Island have not been materially impacted during the pandemic.",
         "Now an update on supply chain. As one would expect, our raw material suppliers have been impacted by COVID-19 as well. Our global supply team continues to do an excellent job of ensuring that our factories continue to operate during the pandemic by securing critical raw materials through alternative suppliers and/or locations as needed and executing our strategy of regional localization and long-term supply agreements to ensure a consistent, uninterrupted supply of key raw materials. We also took steps in the early stages of the pandemic to secure additional safety stocks of most key raw materials to reduce the risk or impact of any short-term supply disruptions. These proactive steps are reflected in a buildup of working capital, which will \u2013 Bryan will discuss later.",
         "We saw tightness in supply and core materials, balsa in particular, due to COVID-19-related challenges in Ecuador and overall market demand in 2020 as well as PET foam qualification delays also caused by COVID-19. To date, this has not had a material impact on our production. The raw material market is now essentially back to pre-COVID levels, and we don\u2019t expect any further supply issues at this time, barring any disruption from another significant wave of COVID-19. We are also working on reducing the build-up of inventory to more normal levels.",
         "As it relates to the wind market, as of today, demand remained strong from our customers for 2020 and 2021, with 2022 strengthening. According to Wood Mackenzie, while the pandemic continues to impact the global markets in the near term, nearly all capacity impacted in 2020 is pushed into subsequent years. So while COVID-19 is creating some difficulty in project execution in 2020, we expect the coming years to continue to be strong.",
         "In the U.S. in late May, in response to potential project commission delays in the U.S., the government issued a one-year PTC extension for projects that were to be completed at the end of 2020 and 2021, which will help to alleviate some of the installation and commission challenges exacerbated by COVID-19. Wood Mackenzie subsequently updated its U.S. forecast by 1.5 gigawatts for 2020 and 2021 and in that forecast, installations in 2021 to be at or near 2020 levels.",
         "Finally, as mentioned during the last quarterly call, several of our customers have indicated their desire to either cancel certain transitions due to strategic product decisions or to push them out to enable us to maximize production and reduce the amount of volume lost during those transitions. As a result, we currently estimate the number of transitions in 2020 will be approximately 70% less than we previously planned at the beginning of the year. However, we expect transition costs to only be 40% less as a result of delays caused by COVID-19.",
         "Turning to Slide 8. We now have a total potential contract value of up to approximately $5.4 billion through 2024, and the minimum guaranteed volume under our supply agreements is $2.9 billion. This is a net increase from $5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, from last quarter as a result of signing new contracts and extending existing contracts, which added approximately $800 million, offset by second quarter sales.",
         "The potential and minimum contract values do not include the two lines in China that we are operating under short-term contract this year, nor does it include the impact from some of the anticipated new larger blade models that we will produce after 2020 and 2021 transitions or additional contract extensions. While the health and safety of our associates remains our primary objective, we remain focused on our operating imperatives and continue to apply our scale to expand material capacity, ensure continuity of supply, drive operating costs down and focus on the integration of our key ESG initiatives to drive profitable growth and long-term shareholder value.",
         "With that, let me turn the call over to Bryan.",
         "Thanks, Bryan. Turning to Slide 14. The health and safety of our associates and their families as well as the communities in which they live remains our number one priority. As we reiterated today, we are taking the necessary as well as proactive steps on the COVID-19 front to ensure the safety of our associates and safe working conditions in our facilities.",
         "We continue to work our Wind pipeline in earnest. And notwithstanding the challenging environment, we are pleased that we were able to add more capacity for Nordex and GE while also extending two existing agreements with GE. The impact of these additions and extensions was to increase our potential contract value by approximately $800 million. We are also very encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made in the service space in a relatively short period of time. This will continue to be a focus for us moving forward.",
         "The progress we have and continue to make in the transportation space is also very exciting. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the increased interest, investment and activity in the electric vehicle space that we\u2019ve seen accelerate recently. We have now lost focus on our operating imperatives while mitigating the negative impacts of COVID-19 on operations during this time, and we are focused on managing our liquidity to provide financial security and to emerge stronger as we drive through this current environment.",
         "Our overall mission remains unchanged: establishing 18 gigawatts of global blade capacity to drive $2 billion of annual Wind revenue; reach $500 million of annual transportation revenue over time; and achieve double-digit adjusted EBITDA levels. We plan to continue to drive for more speed during start-ups and transitions, leverage our global scale for operating and buying efficiencies to continue to drive down cost, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet.",
         "I want to thank all of our dedicated TPI associates for their commitment to our mission to decarbonize and electrify, especially during these challenging times. We are confident we will emerge stronger from the current environment, and we remain very confident in our multiyear game plan. Thank you again for your time today.",
         "And with that, operator, please open the lines for questions."
      ],
      "Bryan Schumaker": [
         "Thanks, Bill. Please refer to Slides 10 through 12. All comparisons made today will be on a year-over-year basis compared to the same period in 2019. For the second quarter of 2020 ending June 30, 2020, net sales increased by $43 million or 13% to $373.8 million.",
         "Net sales of wind blades increased by 15.3% to $348.1 million. The increase was primarily driven by a 10% increase in the number of wind blades produced year-over-year largely as a result of increased production at our China facilities and Matamoros, Mexico facility.",
         "Net sales were adversely impacted by approximately $96 million based upon wind blade sets, which we had forecasted to produced in the period under our non-cancelable purchase orders associated with our long-term contracts but were unable to do so as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. We believe we can make up approximately 98% of the volume lost during the first half of 2020 in Q3 and Q4 of 2020 unless our plants are further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "Start-up and transition costs for the quarter decreased by $12 million to $10.9 million. However, start-up and transitions are being impacted by COVID-19 due to the temporary suspension of production at our India, Mexico and Turkey facilities.",
         "Our general and administrative expenses for the quarter decreased by $2.3 million to $6.9 million. G&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 100 basis points to 1.8% of net sales. This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in travel and training cost during the quarter. Before share-based compensation, G&A as a percentage of net sales was 1.3% and 2.2% in Q2 of 2020 and 2019, respectively.",
         "Our income tax expense for the quarter was $49.3 million as compared to $0.5 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a change in the forecasted annual effective tax rate as of June 30, 2020, in comparison to the forecast at March 31, 2020, and the earnings mix by jurisdiction period-over-period. More specifically, income tax for Q2 2020 was the result of applying a revised forecasted annual effective tax rate to a quarter that was significantly impacted by losses in several jurisdictions due to COVID-19. 2020 is also impacted by losses from an entity that is located in a tax-free zone.",
         "For the year, we are expecting tax expense to decrease 25% to 50% from the year-to-date tax expense amount as the jurisdictional mix of income changes over the back half of the year. We are forecasting our cash taxes to be approximately $15 million to $17 million for the year.",
         "Net loss for the quarter was $66.1 million as compared to net income of $1.8 million in the same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the reasons noted above. In addition, the net loss was adversely impacted by approximately $55 million associated with the production volume lost under non-cancelable purchase orders due to the reduction \u2013 reduced production and temporary suspension of production in our facilities in Mexico, Iowa, Turkey and India, along with other costs incurred primarily related to the health and safety of our associates in non-productive labor associated with COVID-19.",
         "Net loss per share was $1.87 for the quarter compared to net income of $0.05 per share for the same period in 2019. Net loss in the quarter was also impacted by a $6 million change in estimate of our warranty accrual. This is primarily associated with a warranty remediation campaign related to production prior to February 2020 with a specific customer and a specific blade model. With our varying customer blade types and locations, warranty issues are typically isolated to customer-specific blade models. Notwithstanding, we have put additional quality measures in place since early 2020 to prevent these types of quality issues from occurring in the future.",
         "We have adjusted our estimated reserve for this campaign based on our forecasted remediation costs and our contractual limit of liability. We are working closely with all of our customers to ensure that we do not have any additional material warranty exposure. Year-to-date, we have incurred approximately $8.5 million of warranty remediation efforts, and we are forecasting that we will incur an additional $16 million associated with warranty remediation efforts for the balance of the year.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $3.3 million as compared to $23.4 million in the same period in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by approximately $36 million associated with the production volume lost due to the temporary suspension of production in our Mexico, Iowa, Turkey and India facilities. The additional warranty provision and other costs related to COVID-19 that impacted all of our production facilities.",
         "We are forecasting that we will incur approximately $5 million of COVID-related costs on a quarterly basis associated with the health and safety of our associates until there are better treatment options and/or effective vaccine for COVID-19. In addition, we are expecting to incur higher direct labor costs associated with meeting our customer demands in Q3 and Q4 of 2020.",
         "Moving on to Slide 11. In June 2020, we amended our credit agreement to provide us with more flexibility to continue to manage our liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic and to support our planned capital expenditures and growth initiatives for 2020 and 2021. The amendment made certain adjustments to increase the permitted total net leverage ratio covenants through the end of March 2021. Our total net leverage ratio for Q2, as calculated under our covenants was 3.1%, which is well below our permitted total net leverage ratio of 4.25% under the amendment. We expect our total net leverage ratio to peak in Q3 before we see a decrease in Q4. Our long-term goal is to drive our total net leverage ratio back down to our desired level of 2%.",
         "Turning to Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $96.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, total principal amount of debt outstanding of $239.2 million and net debt of $142.5 million compared to net debt of $97.5 million as of the end of Q1 2020. For the quarter, we used $29.6 million of cash in operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by an inventory build of $25 million in the quarter as we built up our inventory to manage COVID-19 risk as well as the impact of COVID-19-related costs. The inventory build is a part of our inventory and contract assets balances on the balance sheet. We are strategically working to reduce our inventory balances throughout Q3 and into Q4 while we\u2019re closely monitoring any potential risk of COVID-19 on our production facilities.",
         "We continue to defer CapEx and focus on essential capital expenditures that are critical to the health and safety of our associates, critical to our operations and required to meet customer commitments. As a reminder, we withdrew our 2020 guidance on April 23, 2020, due to the rapidly evolving nature, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The variety of measures implemented by governments around the world to address its effect and the impact on our manufacturing operations.",
         "Although our plants are currently operating at or above plant capacity, several of our manufacturing facilities, in particular, in Mexico and India, are operating in regions with high levels of reported COVID-19-positive cases. As such, we may be required to reinstate temporary production suspensions or volume reductions at these manufacturing facilities or at our other manufacturing facilities, to the extent there is a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the regions where we operate or there is an outbreak of positive COVID-19 cases in any of our manufacturing facilities. Due to the fluid nature of COVID-19 and the potential impact on our business, we will not be providing 2020 guidance at this time.",
         "With that, I will turn it back over to Bill to wrap up, and then we will take your questions. Bill?"

That was something we were really kind of eager to hear about. And so that\u2019s great that you guys have had advances there. But could you tell us how many lines are covered by the 2G extensions?

And it\u2019s fantastic that you\u2019ve had so many customers willing to kind of cancel or delay, but what will that mean for 2021 and maybe Q1? Will there be a \u2013 is that going to mean a build-up of transitions that will hit in Q1? Or how should we think about that cadence?"

All of those aren\u2019t finalized yet for 2021 and for \u2013 or for 2022, but we can provide you with more information on that as we get closer to the end of the year."

And then we did the extension of the GE contracts, which are already in place in Iowa and Mexico along with an additional line in Mexico. So that\u2019s what makes it up.",

In terms of \u2013 maybe in terms of thinking about how kind of COVID is kind of rolled through your manufacturing network, it\u2019s like Q2 \u2013 the number of sets in Q2 was higher than Q1. Should we interpret from that, that the COVID impact in China in Q1 was similar or maybe even more severe than, say, kind of non-China in Q2? Or would it be more accurate to say maybe just the Chinese facilities kind of started working overtime in Q2 to make up for that delta?

            "You\u2019re right. China did run pretty hard in Q2 and made up some of that volume. And then because of the additional inventory and purchases due to 606 and other things, we did have some revenue recognized off of that $20 million, too, due to how that works mechanically, just to give you an idea for Q3 and going forward."

            "So when did that actually come back online? And then in terms of what you\u2019re seeing there, it\u2019s obviously in a high-risk area. Or would you classify the risk there being mostly governmental at this point? Or are you still seeing any degree of absenteeism [ph]?"

We\u2019re at 100% capacity as of today in that plant.",
            "So I think the risk for that plant and the risk, quite frankly, for Mexico, just remains COVID and how the government reacts to spikes or changes and what the level of testing and/or positive test may be. We\u2019ve worked very closely with the local as well as state governments of Chihuahua and Tamaulipas as well as the federal government. I think we\u2019re in very good position with them. We\u2019ve executed. We\u2019ve done what we told them we would do. So, I\u2019m not as concerned about our individual plants as it relates to government challenges there. I think we\u2019ve got a pretty good handle on that. It\u2019s just more of the \u2013 if there\u2019s a wider-spread outbreak in one of the locations."

It\u2019s not as much \u2013 I guess it\u2019s potentially about the government. But if we had a significant outbreak in an individual plant, then that could create a problem for us, right?

So we\u2019re not suggesting that, that\u2019s the only reason.
