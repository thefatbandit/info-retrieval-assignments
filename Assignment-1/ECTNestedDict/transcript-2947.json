      "Jacques Perron": [
         "Thank you. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2020 operating and financial results call. It is with a very heavy heart that I'm speaking to you today after a tragic loss of one of our employees this past weekend at Brucejack. Our thoughts are with the employee's family and loved ones, and also with every member of the Pretium family. The isolated incident occurred during maintenance at the support facility on the surface. We are fully cooperating with authorities and the investigation of the incident.",
         "The safety and well being of our employees is my most important priority. Although this was an isolated incident, it reminds us of the critical importance of safety in all aspects of mine site operations.",
         "On today's call, I will comment on our operational highlights for the quarter, the current status of our COVID response and our progress returning back to normal operations. Joining me on the call today is our CFO, Tom Yip, who will review the financial highlights of the second quarter. Following that, I will provide an update on our exploration plan for this year. At the end of my prepared remarks, Dave Prins, our Vice President, Operations, will join the call for one last time to address your questions on the results from the second quarter.",
         "Before I discuss this quarter's performance, I would like to emphasize that no quarter at Pretium is considered a success, unless it is accomplished safely. With that in mind, I would like to acknowledge our hard working and dedicated team. And despite the additional challenges presented by the COVID pandemic, we came through with solid gold production this quarter and record high free cash flow.",
         "Before we begin, note that our statements contain forward-looking information and future-oriented financial information based on certain assumptions. I refer you to the cautionary language included in our news release as well as the management discussion and analysis for the same period. These are available on our website and have been filed on SEDAR. Please note all dollar amounts mentioned on this call are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.",
         "The Brucejack Mine continues to be profitable. In the second quarter, we produced more than 90,000 ounces of gold, keeping us on track to achieve our annual production guidance. We generated record high free cash flow of $82.7 million and ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $124.7 million.",
         "Operations have continued through the COVID-19 pandemic under the guidance and directives provided by the authorities. We have taken significant steps to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and to protect our staff, their families and communities. COVID-19 did not have a direct impact on second quarter gold production, though certain mine site activities were delayed. There were no interruptions to the supply chain and increased inventory levels have been established. We continue to monitor the situation and will continue to evaluate the potential for longer-term impacts to mine production.",
         "During the quarter, as a precautionary measure to increase available liquidity, the company drew down $16 million of the revolving portion of the loan facility. The Brucejack Mine achieved a major milestone early in the quarter with a production of its 1 million ounces of gold. The production of 1 million ounces of gold in less than three years since start-up is a significant achievement for the Pretium team, many of whom have been with the project since exploration and construction. We are working to continue the successful operations at Brucejack for the benefit of our shareholders, employees and the communities in Northern British Columbia.",
         "Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we were pleased to announce that Patrick Godin has joined Pretium as Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Patrick's career of more than 25 years in the global mining industry includes exceptional leadership roles, as well as extensive experience in technical and operational roles. I have personally known Patrick for over 20 years and I'm delighted to have him on our team. We look forward to working with Patrick as his broad knowledge of the mining business and technical experience will be instrumental as we continue to drive Pretium's success.",
         "Turning to operations on Slide 8. In the second quarter, a total of approximately 327,000 tonnes of ore were processed, equivalent to a throughput rate of 3,596 tonnes per day. During the quarter, the mill operated below the permitted level of 3,800 tonnes per day due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, focused on lateral development and stope availability. The mill feed grade averaged 8.9 grams per tonne gold for the second quarter of 2020, above the estimated 2020 guidance range. Over the quarter, approximately 353,000 wet tonnes of ore were mined. We continued our lateral development at a targeted rate of approximately 1,000 meter per month.",
         "Over the first half of the year, we produced approximately 173,000 ounces of gold and we continue to expect to meet our full-year 2020 gold production guidance of 325,000 ounces of gold to 365,000 ounces of gold. For the remainder of 2020, production is planned to continue at an average rate of approximately 3,500 tonnes per day, due to planned shutdowns and an increased focus on waste management from accelerated lateral development. The average annual gold rate is expected to range between 7.6 grams per tonne and 8.5 grams per tonne at an average gold recovery of 97%.",
         "All-in sustaining costs were $950 per ounce of gold sold for the first half of 2020. Annual financial guidance has been updated to include costs for COVID-19 protocols, which are expected to remain in place for the remainder of 2020, as well as additional diamond drilling costs. Accordingly, we have adjusted our AISC guidance upwards by about $55 per ounce to a range of $960 per ounce of gold sold to $1,120 per ounce of gold sold.",
         "Free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was $124.6 million and already reaching our full-year forecast of $100 million to $170 million. With improved gold prices, our free cash flow forecasts for 2020 has been increased to a range of $205 million to $275 million, based on an average gold price of $1,800 per ounce.",
         "Foreseeable 2020 production guidance remains achievable, assuming there is no significant impact on operations at the Brucejack Mine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We outlined a number of initiatives we believe will help us optimize our stope design and improve overall performance. Our first priority remains increasing mine access. As we progress through 2020 lateral development, we will continue to focus on opening the mine. The increased development will improve access to reserves and enhance opportunities to blend material from multiple areas, supporting more consistent production. These efforts will benefit from scaling back our mill throughput to 3,500 tonnes per day on average for the remainder of the year.",
         "Moving to Slide 12. A reverse circulation drill program started earlier this year to increase the data density to enhance mine planning, improve stope design and ultimately optimize gold production. As a result of COVID-19 related restrictions, the RC drilling program was delayed. The program was introduced in staggered phases with the first drilling operation at the beginning of the second quarter. As the equipment and personnel became available, a second and third RC drill were commissioned and commenced drilling toward the end of the quarter. A total of approximately 22,000 meters of RC drilling were completed during the quarter.",
         "Infill drilling to improve reserve definition ahead of mining was put on hold at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of the first quarter in order to limit non-essential personnel at Brucejack. By the end of the second quarter, diamond drilling activity had resumed with four diamond drills on site, targeting reserves proximal to mine infrastructure to build stope inventory and provide flexibility for near-term mining. Infill diamond drilling in the second half of 2020 is planned to progress west toward the Brucejack Fault Zone and intended to support mining in the first quarter of 2021.",
         "Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to review our financial performance for the second quarter of 2020.",
         "Thanks, Tom. In addition to infill drilling and RC drilling of the defined mineral reserves, we plan to drill 25,000 meters of resource expansion drilling. Resource expansion drilling is expected to expand the current mineral resources at the Valley of the Kings, adding gold ounces to the life of mine. There is opportunity to expand beyond the currently defined mineral resource shell, where previous drill programs have indicated the continuation of high-grade gold mineralization.",
         "Here on Slide 25 is a section view looking east at the underground development. The new diamond drilling, highlighted with the blue drill lines, is planned to continue to the north, toward the West Zone and will target Inferred Resources and previously intersected mineralization outside of the current mineral resource shell. Stepping further out, we have over 12,000 square kilometers of mineral claims in the Golden Triangle in BC. The Brucejack Mine is at the top left of the property. The 2020 regional exploration program on the company's Bowser Claims is currently under way with crew and equipment mobilized to site. The exploration program is evaluating several distinct zones that have the potential to host Eskay Creek-style VMS deposits and high-grade epithermal related gold systems.",
         "The primary focus of the 2020 program is the A6 Zone, located approximately 14 kilometers northeast of Brucejack. The assays received from drilling the A6 Zone in 2019 showed high-grade silver plus copper. To follow up on the encouraging results of the 2019 program, 10,000 meters of drilling is planned. The 2020 program will also include about 3,500 meters of drilling at the Koopa Zone, the Hanging Glacier Zone, and the East Snowfield Zone.",
         "The grassroots exploration program will continue through the summer and will also include soil sampling, prospecting and regional mapping. We believe the best value for our shareholders is to continue to invest a portion of our cash flow in exploration at our existing claim package.",
         "Before opening the lines for questions, let me review the highlights of the second quarter. We continued to capitalize on the favorable gold environment with adjusted earnings of $49.2 million, equivalent to $0.26 per share. We generated a record high free cash flow of $82.7 million and we ended the quarter with a healthy cash position of $124.7 million. To sum up, we have successfully navigated an unusual quarter. And at this time, we remain on track to achieve our 2020 production and revised cost guidance.",
         "Thank you. That concludes the formal presentation. I will now turn the call over to the operator, who will open the lines for questions. Ariel?"

      "Operator": [
         "Thank you all for joining us this morning. Welcome to the Pretium Resources Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] The conference call today is being webcast live and available along with the presentation slides on Pretium's website at pretivm.com.",
         "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jacques Perron, Pretium's President and CEO. Please go ahead."
      ],
      "Tom Yip": [
         "Thanks, Jacques, and good morning everybody. We continued our track record of positive cash flows and profitability again this quarter as we have every quarter, since achieving commercial production on July 1 of 2017. For the quarter, we realized a gold price of $1,738 per ounce, an increase of 32% over the second quarter of 2019. With additional ounces of gold sold, we saw a 101% increase in earnings from mine operations and 170% increase in adjusted earnings. The robust gold environment enabled us to generate strong free cash flows, which increased 141% over last year's second quarter.",
         "Turning to Slide 16. During the quarter, we sold 96,047 ounces of gold compared to 85,953 ounces of gold in 2019. Despite comparable gold production for the quarters, there was a difference in sold ounces due to the timing of production and subsequent sales. The $419 per ounce increase in average realized gold price contributed to the 47% increase in total revenues of $166.6 million versus $113.2 million in 2019. Production costs increased $23 to $196 per tonne mill compared to the second quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to the COVID-19 protocols that were implemented in March, impacting employee salaries and travel costs, and costs associated with the departure of a senior executive. These two discrete items account for $20 per tonne.",
         "Turning to Slide 18. Our cost of sales, which includes production cash costs, depreciation and depletion, royalties and selling costs, averaged $1,109 per ounce sold for the quarter versus $970 for 2019. Depreciation and depletion expense increased in the quarter by approximately $100 per ounce as a result of the updated reserves we reported in March of 2020. The total cash cost averaged $749 per ounce sold for the quarter versus $702 for 2019, reflecting the incremental cost of COVID-19.",
         "We continued to show robust earnings from mine operations of $60 million in the second quarter compared to $29.8 million in 2019. After deducting our corporate G&A costs, we generated operating earnings for the quarter of $55.2 million compared to $25.5 million in 2019. We had lower interest and finance expense of $4.7 million compared to $8.8 million in Q2 2019, due to the lower outstanding loan balance and a lower LIBOR rate throughout the period. Lastly, we incurred $17.9 million of taxes during the quarter, consisting of $1.6 million of cash taxes related to the BC Mineral Tax and $16.3 million related to deferred taxes. This significant increase in our deferred taxes compared to 2019 is due to more ounces of gold sold at higher prices.",
         "Our effective tax rate continues to be impacted by the translation of our Canadian-denominated BC Mineral Tax pools. As we have reported in the past, we currently pay BC Mineral Taxes at the minimal rate of 2%, not 13%, as we draw down our significant tax pools. Based on the updated life of mine and current gold prices, we do not anticipate any cash taxes for federal and provincial income taxes for three years to four years. Thereafter, anticipate paying taxes at a rate of 36.5% on mine operating earnings.",
         "Net earnings for the quarter were $32.3 million or $0.18 per share versus $10.4 million or $0.06 per share for 2019. The adjusted earnings items we believe are not reflective of the underlying operations of the company. These are non-cash items consisting primarily of deferred income taxes and accretion on convertible notes. The adjusted earnings were $49.2 million or $0.26 per share for the quarter compared to $17 million or $0.09 a share in the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Turning to Slide 21. For the quarter, we generated a record $92.1 million of cash flow from operations. This continues our trend of positive cash flows from operations since start-up in mid-2017. After deducting cash used in investing activities, we generated $82.7 million of free cash flow or $0.44 per share. We began the quarter with $40.6 million, generated $92.1 million of operating cash flow, drew $16 million on our revolver and received $6.1 million from stock option exercises. This was offset by $19 million of debt service and $9.7 million spent on capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with $124.7 million in cash.",
         "On Slide 23, we show more details on our all-in sustaining costs. For the first half of 2020, we sold 176,508 ounces, tracking within our guidance range for the year. AISC totaled $167.7 million for the six months, which included $4.7 million for additional employee salaries and travel costs related to the COVID-19 protocols in the second quarter. AISC was $950 per ounce of gold sold for the first half of 2020. AISC guidance for the full year has been updated to include costs of continued COVID protocols to the end of 2020 in cash costs and additional infill drilling in sustaining capex. The AISC guidance increased to a range of $960 to $1,120 per ounce of gold sold. The increase of $50 to $60 per ounce is due to COVID-related costs of approximately $40 per ounce and increased drilling accounts for approximately $20 per ounce.",
         "Free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was $124.6 million at an average realized price of $1,677 per ounce. With improved gold prices, free cash flow guidance for the full year has been increased by $105 million to a range of $205 million to $275 million based on a gold price of $1,800 per ounce for the rest of the year compared to the original guidance using a gold price of $1,450 per ounce. We continue to benefit from the high gold prices and we will focus on preserving liquidity, while we operate under the COVID-19 uncertainties.",
         "Now back to you, Jacques."

         "Remarks": [
            "And building on what you just said, I mean, just going by your full year production guidance there and the revised all-in sustaining cost guidance, you're going to produce an awful lot of cash this year, which is a wonderful problem to have obviously. I mean at what point, should we expect Pretivm to return some excess amounts of that to shareholders via buyback, a dividend? Or should we more expect to see an acquisition? Is there a gold price where you think you might even experience something like that already this year?"

         "Speaker": "Heiko Ihle"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I think as we mentioned, and in particular, Tom mentioned this, we continue to want to be careful and ensure that we have sufficient liquidity in case we would have an outbreak due to the COVID pandemic. So we're being very careful right now. We're also starting to look at our plans for 2021. We're going to be working on that. We still have some infrastructure work to do around Brucejack, there's still some construction work to be done. We're looking at different investments to optimize, improve costs like electric equipment and other things.",
            "So definitely, in the second half of this year, we're going to have -- it's time now to start to work on our budget for next year. And we've been having discussion internally and at the Board level, with this gold price, if it stays where it is, you're correct, Heiko, we're going to be generating a lot of cash. And we want to do the best we can for the shareholders. And we'll analyze all opportunities and decide what is the most efficient way of use of our cash.",
            "There's probably some debt that we want to deal with at some point because we still have significant amount of debt on the balance sheet. And as I mentioned to others in the past, I would prefer to have less debt on the balance sheet. So there's a bunch of different competing demands for our cash and we'll be balancing all those in the coming months. And we'll probably be able to give you some more color on what we expect to do at the end of the third quarter or definitely at the beginning of next year."

So Jacques, just starting off now, you've been with Pretivm now for about four months and I believe you had a chance to get down to site as well. Can you provide us with any thoughts you have on current operations and/or improvements that you are looking at to bring over the next coming months?"

I'm taking Patrick Godin with me next week and we're going to be at site to do a very extensive visit there. So I've spent quite a bit of time. And as I mentioned in the past, I think the highlights of my initial visits are the quality of the infrastructure, in particular. The mill is a very good mill. It can produce a lot of tonnes and the recoveries are good and things are going well on the processing side of things. I was very impressed with how the team is managing the road on the glacier. I think it's the first time I do have to deal with a road and a glacier. and it's definitely a significant challenge, so a good job being done by the team there. Environmental social license to operate, that's very, very well done.",
            "The definite challenge at the Brucejack is the underground knowledge of the ore zone. So that's why we have decided to accelerate diamond drilling. We need to do more work to understand the geology. That's going to be an area of focus. Another area of focus is optimize productivity at the mine. There is ways to improve how we're doing. And one of the main target that I have is to increase lateral development, increase stope availability and advance our knowledge of the ore zones to be better prepared for planning and better prepared for optimizing the mine sequence. So that's -- those are the areas we're going to be focusing on.",
            "But I'd like to point out that due to the tragic event we experienced last weekend, one significant area of focus that I already had, but we're going to step it up a notch here, is on the safety side of things. We're not in the business of injuring people, and we're going to be spending a lot of time and effort in the coming months to get back on track to make sure that we do everything very well, in a profitable manner, but first and foremost, very safely."

Grade control drilling, I believe you did about 2,000 meters of drilling in Q2. Is that enough? Do you see that you need to do a lot more development or a lot more grade control drilling to get -- manage on dilution and stope availability and all that good stuff?"

We had very good performance in the month of June and in the month of July. We're very happy to see that we're trending in that direction, so we want to keep it up there. And on the drilling side, we want to continue to -- as we develop the -- one of the challenges that we have, Ovais, because of the development -- we have to catch up on development. We don't always have available stopes to go and production-drill them. As we open up new areas, we are going to continue to accelerate our production drilling to build up inventory. And we believe we're going to be in a much better position by the end of Q2, beginning of Q3 next year."

And you just mentioned that by the end of Q2 and beginning of Q3 of 2021, you think you're going to be in a good position to have stope availability ready. I was just trying to get some color on the stopes that you have available. Is the inventory sufficient for next year? We've had some issues in the past where there was some mixed messaging about the availability of stopes, and that's been a concern about actually delivering on your guidance."

            "Yes. I think right now, Anita, we're in, I would say, a decent position, much better than where we were. And I'll let Dave talk about this, but we're in a much better position than we were last year. But I'd like to see this improve, again, so that's why I think over the next 4 quarters, we're going to intensify our drilling to increase the number of stopes of the -- or the total tonnage of inventory that we have drilled off. But we're not in a bad situation, and we're definitely not where we were.",

Yes, we have built up, as Jacques mentioned, since mid-last year, we've -- and on the last call, I did state we're about 170,000 tonnes of inventory in front of us. We now have 186,000 as of the end of June, of which, there's probably 75,000 that is -- can be -- you've got access to go out there and mine it straight away. So we have been building up. We need to keep in mind we've also ramped up tonnage through that period and delivered more tonnes in Q4 last year. H1 this year was always going to be difficult. But I think the field is set, and now we're -- what we see moving forward to build this up with a little more ease than what we've done it prior to. So I think we're in a much better state.

If you look at the per-tonne slide, that's where that is. With respect to all the COVID increases and the increased drilling, it's in 2 spots. The COVID cost on Slide 23, that's primarily in the cash cost line. And the additional diamond drilling that Jacques spoke about is in the sustaining capital line. And that's why you see that we've moved up those costs by about $8 million on both fronts. So $8 million for the year on cash cost and $8 million on the sustaining capital expenditure line."

So we're pretty much, as of today, that's obviously done. End of June was 22,000. And we also stated that it was approximately 100,000 meters in this year's budget.

It has not made any impact on the block model so far because now as you can understand, we haven't been drilling much since the beginning of the year. It's really at -- since end of the -- end of June, that we started to drill in earnest. So we're still in the early stage of this program. We're going to be gathering all the information. We're going to be looking at all this, and we'll determine, probably toward the end of the year or beginning of next year, if we want to maintain asset as is, if we want to make some changes, how can we integrate the data with the block model.",

I would say the second quarter was not significantly better than what we expected, but a little bit. It was a little better.

So yes, there's going to be variability from day-to-day, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, but I think that's a point worth noting here that we're tracking along on the life of mine plan.

Currently, you were planning 1,000 meters per month of development. And given the uncertainty around COVID, in addition to your reduced processing capacity to 3,500 tonnes per day, do you think that development rate is enough to prepare for the unprecedented shutdown due to COVID?"

We were short on manpower, and we had to adjust, so we had a little dip in development, but we've recovered from there very nicely. And at the current rate at where we are, at 1,000 meter plus per month, we're in a good situation. I'd like to be able to accelerate that a little bit more. And definitely because we have more developments, we produce more waste, so we have more waste to move around the mine. So that is causing a little bit of bottleneck on how much ore we can move. So we have to balance all things. But we're working right now on plans to improve our ability to move more material, and I think we're going to be in a very good place early or very early next year, and maybe toward the end of this year, to go back to our 3,800 tonne per day average production rate going forward."

We continue to have good results. You saw first quarter results were good. Second quarter results were good. We continue to see good performance.

And I guess at 7 days, if it goes very well, and 10 days if it goes not so well, so that's what we're shooting for right now.",

            "So Anita, there are multiple tax pools that we are drawing down. I just hate to give you any specific numbers, but let's say that in aggregate, they may be in the order of over $1 billion. Generally, when we say current gold prices, the last time we looked at this, we ran it at around $1,800 per ounce with the new life of mine. So as we spend -- as you know, as we spend capital dollars, that goes into those pools and we draw them out against earnings. So that's sort of our best estimate at this point in time, three-plus years before we pay any income-type taxes."

I will conclude this call the same way I started it, by saying that while our company delivered good results this quarter, we also suffered a devastating loss with the fatality of one of our employees. This is the most tragic reminder of the importance of safety in all aspects of our operations. You have my personal assurance that safety is and will remain my top priority. I look forward to updating you in the coming months, and I wish everyone a good balance of your day and a great weekend. Thank you."
