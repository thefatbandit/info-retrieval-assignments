      "Jos\u00e9 Bogas": [
         "Thank you, Mar, and good morning to everybody. As usual, I would like to start by commenting on the main highlight of the period. In the first semester of 2020, we have continued to deliver solid financial results. EBITDA increased by 22% compared to last year, 3% on a like-for-like basis, excluding extraordinary impact for the net effect of personnel provision for \u20ac356 million booked in the first quarter. This positive performance was mainly driven by the resiliency of the liberalized business against the COVID-19 backdrop.",
         "During the second quarter, we have seen a strong acceleration of the decarbonization of our generation mix with the closure of all Mainland domestical fleet last June 30. Additionally, the steady base of the regulated distribution business has greatly contributed to mitigate the adverse backdrop effects seen so far. On the bottom line, net income increased by 45%, 11% in a like-for-like basis.",
         "Moving now to Slide number four. Before analyzing operating and financial performance of the period, let me spend the next couple of slide commenting on the macroeconomic and regulatory backdrop against which we have operated throughout the year. Starting with the market context, characterized by the sharp downturn in the Spanish economy seen during the first half of the year. The COVID outbreak has unrelated \u2013 lockdown has led to an economic downturn of 22% GDP over the period. This extraordinary situation has caused a collapse in demand, commodities and food prices, in Mainland and non-mainland demand dropped by 8% and 13%, respectively. This, together with a general bearish scenario on commodities caused the average pool prices to plummet by 44% to \u20ac29 per megawatt per hour.",
         "When it comes to our business, the resiliency of our integrated business model has been ensured by a combination of a higher proportion of regulated activities not affected by the demand drop. Suppliers portfolio, geographical diversification that guarantees a very limited disruption on the supply chain and a leading customer position as well as a diversified customer base. From a financial standpoint, Endesa combines an extremely healthy leverage position and limited refinancing requirements coming in no exposure to current rigs.",
         "To conclude, we expect a limited impact from the current market backdrop, thanks to the resiliency provided by our integrated business model, our loan cash position and our hedging policy, ensuring a natural protection, again up yields. This, together with the strength of Endesa\u2019s balance sheet, allow us to comfortably navigate throughout this period and confirm the dividend policy announced in the strategic plan.",
         "Let\u2019s now take a look at the different initiatives taken so far by the different administration in supporting the economic recovery on Slide number five. Today, more than ever, the regulatory initiatives, both at the European Union and national level must play a key role to set up a favorable investment framework to spark up the economic turnaround. The green deal, the next-generation fund and the third transition mechanism has been the device to help the transition and the economy relaunch while ensuring shorter support for the most vulnerable sector. All of these European initiatives will be key pillars to facilitate a post COVID-19 economic recovery plan and represent a strong support for sustainable investment through a public and private investment boost.",
         "Considering the next-generation fund, an agreement has been reached which entitle Spain to receive approximately \u20ac140 billion of which \u20ac72 billion in grants equivalent to 7% of GDP, increasing the possibility of a faster GDP recovery during 2021. As far as Spain is concerned, latest regulatory development like Royal Decree Law 23 for the energy transition and economy recovery is a major step in the right direction as it brings clarity and stability to relevant items required to speed up the energy transition.",
         "At Endesa, we can play a meaningful role in the recovery in Spain through the resiliency of our business model as well as our financial flexibility with an adequate framework and the necessary regulatory and fiscal measures being implemented, we could raise our CapEx plan by approximately 30%. We have devised an accelerated plan of \u20ac7.5 billion, an incremental around \u20ac1.7 billion over 2020, 2022 period, by which we expect to become one of the Spanish companies with the largest investment brand having a multiplier effect on the country\u2019s GDP of \u20ac2.7 billion and being enable to generate 12,000 direct and indirect jobs and around 27,000 in deal jobs during each of the years of this project. Endesa is also in Italy in the social and economic impact of COVID-19 by implementing a series of other action aimed at supporting customer suppliers and employees.",
         "Entering into the operational performance of this for half 2020 on Slide number six. Overall CapEx was equal to \u20ac0.6 billion. Renewables accounted for the lion\u2019s share with 37% of the total CapEx channeled mainly towards the development of new capacity. Distribution business followed with 31%, mainly devoted to great digitalization, a key cornerstone of our business plan. Conventional generation and retail segment, including Endesa X, received 21% and 12% of the total investment, respectively. Around 45% of the total investment was devoted towards development, especially in renewables and to a lesser extent in distribution.",
         "Before diving into the financial performance, I would like to review the progress \u2013 a comment on the main achievement made so far of our key strategic pillars in the period. On Slide number seven, we can see that renewable capacity represents now around 44% of total Mainland capacity, and we are well on track to reach the 60% target set out in our business plan once imported coal plants will be phased out by 2021, around 0.9 gigawatts of new renewable projects brought into operation at the end of 2019 have partially compensated the thermal output loss with coal out in 2019, while contributing in reaching a record renewable output of 7.4 terawatt hour, or a 2.5 terawatt hour increase versus first half of last year. As a result, the share of emission-free production increased to almost 90%, 16 percentage points higher than in the first half 2019.",
         "Moving on to Slide number eight. To ensure not only current business plan target, but also an on solid capacity addition pace, we are continuing to increase our pipeline of renewable projects. Our total pipeline now stands at 24 gigawatts with a significant weight of solar around 70%. Out of these pipelines, around 30% has TSO awarded connection points.",
         "Moving on to Slide number nine. The decarbonization of our generation mix has accelerated and is detailed in Slide 9. Last June 30, 2.1 gigawatts of Endesa coal-fired generation, accounting for more than 40% of this technology-stored capacity was formally disconnected, representing a decisive step in the gradual phase out of our coal fleet. Moreover, during 2019, we submitted the formal application to close down Litoral and As Pontes imported coal power plants, which will be phased out by 2021, 1-year ahead the announcement in the last Capital Market Day.",
         "Along with these requests, we have developed gas transition plants based on a shared value creation approach to the specific generation side. These plants include significant investment in new renewable energy facilities in the surrounding areas, which will lead to the creation of direct jobs, not only for the dismantling of the coal-fired plants, but also for the construction of new ones enhancing activity and employment, thus mitigating the impact on the affected areas. A relevant consequence of these closure process has been the low percentage of income from coal, reaching a level of around 1% from total revenues and progressively decreasing towards 0% in the upcoming years.",
         "Advancing on to Slide number 10 regarding networks. Endesa\u2019s distributed energy suffered from the drop in energy demand, a consequence of the lockdown effect, representing a reduction of 8% year-on-year. Operational performance indicators showed a slight disparity. Losses reached 10.3% or 0.4 percentage points increase versus last year, impacted by the COVID backdrop. Let me underline that we continue to use all the tools at our disposal to return to the path of reduction that we were on.",
         "Regarding the minutes of interruption, a drop by 3% to 22.1 minutes in comparative terms adjusted by the effects of being focused on increasing efficiencies, OpEx spend per end user declined by 3%, thanks to the efforts in digitalization, operational optimization.",
         "Distribution in Spain enjoys a stable framework and remuneration is not exposed to volumes. In this framework, we continued to progress on our network digitalization process, which will enable us not only to improve the grid efficiency and resiliency, but also to integrate a growing amount of new renewable capacity.",
         "Moving on to Slide 11. We detail the retail and Endesa X businesses. The drop in Spanish demand has led to a 10% decrease in total gross sales, affecting mainly B2B, minus 14% or minus 4.5 terawatt hour, strongly hit by the deceleration of the economy. When it comes to the breakdown by segment, industrial sales decreased by 11%, that is a 2.4 terawatt hour, while SME shrunk by 31%, that is minus 1.5 terawatt hours.",
         "The total customer figure slightly decreased by 1%, 0.1 million customers due to the increased competitive intensity in the sector. These customers loss together with the abnormally milder temperatures during the winter, explain the small decrease in the B2C segment. As you know, through Endesa X, we aim at capturing the opportunities coming from new value-added services and infrastructures. In terms of infrastructure development, we needed to support electric mobility, the number of charging points installed grew significantly by 14% to 5,700 compared to full year 2019. Endesa X increased its e-Home contract by 6% to a total of 1.8 million, excluding third-party billing customers.",
         "And now I will hand over to Luca Passa who will present the details of our financial figures.",
         "Thank you, Luca. To close this presentation, I would like to conclude with some remarks on our performance in this first half. In spite of the current backdrop, in the first half 2020, Endesa has offered a sound underlying performance, providing comfort towards full year targets. The resilience of our integrated business model based on a stable regulated EBITDA, a consistent liberalized business, a long customer hedge and a robust financial strength are allowing us to cope with the volatile evolving scenario.",
         "A strong commitment at accelerating the energy transition also leveraging on sustainable finance. And also, we remain strongly committed to protecting our people and supporting our communities against the pandemic disease with the same engagement we have demonstrated its outbreak.",
         "As of 30th June 2020, expenditure on donation corresponding to the public responsibility plan purchases of supply related to COVID-19 amounted to count. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our first half 2020 results presentation. Thank you very much for your attention, and we are ready to take some questions."

      "Luca Passa": [
         "Thank you, Pepe, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I\u2019m now on Slide 13, further deeper in the analysis of the main operating and financial performance of the period. The reported EBITDA increased by 22%. Net income rose by 44 \u2013 45% to \u20ac1.128 billion. On a like-for-like basis, once netted from the previous mentioned, non-recurrent effects, EBITDA would have increased by 3% to \u20ac1.959 billion, while net income would increase 11% to \u20ac861 million. Funds from operation reached around \u20ac1 billion, 10% above last year. Net debt increased by 11% versus full year 2019 to \u20ac7.1 billion, the change is mainly attributable to the interim dividend on 2019 results paid in January this year, amounting to \u20ac741 million.",
         "Moving now to Slide number14. Before moving to the detailed analysis of the semester, let\u2019s have a look at COVID-19 estimated impact on our financial results. While the lockdown had a little impact on our activity in the first quarter, the second quarter reflects more negative implication as the state of alert in Spain was extended from March 14 to June 21. As of today, it\u2019s very difficult to estimate future COVID-19 impact due to the main uncertainties on the recovery path and time frame.",
         "As of end of June, we have estimated a net impact of around \u20ac80 million at EBITDA level, mainly due to lower demand, and \u20ac20 million in D&A from the update of bad debt provisions in accordance to IFRS 9. And net income level said impacts would translate to around \u20ac75 million.",
         "In absence of these estimated impacts, our like-for-like EBITDA would have shown an 8% increase to \u20ac2.039 billion, and our net ordinary income would have increased a remarkable 21% to \u20ac936 million. We expect a new normality period in the coming quarters to bring more stability to the economy. On the medium to long run, the current emergency should not have any meaningful impact on our company\u2019s forecast. All that make us confident to reach our 2020 announced targets net of extraordinary provisions already commented.",
         "And now I would like to comment on the market context of the period on this financial release. And I am now on Slide 15. The Spanish Mainland demand fell by approximately 8% versus previous year, already picking up on the full impact of the economic crisis unleashed by the pandemic. Since the declaration of the emergency stage till now, electricity demand has fallen minus 10.2%. April and May were the worst months impacted by the lockdown and the 15 days out of non-essential activities in April.",
         "In June, we have seen some demand recovery all in all, Mainland demand in Q2 fell 13%. During the month of July, demand is still negative, but shows some signs of improvement, thanks to economic activation. The sharper falls affected industrial demand and SMEs impacted by restriction economic activities, while residential demand increased due to the confinement In a similar way, in Endesa concession area, gross demand decreased by 7% and even lower in adjusted terms with a contraction of 7.4%, mainly in the second quarter with demand variation of minus 11.3%, and minus 11.8% in adjusted and non-adjusted terms, respectively.",
         "This development is mainly driven by the drop in the industry and service segments for the above mentioned reasons, barely offset by a slight increase in the residential sector activity. In that context, pool price continued to remain depressed in the second quarter suffering from a combination of lower demand, low commodity prices and high hydro production. Spending wholesale prices averaged \u20ac29 megawatt hour in the first half, showing increase of 44% versus the same period in 2019.",
         "In any case, during July, we are witnessing a recovery of pool prices, averaging above \u20ac34-megawatt hour in the first week of the month. Demand decrease, declining commodity prices and lower pool price shape the context in which Endesa operated during the first half 2020.",
         "In this context, I\u2019m now on Slide 16, electricity sales in the liberalized business decreased in Spain and Portugal by 11% in terms of volume, minus 4.4 terawatt hours. The user integrated margin resulted in \u20ac35 megawatt hour, showing a 25% increase year-on-year versus the \u20ac27.9 megawatt hour on first half of 2019. The same margin increase has been possible, thanks to the positive management of the short position, while generation and supply margins barely show variation versus the previous year\u2019s levels.",
         "Within the generation margin, the better generation mix supported by higher hydro and renewable output and the positive procurement margins in the combined cycles were mostly offset by lower thermal margins and the negative from the removal of the 7% generation tax applied in first quarter 2019.",
         "In supply, the positive margin effect with unitary supply margin increasing from \u20ac9 megawatt hour in first half 2019 to \u20ac10 megawatt hour in first half 2020 aligned to the levels of full year 2019 was offset by the lower volume effect as sales decreased by 4.4 terawatt hour in the period. Full year expectation at this stage point to a flattening of the margin in the coming quarters, with the full year aligned to our guidance in absolute terms, while unitary margin is now expected to be around \u20ac31 megawatt hour as a consequence of lower sales volumes driven by demand decrease.",
         "Lastly, we have already hedged about 100% of our 2020 estimated price-driven output at an average all-in price of \u20ac74 megawatt hour, with an estimated all-in for integrated sales, including index energy of \u20ac64 megawatt hour. For 2021, we have hedged around 92% of our estimated price-driven output at an average oil price of around \u20ac72 megawatt hour, once we consider our total sales mix, debt only in revenue, including index energy, we\u2019ll convert to levels similar to 2020 reference.",
         "And finally, for 2022, we have started the hedging process by around 30% of our estimated price-driven output, mostly to our residential customer with an estimated all-in price similar to 2021 at \u20ac72 megawatt hour. We are now noticing the beginning of a rebound of prices in the fore market that make us confident to hedge the remaining volumes at earlier references.",
         "A few words on the gas business on Slide 17. Total sales have decreased by 13%, mainly as a consequence of the warm temperatures that affected domestic and international customers, the global situation of gas oversupply and the worldwide demand slowed down caused by the COVID starting in March. Total customers remain almost flat, increasing by 8,000 in the coal segment due to the active client attraction campaigns. This has been achieved despite the strong competitive intensity registered this year that led to 1 percentage point increase in the churn rate year-on-year.",
         "Our unitary gas margin climbed to \u20ac4.1 megawatt hour. Despite lower demand, thanks to a better sales price references versus procurement costs. And we have continued to take advantage of the arbitrage among markets and of the flexibility of our contracts. Retail and home sale margins have both increased versus last year, which was affected by a different market scenario characterized by much higher prices than the current ones. These margins include a positive mark-to-market effect from our gas derivative contracts which will be flattened out over the year. Excluding this effect, the unitary margin would have amounted to approximately \u20ac3.2 megawatt hour.",
         "Moving to the retail analysis of EBITDA on Slide 18. Let me now briefly set out to the main drivers. As already commented, once deducted extraordinary effects booked in personnel costs and this EBITDA stood at \u20ac1.959 billion, plus 3% versus first half 2019. Generation and supply EBITDA rose by 21% to \u20ac903 million, supported by a sound increase in the integrated electricity, plus \u20ac126 million, and gas margins, plus \u20ac76 million. Distribution EBITDA decreased by 4% at \u20ac988 million. Finally, non-mainland generation EBITDA reached \u20ac68 million, a 45% decrease. I will comment deeply each business performance later on.",
         "On Slide 19, a quick follow-up on our efficiency program, which is consistently proving to be effective across all our business lines, containing costs despite growth and investment effort. Total reported fixed cost reached \u20ac607 million or 39% decrease over last year figure. Once deducted non-recurrent effects, fixed costs would have increased by 1.5%. Adjusted figures exclude mainly the provision reversal from the commitments contained in the new collective agreement, an additional provision recorded for workforce restructuring plans in the first quarter, and the updating provision for workforce restructuring plans already in place. Our OpEx evolution remained stable versus previous year with efficiency and positive effect from inflation, partially offset in perimeter and growth with higher CapEx in a new investment cycle.",
         "The strong effort in renewable capacity development is leading to a slight increase in the unitary fixed cost, reaching \u20ac47,000 megawatt, in first half 2020 from \u20ac46,000 megawatt in first half 2019 on an annualized basis, which will be reduced as the new capacity is brought into operation.",
         "In distribution, the digitalization initiatives of our processes and assets are bringing reductions in our operational cost with \u20ac41,000 end user from \u20ac42,000 end user last year. Lastly, in supply, we have lowered the cost to serve to \u20ac10.2 customers from \u20ac10.6 customers. This is a consequence of leveraging on the digitalization initiatives such as the following: the number of contracts with the building rose by 20% versus first half 2019 up to 4.2 million contracts; digital sales climbed from 10% in 2019 to 15.0 in 2020. While the number of digital contracts have gone to 5.1 million, up 13%.",
         "Note that the COVID backdrop has boosted the digital interaction with customers, getting very close or even exceeding the target set in the strategic plan for 2022. Finally, the new collective agreement signed with the union is expected to bring stability and increase efficiencies in the coming years.",
         "Focusing on the regulated business, on slide \u2013 I\u2019m now on Slide number 20. EBITDA decreased by 8% to \u20ac1.56 billion, with a lower gross margin, while fixed cost dropped by 10%. Distribution margin decreased by 5%, mainly due to the application of the new remuneration parameters of the second regulatory period for 2020, 2025. On the other end, at EBITDA level, it must be highlighted the improvement of adjusted fixed cost by \u20ac28 million. This is mainly the results of certain inefficiencies \u2013 sorry, the non-mainland generation gross margin decreased by \u20ac69 million, mainly due to the loss of fuel margin due to the fallen international markets and O&M compensation.",
         "This is mainly the result of certain inefficiencies in the current regulation that do not allow for the full recovery of fuel cost in a very volatile market context, which have been aggravated by the current low commodity references. In this sense, results have been severely impacted by the negative margins from full compensation, the application of new remuneration parameters and lower income from lower demand, partially offset by an improvement in adjusted fixed costs. We expect to notice a recovery in the same command for the year once the emergency state has been lifted and demand and commodity prices are returning to normalized levels. In addition, the secondary compensation should help us to improve current fuel settlement, providing a partial pass-through of the cost.",
         "On the liberalized business, on Slide number 21, EBITDA reached \u20ac903 million or a remarkable 21% increase, backed by \u20ac166 million improvement in gross margin. This some margin increase has been possible, thanks to: the increase in electricity integrated margin was driven by the positive management of the compared position, while generation and supply margin barely showed variation versus previous year levels. With the generation margin, the better generation mix supported by higher hydro and renewable output and the positive procurement margins in CCGTs were mostly offset by lower thermal margins and the negative from the removal of the 7% generation tax adopted in first quarter 2019.",
         "In supply, the positive margin effect with unitary supply margin increasing from \u20ac9 to \u20ac10 megawatt hour in 2020 aligned to the levels of full year 2019 was offset by lower volume effect as sales decreased by 4.4 terawatt hours in the period. In gas, gross margin reached \u20ac140 million, showing a remarkable 120% increase, including the mark-to-market referred earlier, despite lower demand and thanks to better sales price references versus procurement cost. We have managed to take advantage of the arbitrage among markets and the flexibility provided in our contracts.",
         "In Endesa X, gross margin increased by 11% to \u20ac63 million. Fixed cost increased by \u20ac8 million when compared to last year once deducted the net provision release effect. Moving now to Slide 22 on the P&L evolution from EBITDA to net ordinary income. Starting from the \u20ac2.35 billion reported EBITDA, D&A decreased by 4% to \u20ac760 million, driven by the impairments on our generation assets carried out last year, partially offset by the adjustment on the nuclear fleet useful life set on the nuclear protocol and the higher amortization in Enel Green Power. Bad debts increased by \u20ac26 million, out of which \u20ac20 million attributable to IFRS 9 as commented before. Net financial results decreased to minus \u20ac48 million, mainly driven by the impact of the update of financial workforce and dismantling provisions due to the lower decrease of interest rates year-on-year.",
         "Income tax expenses amount to \u20ac382 million, 65% higher than in 2019, driven by the net positive impact of the \u20ac356 million booked in the personnel expense line, which has an impact of \u20ac89 million at net income tax level.",
         "Effective tax rate stands at 25.2%, higher than the 22.9% recorded in first half 2019, mainly due to lower finance fiscal deduction. As a result, net ordinary income increased by 45% over the period. Moving to Slide 23 on the cash flow evolution from EBITDA to free cash flow. Funds from operations increased by 10% versus first half 2019, reaching \u20ac995 million due to the following effects: higher EBITDA after provision paid and net provision release of around \u20ac115 million; working capital and others slightly worsened by 16%, mainly due to other non-cash provisions and the effect of derivatives and commodity evaluation, which could not be offset by the improvement of changes in working capital, mainly thanks to the improvement of regulatory receivables, mostly from non-mainland compensation.",
         "Income tax decreased by 69% to \u20ac22 million, mainly due to the higher corporate tax refund in first half 2020. The cash-based Capex, 30% lower than in first half 2019 also led the free cash flow to be positive of \u20ac153 million in the first half increasing by \u20ac237 million versus first half 2019.",
         "And now moving to Slide 24 on the evolution of net financial debt. Net debt amounts to \u20ac7.92 billion, almost \u20ac700 million higher than the previous year. This increase is mainly driven to the payments of \u20ac746 million in dividends corresponding to the interim gross dividend against 2019 interim results. The regulatory working capital decreased to \u20ac867 million, mainly due to non-mainland system compensation collected this second quarter. The leverage ratio remained stable at 1.7 times. Gross debt has an average cost of 1.8%, similar to the one recorded at the end of 2019. Our latest guidance for the full year 2020 net debt, point to a \u20ac7 billion guidance based on the assumption of \u20ac1.2 billion of other working capital assuming the cash-in during the second half of 2020 of some pending amounts in non-mainland in accordance with the recently approved Royal Decree on network codes.",
         "In order to support our strategy, I\u2019m now on Slide 25, we are focused on increasing the use of sustainable finance tools within our reliability management activity and encouraging our counterparties and stakeholders to share our vision. The aftermath of the pandemic outbreak to bolster the company\u2019s equity position, Endesa has executed two sustainability-linked club deal bank facilities for an aggregated amount of \u20ac550 million. In addition, upon renewal of the Euro Commercial Paper Program, Endesa set new milestones by including an SDG indicator therein to become the first corporate in Europe to formally list on SDG ECP program. Following the execution of these transactions in second quarter 2020, sustainable finance accounts for 44% of our total gross financial debt. Considering solely, third party debt, this percentage increased to 74%.",

As of June 30, we face estimated net impact, as Luca has said of \u20ac8 million at EBITDA level mainly due to the [indiscernible] COVID-19 impact. Economy shift stabilize, allowing for a more normalized [indiscernible] the second quarter should be the most they are going to particularly solve [indiscernible] by investors so far, will allow to fulfill the commitment guidance of the year, net of the effect of the provision release, that is \u20ac3.9 billion at EBITDA level and \u20ac1.7 billion at net \u2013 ordinary income level. In addition, I would say that Endesa has a sound balance sheet with low leverage and robust liquidity, standing out 23 months and reinforced with the last agreement signed, implies a very wide margin of safety."

We expect this impact to be partially absorbed by year-end in the region of 50%. We recon that some working capital pressure is inevitable, but Endesa balance sheet is sufficiently strong to handle this temporary increase. And when it comes to, say, our estimates on net debt guidance for the full year, the guidance is now at about \u20ac7 billion based on the assumption of \u20ac1.2 billion of regulatory working capital, assuming the cash in during the second half of some pending amounts in non-mainland corresponding to low 15 taxes in accordance with the recently approved Royal Decree on network codes.",

We also see this decrease in revenues will be temporary and therefore unlikely to jeopardize this system balance.",

Regarding the renewable project, some of the 500 megawatts we are building will suffer, I would say, minor delays, mainly as a consequence of backlogs in the permitting process during the lockdown period.

Regarding the procurement cost, we have continued to take advantage of arbitrage between markets and the management of our supply contracts, whose flexibility has allowed us to purchase cheap asset on the spot market. Our full year expectation, we are not seeing material impact from lower demand in 2020 as the lower demand has been offset by good changes in the spot market.

In this regard, the minister for energy transmission expects to host renewables auctions before the end of the year, and Endesa certainly plans to participate. The proposed new mechanism for the auctions, similar to what is applicable in other European countries, said that the auction will be based on fixed prices per megawatt hour with a pay as billed system instead of lowest CapEx per megawatt offer.",

We believe the mechanism introduced in the Royal Decree to avoid market distortion is, as I have said, reasonably well designed, but it can still be improved in the final version. Regarding the new capacity payments, we have already \u2013 we have always insisted on the need of approving a new scheme reviewed and granted by the European Union to assure that hydro, nuclear and combined cycles may act as warrants of the needed security supplier of the system once the massive installation of renewable capacity foreseen in put it at risk.",

Our overall opinion on Royal Decree 23 of the year is positive as it should speed up, in our opinion, the energy transition in Spain, a key driver for the economic recovery. Specifically, on the rules for the connection rights, we think they will rationalize the process of increasing the normal capacity over the next decade, reducing speculation, whilst improving visibility and lowering costs. The purpose of the Royal Decree is to allocate license among renewable projects that are realistic and true, avoiding previous speculations. Concerning our pipeline as we have seen on Slide 8, it amounts to 24.3 gigawatt with a significant weight of solar around 70%. Out of this pipeline, around 30% has transition system operating, TSO, awarded connection points.",

As a consequence, I would say, of the delay of the ministerial order of fuel compensation and certain disfunction of the price recognition formula, negatively impacted by the sharp drop of the international commodity market in the period. Current regulation settles the fuel cost for every semester in accordance with the average spot reference in that period, which is unrelated to supply conditions from fuel suppliers.",

During the first half of this year and especially in the second quarter, gas and brand prices collapse triggering, stress on our revenue from fuel compensation. We expect this situation to improve sometime in the third quarter once the commodity cores are showing some rebound trying to return to normalized levels.",

It was on hold during the state of emergency situation, but we now expect the ministry to resume this draft, hopefully, during the next month. The draft order includes \u2013 or will include price reference, as requested by Endesa, for liquid fuels, but maintains at today, natural gas price that do not reflect in our opinion, the real cost. Therefore, initial draft does not allow a full pass-through of the fuel cost, and Endesa has presented allegation to this respect.",

            "This is because the tax increase brings the risk of generating economic constraints in companies and individuals, while a policy of tax incentives contributes to the activation of investments, consumption, employment and the economy in general, generating greater wealth and, therefore, a greater base on which to collect taxes. This is the trend most of the European countries around us are following, leaving for a later phase of economic recovery, possible tax increases."

We are asking the government to appeal this tax directly, but in any case, we are going to appeal the settlements that have started to be applicable. The taxes in force as seen July 1, 2020, and will have an impact on Endesa of \u20ac56 million, of which \u20ac53 million in generation, mostly of it in nuclear and an additional \u20ac3 million in distribution."

So once the domestical plants Compostilla, Teruel stop their operation last June 30, we now estimate that by 2021 these 2 facilities will also be allowed to close, completing the total coal phaseout process in mainland. Regarding the dismantling cost, we are not expecting additional provision to those booked already in 2019."

I would say that negotiation with the unions have continued during in the second quarter, but no new agreements have been adopted so far apart from the one already recorded in the first quarter, although, let me comment that I think we are getting closer to a potential agreement with them. We keep on working on different efficiency improvement plans with the company to yield incremental ongoing cost savings. The net results of the provision is within the company ordinary net income based on our dividend policy. In any case, we maintained the guidance announced in our Capital Markets Day last November of \u20ac3.9 billion EBITDA and \u20ac1.7 billion net ordinary income, and this is net of the positive provision effect."

The current environment, obviously, might increase the financial M&A opportunities. And also, we\u2019ve recently seen a transaction by, for example, EDP buying the assets of ESCO. But as always, we will look at all these opportunities, given that we plan to accelerate organic and inorganic growth, but always with a very clear priority, which is strategic fit and creation of value for our shareholders. And this is on balance sheet, it provides us with the full optionality to make bolt-on investments in attractive prices if such opportunities materialize."

First one is given the effect that COVID-19 has had on first half results, could you give us a reference of the expected impact for the second half of the year? Are you in a position to confirm the guidance for 2020?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Thank you, Mar. I will try just to give the same answer that I have given before. That always is difficult, but I will try to do my best. Well, what we think is that the second quarter accumulates the majority of the COVID-19 impact as the lockdown in Spain was extended from March 14 to June 21. In this regard, the impact on Endesa has been, let\u2019s say, relatively limited, thanks to the resilience of our integrated business model and the very low exposure to the regulated business to COVID.",
            "As of June 30, we paid an estimated net impact as Luca has said of \u20ac80 million of EBITDA level mainly due to the scenario of demand decline, both in the liberalized business and in non-mainland business, which was partially offset by the positive management of the short position. In absence of the estimated COVID impact, our like-for-like EBITDA, as again, Endesa has said \u2013 Luca has said, we have shown an 8% increase, reaching \u20ac2,039 million.",
            "Although it is very difficult to estimate the future of COVID-19 impact, economy should stabilize, allowing for more normalized second semester. Indeed, second quarter, should be the most effective quarter, implying that the negative book in the first half are not expected to increase significantly. In any case, the good operating results accumulated by Endesa so far will allow us to fulfill the committed guidance of the year, net of the effect of the provision release that is \u20ac3.9 billion at EBITDA level and \u20ac1.7 billion and net ordinary income level.",
            "In addition, I would like to say that Endesa\u2019s strong balance sheet with low leverage and robust liquidity standing out 23 months and reinforce with the last agreement signed, implies a very wide margin of safety."

            "Thank you again, Mar. As commented on in the presentation and in the previous \u2013 the previous means in the first question, the first time that you actually raised this question, our price-driven production for 2021 is 92% hedged, at still high OTC references, and the integrated revenue is expected to convert to a similar integrated revenue level of 2020 that is something around \u20ac62 per megawatt hour.",
            "Similar to what we discussed in the first quarter, we believe our forward prices for 2021 and 2022 remain contaminated by the current scenario of weak demand and commodity prices. OTCs for 2021 are currently trading at \u20ac44, \u20ac45 and at \u20ac45, \u20ac46 per megawatt hour for 2022, getting closer now to the \u20ac48 per megawatt hour at which they were trading at the end of the year 2019. These prices still trigger negative clean spark spread, which is not realistic being the combined cycles, the price setting technology in Spain. This make us believe that this situation and that these forward references should keep on improving."
