      "Howard Lorber": [
         "Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Vector Group\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me today are Nick Anson, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Liggett Vector Brands; and Bryant Kirkland, Vector Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Ron Bernstein, Senior Advisor to Liggett Vector Brands, will join us during the Q&A.",
         "Before discussing our second quarter results, I would like to acknowledge the social change underway in the United States. Like many other companies, we are operating in the context of important and long overdue changes. Recent events have demonstrated that systemic racism and social injustice continue to exist today. We all have significant work ahead of us, as meaningful actions bring meaningful change. We will hold ourselves accountable, and accountability is a priority for our company.",
         "Now, to our second quarter results. During this call, I will first review our consolidated financial results and then discuss Douglas Elliman\u2019s financial performance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. Nick will then summarize the performance of the tobacco business. And I will then provide closing comments, and afterwards, we will open the call for questions.",
         "As of June 30, 2020, Vector Group maintained significant liquidity with cash and cash equivalents of $540 million, including cash of $61 million at Douglas Elliman and $218 million at Liggett, and investment securities and investment partnerships with a fair market value of $137 million.",
         "The cash balances at Liggett include $132 million of deferred federal excise tax payments, which will be paid in the third quarter. During the second quarter, our liquidity increased by $53 million from the issuance of 5 million shares of common stock. We will be strategic with our liquidity and believe the current economic environment will present opportunities for investments yielding above-market returns.",
         "Now, turning to Vector Group\u2019s operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. Vector Group\u2019s revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2020 were $445.8 million compared to $534.8 million in the 2019 period. Our tobacco segment reported an increase of $18 million in revenues due to price increases and increased unit volume.",
         "However, our real estate segment reported a significant decline in revenues due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an unusual year-over-year comparison because of the acceleration of real estate closings in New York City in the 2019 second quarter. This acceleration occurred in anticipation of the increase in New York State Mansion Tax on residential real estate on July 1, 2019.",
         "Net income attributed to Vector Group for the second quarter of 2020 was $25.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to net income of $39.3 million or $0.25 per diluted common share in the second quarter of 2019. The company recorded adjusted EBITDA of $76.5 million compared to $83.5 million in the prior year. Adjusted net income was $28.7 million or $0.19 per share diluted compared to $43.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the 2019 period. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, Vector Group\u2019s revenues were $900.2 million compared to $959.4 million in the 2019 period. Our tobacco segment reported an increase of $48.3 million in revenues. This contrasted with a decline in revenues in our real estate segment.",
         "Net income attributed to Vector Group for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $22.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared to net income of $54.3 million or $0.33 per diluted common share for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The company recorded adjusted EBITDA of $136.7 million compared to $133.2 million in the prior year. Adjusted net income was $68.6 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $56.1 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the 2019 period.",
         "Douglas Elliman\u2019s results for the three months ended June 30, 2020: Douglas Elliman reported $132.9 million in revenues, a net loss of $5 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.1 million compared to 400 \u2013 excuse me, compared to $243 million in revenues, net income of $15.1 million and adjusted EBITDA of $16.6 million in the second quarter of 2019.",
         "For the six months ended June 30, 2020, Douglas Elliman reported $298.5 million in revenues, a net loss of $74.1 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $8.8 million compared to $404.8 million in revenues, net income of $4.7 million and adjusted EBITDA of $7.7 million in the first six months of 2019. Douglas Elliman\u2019s net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2020 included pre-tax and non-cash impairment charges of $58.3 million and pre-tax restructuring charges of $3 million.",
         "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a profound effect on the economy in response to the pandemic, state and local governments instituted restrictions on individuals and on the type of business that can operate, which directly impacted Douglas Elliman\u2019s and others\u2019 ability to do business in New York and its other markets. As a result, in the second quarter of 2020, Douglas Elliman\u2019s revenues in the New York metropolitan area declined by 52% from the second quarter of 2019.",
         "To address the impact of COVID-19, Douglas Elliman implemented a reduction of personnel by 25% in April 2020 and began consolidating offices and reducing other administrative expenses. These expense reduction initiatives resulted in a decline in Douglas Elliman\u2019s second quarter 2020 operating and administrative expenses by approximately $20 million from the second quarter in 2019. Third quarter cash receipts to date have shown improvement from the second quarter in all markets. We believe the changes implemented at Douglas Elliman will provide long-term upside to the stockholders of Vector Group.",
         "Now, I will turn the call over to Nick to discuss our tobacco business. Nick?",
         "Thank you, Nick. Vector Group has strong cash reserves, has consistently increased its tobacco unit volume and profits, and has taken the necessary steps to position its real estate business for future success. We are pleased with our long-standing history of paying a quarterly cash dividend. It remains an important component of our capital allocation strategy. While we continue to evaluate our dividend policy each quarter, it is our expectation that the policy will continue well into the future.",
         "Now, operator, please open the call for questions."
      ],
      "Nick Anson": [
         "Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone. As Howard mentioned, Liggett performed exceptionally well in the second quarter despite the continued impact on the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic. Year-over-year volume and market share increased during the second quarter, contributing to a 14.5% increase in tobacco adjusted operating income.",
         "As I mentioned during our previous earnings call, we made various adjustments during the first quarter to address the health and safety of our employees and those with whom we do business. These changes will remain in place throughout the second quarter. I\u2019m pleased to report our tobacco business operations remain largely unaffected by the pandemic.",
         "As the pandemic unfolded in March, there were some anticipatory wholesale, retail and consumer buying related to early concerns of the ongoing availability of cigarettes. Those concerns proved to be unfounded, and we continued to ship product as usual throughout the second quarter. The entire supply chain has operated normally to this point. And importantly, our underlying year-over-year retail sales trends are strong.",
         "As noted on previous calls, we are well into the income growth phase of our Eagle 20\u2019s business strategy, and I\u2019m very pleased with the results we have achieved so far. We began increasing prices on Eagle 20\u2019s in late 2018 and have grown volume, share and profit since then. Our market programs and promotions have proven successful, and we remain optimistic about Eagle 20\u2019s continued growth going forward.",
         "I will now turn to the combined tobacco financials for Liggett Group and Vector Tobacco. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, Liggett revenues were $312.5 million and $599.6 million respectively, compared to $294.5 million and $551.3 million for the corresponding 2019 periods.",
         "Tobacco operating income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was $79.3 million and $148.5 million respectively, compared to $68.7 million and $128.8 million respectively. Tobacco adjusted operating income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was $79.4 million and $148.5 million respectively, compared to $69.3 million and $129.5 million for the corresponding periods a year ago. Liggett\u2019s higher year-over-year earnings resulted primarily from increased unit volumes and higher net pricing.",
         "According to Management Science Associates, overall industry wholesale shipments for the second quarter were down 4.5%, while Liggett\u2019s wholesale shipments increased 1% versus the prior year quarter. As we regularly note, we believe retail shipments are a better indicator of industry trends than wholesale shipments, as various actions by manufacturers and wholesalers can impact trade volumes.",
         "These effects are typically less pronounced with retail shipments. For the second quarter, Liggett\u2019s retail shipments increased 0.2% over the prior year quarter, while industry retail shipments decreased 2.2% during the same period. Liggett\u2019s retail share for the second quarter increased 11 basis points to 4.3%.",
         "Eagle 20\u2019s retail volume for the second quarter grew by nearly 7% compared to the prior year period, and it remains the third largest discount brand in the U.S. Eagle 20\u2019s is now sold in approximately 78,000 stores nationwide, and its growth continues to provide an effective volume and profit complement to Pyramid and other Liggett brands.",
         "Despite managed and anticipated volume declines, we remain pleased with the performance of Pyramid. The brand continues to deliver substantial profit and market presence for the company, has strong distribution and is currently sold in approximately 100,000 stores nationwide.",
         "While our second quarter 2020 results had limited impact from smaller deep discount-focused companies, this market segment remains the industry\u2019s most active. Various smaller companies create pricing pressure as they seek to undercut the market in targeted geographies. Liggett has marketplace advantages relative to these companies, including the broad base of our distribution, our consumer-focused promotional programs and the executional capabilities of our sales force.",
         "We are very pleased with our second quarter 2020 performance, particularly in light of the current macroeconomic environment. Our results continue to validate our market strategy. And as we look ahead, we remain focused on generating operating income from the strong sales and distribution base of Pyramid, while delivering volume, share and profit growth from Eagle 20\u2019s.",
         "As mentioned earlier, we have implemented workplace protocols to meet or exceed state and federal guidelines, including employee health evaluations and social distancing. We have in place protocols for rapid mitigation of any issues that may arise in connection with COVID-19 and are confident that we are well equipped to manage contingencies. Finally, while we are always subject to industry and general market risks, we remain confident that we have effective programs to keep our business operating efficiently, while supporting market share and profit growth.",
         "Thanks for your attention, and back to you, Howard."

            "Hi, great. Thank you very much. Very good results here, congratulations. Question would be on the Douglas Elliman side. Almost breakeven there, very good. Can you maybe walk us through some of the cost initiatives you\u2019ve taken? Where has been your biggest sources of cost savings? And how do we think about the profitability of the business going forward? This third quarter, you think, you\u2019ll move back into the black in that business? And just any more detail you can give us on that? Thanks."

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Well, obviously, once we had the shutdown in New York City, we took what we considered some drastic movements, which was to basically furlough employees, terminate some employees, and then also had salary reductions on remaining employees based on their level of compensation. We have now started to return some of those cuts, and we will continue as soon \u2013 as long as business continues to improve.",
            "What you\u2019re seeing, I think, really in the numbers of the small loss is based on the fact that business had picked up a little bit, but more, it was really the fact of the cuts in overhead. It\u2019s really pretty much as simple as that. What we have to hope is that the markets continue to improve. I mentioned, July started off pretty good, started off in the third quarter. It remains to be seen what happens for the rest of the quarter because we\u2019re \u2013 generally, August is a slow month, so we will see. But I think that basically, it was the cost changes that were made in the business and the consolidation of offices was also done.",
            "And I think that we\u2019re in a good position, assuming the market helps us a little bit. You need to have volume. You need to have buyers and sellers. And lots of times, when things like this happen, you have a lot of sellers but not too many buyers, and that\u2019s where we were. Hopefully, that\u2019s going to change as people come back into the market with a low interest environment for mortgages really helps.",
            "And so, I think the future looks good. Not every market will perform the same. Right now, Florida and California are doing very well. Smaller markets like Aspen, which are vacation markets usually, but there\u2019s a lot of business going on there. So we hope to continue those and hopefully see a return to better days in the New York City market."

            "Okay, thanks. And maybe building on that kind of question, again, on the New York City side, when you think about like your real estate investment portfolio, what do you think of valuations here? And maybe also, what are you thinking about just the long-term prospects of New York, New York City, in particular? Given you have a lot more work from home, you have social unrest, there\u2019s a lot kind of going on in New York City right now. How are you thinking about that? And also, are you buying, are you selling? What sort of are you thinking there? Thanks."

The brokers have just started coming back to the office, but nowhere \u2013 it\u2019s nowhere near where the amount of them coming in yet. It\u2019s a very small amount that are coming in. So we\u2019re looking very carefully, and our plan is to reduce office space where we can.",
            "As leases come up, we\u2019re pretty much inclined not to renew any leases and try to consolidate. But we have some longer-term leases that we\u2019ll have to deal with as we go forward. As it relates to the investment portfolio, we constantly look at it and we constantly have taken write-downs on some of our investments when it\u2019s appropriate.

It is still \u2013 the market is still quite strong there, especially for single-family homes, and that seems to be continuing.

We\u2019ve seen a pickup in Westchester and Long Island. So The Hamptons had a very busy season so far; percentage-wise, way up. But having said that, it\u2019s a small market.

Obviously, we\u2019re seeing the effects of changing consumption patterns, more people working from home and a stimulated economy with smokers having more disposable income.",

We\u2019ve got impacts with respect to the federal unemployment supplemental checks ending or best likely reduce. So we are anticipating that the industry volume in the back half of the year likely to come under more pressure. But with those economic pressures, we\u2019re likely to see kind of a resumption of down-trading to the discount segment. So even though there\u2019s \u2013 we anticipate being more pressure on the industry as a whole, we believe that we\u2019re well-positioned in the marketplace to take advantage of that."

There\u2019s no hard or fast rules as to when we would potentially introduce or reintroduced another one of our existing brands.

            "Well, this is surely the down circle in certain markets, for sure. And the question is how far down is it going to go. And it\u2019s a little early in my opinion. When you look at most of the asset classes that we would look at like hotels, for instance, which are way down, the problem is most of them are closed. And so do you buy them when they\u2019re close, not knowing how long this pandemic is going to continue. So, we are always looking at opportunities.",
            "We\u2019re always interested. But we\u2019re also funding a couple of \u2013 for instance, we have two hotels, both of which are closed, which we expect to open. One is in New York City. One is in West Hollywood, California. And these hotels were actually very strong in operations and they were doing very well, both of them. So we\u2019re feeding them a little bit of money right now, just on getting ready to reopen West Hollywood I think in September, we\u2019re hoping, and the City probably around the same time. So right now, we\u2019re supporting some of the assets we have that need to be supported. And we have lots of phone calls and lots of conversations about new opportunities, but nothing that we feel we\u2019re going to be doing right away."

            "Great, thank you. And then my last question on Liggett. We\u2019ve been tracking an increase in miles driven, but gas price is a little bit higher. And then this stimulus check for the $600 unemployment may or may not continue. And I heard your comments on the back half volume potentially being down, but maybe the trade down from project brands to value. I guess how are you guys thinking about where volumes would go in the second half or \u2013 and/or like how much risk do you think you have in that kind of environment?"

I think obviously, we\u2019ve been operating in a stimulated economy for the second quarter. And undoubtedly, if those federal unemployment checks go away, the average smoker is going to be under pressure. But again, we believe based on that, we will likely see some additional down-trading, for the second quarter, actually, sequentially, second quarter over the first quarter, the industry segments were relatively stable and there wasn\u2019t a significant movement to discount. But we believe when that \u2013 we believe in the back half of the year, if those economic pressures continue, we likely to see that down-trading continue. And again, we feel based on our brands\u2019 position in the marketplace, I\u2019ll focus on value. We\u2019re well-positioned to take advantage of that."
