         "Thanks, Carol and good morning. Today, I will discuss our quarterly performance and current trends in our business, which the teams are navigating well. Before I start, I want to point out the expanded disclosure in our web schedules. To improve transparency, we brought the 10-Q balance sheet and cash flow statements forward and have included them in the materials released today. Through the second quarter, we face challenges from the coronavirus pandemic and resulting recession. Global real GDP and global industrial production are estimated to be down 9.3% and 14.6% respectively. And in the U.S., real GDP and industrial production declined with unemployment reaching historic highs. In response, we adjusted our network to support our customers\u2019 needs. We manage costs and leaned into three significant changes in demand in the markets we serve.",
         "First, our ability to shift air capacity to where it was needed enabled us to meet the strong demand out of Asia, using both our own assets and asset-light solutions. We met the demand for more capacity by flying about 635 extra flights using both brown tail and third-party aircraft. Next during the quarter, the U.S. e-commerce market jumped 34.4% and SMB is quickly adapted to participate. In fact, through our digital access program, we captured 120,000 new customer accounts, a significant increase from recent trends.",
         "And finally, our healthcare expertise and global portfolio of services enabled us to meet the urgent need for PPE and COVID-19 testing supplies, and provide support for vaccine and treatment studies. All of which, contributed to our results in each of our three segments. For the quarter, consolidated revenue increased 13.4% to $20.5 billion. Net income rose 8.8% to $1.9 billion and operating profit totaled $2.3 billion or 7.4% higher than last year. The operating margin for the company was 11.4% below last year by 60 basis points, diluted earnings per share was $2.13, up 8.7% from the same period last year.",
         "Now moving into the segments. In U.S. Domestic, market demand for residential delivery surged in the quarter, driving total average daily volume up to 21.1 million packages, an increase of 22.8%. SurePost increased 96.6% and represented 53% of our total U.S. Domestic volume growth. Volume approached peak like levels with May and June, significantly above April. The surge created some network constraints and some regional dips in service levels. However, the additional 39,000 employees, we hired together with our expanded weekend operations enabled us to process the increase in volume.",
         "Ground residential volume, excluding SurePost was up 63.8%, without exception, all industry sectors grew the residential volume. In fact, B2C volume jumped 65.2% year-over-year, which is 5.8 million additional pieces per day, and B2C represented 69% of total volume. Conversely, given the downturn in the industrial sector, B2B volume declined 21.9% or 1.8 million pieces per day from the same period last year. However, we did see B2B volume begin to recover in the quarter. As a percentage of total volume, B2B shipments were 27% in early May. And at the end of the quarter, B2B shipments had climbed to 37% of total U.S. volume. For some context, the full year 2019 split was 46% B2B. While average daily volume growth was led by many of our larger customers, SMBs rebounded over the quarter, from a decline of 7.2% in April to growth of 17.8% in May and 22.4% in June.",
         "Revenue was up 17.3% to $13 billion, driven primarily by ground products. Revenue per piece declined 4.4% or 440 basis points, driven by two significant factors, lower fuel prices, which were a negative impact of 180 basis points, and the magnitude of SurePost growth pulled revenue per piece down 410 basis points. Excluding SurePost and the fuel surcharge, revenue per piece was higher than last year, and was also a sequential improvement from the first quarter.",
         "Our expenses increased in the quarter by 19.5% and we\u2019re in line with activity levels, including volume growth. Our expenses also includes several items that we did not have last year, which I\u2019ll cover in a moment. Cost per piece was down 2.7% year-over-year and decreased sequentially 8.4%, driven by lower fuel costs and our ability to scale and flex the network as volume surged. The U.S. generated $1.2 billion in operating profit, which was $11 million or 0.9% below last year. Operating margin declined 170 basis points year-over-year. However, sequential margins improved 580 basis points.",
         "U.S. Domestic operating profit includes the following expense items, coronavirus direct expenses, minus the CARES Act, federal excise tax benefit lowered profit by $44 million. A lower pension discount rate decreased profit by $63 million. Additional employee incentives reduced profit by $51 million, and working in our favor were lower fuel cost for a net fuel benefit of $61 million. We are operating in a very difficult environment and we have more work ahead of us to increase profit per piece, which was down 19.3% on a year-over-year basis. Moving forward, our focus is on improving network efficiency, optimizing the volume we bring in and better aligning pricing with the value we provide.",
         "Moving to International, I\u2019d like to take a moment to congratulate our entire international team for delivering a very strong quarter, despite a tough operating environment. Our performance demonstrates the agility of our global integrated network. Asia was the first region to face the pandemic and was also the first to reopen, which led to a strong increase in export volume and revenue as we came out of the first quarter. Asia outbound volume rose in April, peaked in May, and moderated in June. Overall, Asia outbound volume grew 46.8% in the quarter and went up by double digits to all major regions of the world.",
         "Total export volume grew 11.4% driven by two factors. First, we quickly leaned into the opportunity created by the reduction of passenger belly space. We also added capacity surcharges to help us manage demand. In total, we added 335 flights and utilized our higher capacity fleet of 747 aircrafts, which enabled us to handle more volume on fewer flights versus other carriers in the market. The second factor was the 95% increase in residential volume, led by cross border B2C in Europe, doubling our B2C volume, while expanding profits is an encouraging sign for the future.",
         "Revenue rose 5.7% to $3.7 billion. Revenue per piece was down 3.9% and included a decline of 480 basis points from fuel, and 100 basis points from currency. On the expense side, cost per piece declined 8.2%, primarily due to lower fuel costs and greater network efficiencies. International generated operating profit of $842 million, an increase of 26.6%, and our operating margin expanded 370 basis points.",
         "Looking at Supply Chain and Freight, results across the business units were mixed. Total revenue grew 8.5% to $3.7 billion, and expense rose 9.4% to $3.4 billion. Profit declined $6 million or 2.2%. In general, the parts of our business that aligned to sectors with elevated demand did very well. For example, air freight led the segment due to the surge in market rates out of Asia, sparked by the sharp decline in passenger belly space. The team was responsive to our customer\u2019s needs, including FEMA and resourceful in securing about 300 charters out of Asia.",
         "We also saw gains from COVID testing in vaccine and treatment studies. The portions of the Supply Chain and Freight segment, more aligned to industrial activity saw weakness during the quarter. LTL and truckload brokerage faced excess capacity and reduce demand early in the quarter. Both markets began to see some recovery later in the quarter, but remain under pressure.",
         "Looking at the overall enterprise, UPS generated operating profit of $2.3 billion up 7.4%. A few other items on the income statement include, other pension income, which was $327 million driven by last year 17.5% return on pension assets and lower discount rates. We also had $183 million of interest expense. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 25% compared to 23.5% in the second quarter of last year and is higher mainly due to unfavorable changes in our uncertain tax positions.",
         "Now let\u2019s turn to cash and shareholder returns. Our cash flow remains strong. For the first six months of the year, we generated $5.9 billion in cash from operations, and about $3.9 billion in free cash flow, included in our results is $370 million from the federal payroll tax deferral. Capital investments totaled $2.1 billion in the first half of the year. We expect full year CapEx of $5.6 billion and remain on track with our automation targets for this year. So far this year, UPS has distributed $1.8 billion in dividends, which represents a 5.2% increase on a per share basis over the same period last year.",
         "Now I\u2019ll make a few comments regarding the back half of the year. First, we remain unable to predict the extent of the business impact or the duration of the coronavirus pandemic or reasonably estimate UPS 2020 revenue and diluted earnings per share. There are however, a few items that are likely to occur in the second half of the year that we want you to know about. U.S. Domestic average daily volume growth is expected to be lower than what we saw in the second quarter. We expect demand for residential packages will continue in the U.S. and around the world. We also expect Asia outbound demand and yields to be positive year-over-year, but we\u2019ll continue to moderate versus the second quarter.",
         "For modeling purposes, our Teamster employees will get their annual wage increase in August. And in the third quarter of 2019, we had a $40 million gain on a land sale in the international segment that will not repeat. And in the second half of 2020, U.S. Domestic will face difficult year-over-year comps, including the impact of our new hires anticipated to receive full benefits, time and transit, and weekend operations expense, preceding the full run rate of revenue, and other gains from last year that will not repeat.",
         "The economic recovery remains uncertain. We are paying close attention to the consumer financial health, unemployment levels and the continuation of fiscal stimulus programs. Given all these factors, the U.S. Domestic margin could be lower in the second half of the year, relative to the first half. International, Supply Chain and Freight will continue to adapt to market dynamics. Meanwhile, as Carol said, we will focus on controlling what we control. Among the positive and negative effects ahead of us, we remain confident in our ability to improve U.S. margins on a long-term basis. Our liquidity is very strong. We ended the quarter with more than $8 billion in cash and equivalence on the balance sheet, which is enabling us to invest through this unique environment and navigate the economic uncertainty.",
         "Thank you. And operator, please open the lines."
      ],
      "Carol Tom\u00e9": [
         "Thank you, Scott and good morning. I\u2019m honored to be hosting my first UPS earnings call. Before I begin, I would like to thank David Abney, who after 46 years of service to UPS passed the baton to me on June 1. We wish David all the best.",
         "UPS is a special company with a unique culture powered by more than 528,000 UPSers around the world. Through this time of global pandemic and social unrest, UPS is keeping the world moving. We have taken measures to ensure the safety of our people, while delivering critical shipments and everyday essential, where and when they are needed. I am extremely proud of the efforts of our people to serve our customers, our communities, and each other. To all UPSers, thank you.",
         "During the quarter, our team did a great job adjusting the network to respond to the needs of our customers. At the beginning of the second quarter, we assumed demand would slow. Instead, we saw just the opposite. Due to ongoing COVID-related sheltering in place, retail store closures and changes in U.S. consumer spending fueled by the economic stimulus, we experienced unprecedented demand and record high volume levels. As a result, our second quarter performance was stronger than we expected.",
         "Consolidated revenue rose 13.4% from last year to $20.5 billion. Operating profit grew 7.4% from last year to $2.3 billion, led by outstanding results in the international segment, while our U.S. operating margin declined by 170 basis points from last year, largely due to certain expense items that Brian will explain. We were pleased with 580 basis points of sequential improvement from what we reported in the first quarter.",
         "Let me share with you how I\u2019ve been spending my time since onboarding as CEO. I thought, I knew UPS after 17 years on the board, but I\u2019ve been diving in and believe me, when you get to dive deeper, this company is even more impressive than I imagined. Our global network is best-in-class and our people are the hardest working people I\u2019ve ever met. We also have many opportunities. In our 113 year history, UPS has become a trusted global logistics leader. But what got us where we are today will not get us to where we need to go in the future. Our customers are changing, our competitors are changing and the rate of change is accelerating.",
         "As we evaluate new market realities, we will be making decisions faster based on data and analytics with an emphasis on optimizing our existing network and the investments we\u2019ve made. We will have a laser focus on creating value for our shareowners, with the goal of increasing the rates of return on the capital we invest. It\u2019s all about becoming better, not bigger.",
         "We have five core UPS principles that underpin our actions. Our first principle is our values. These values were established by our Founder, Jim Casey, and give us an enduring foundation for success. Our values include integrity, safety, teamwork and service, and are the core of who we are and what we do. Our second principle is our dividend, which is a hallmark of our financial strength. We are committed to continuing nearly 50 years of stability and growth in the dividends we pay.",
         "Our third guiding principle is retaining a strong investment grade credit rating, ensuring that we have financial flexibility needed to competitively run our business. Next is brand relevance. And by relevance, we mean leading by example, taking actions to support our customers and communities, promote diversity and inclusion, sponsor racial equality and shape a healthier planet. And finally, our fifth principle is the importance of employee ownership, which supports valuable and lasting employee and retiree engagement.",
         "Outside of these five core principles, everything else in our portfolio is under review, and I mean everything. While it is early in the process, the good news is that we already have the right strategy in place. Customer first, people led, innovation driven. Customer first is about removing friction when doing business with UPS. Speeding up time and transit and improving the moments that matter. So we create greater loyalty to be measured by gains and our net promoter score. In support of this effort, we have accelerated our plans to improve time and transit, making the U.S. ground networks faster and thousands of the most important lanes by the end of this year. Further, we are continuing our expansion of weekend operations, including Sunday share post and our market leading Saturday commercial delivery and pickup services.",
         "Before our 2020 peak season, nearly 75% of the U.S. population will get Saturday ground residential service. By our estimate, both our time and transit and weekend enhancements drove roughly $100 million of incremental revenue in the second quarter. People led is at the core of our success, measure it through the employee experience and specifically how likely an employee is to recommend UPS as a place to work. We are focused on diversity and inclusion and fighting for racial justice and reform. I cannot say enough about the power of our people, including the nearly 40,000 new UPSers, we\u2019ve added to our U.S. Small Package business in recent months. During this time, we\u2019ve provided additional sick leave benefits to UPSers who may have been impacted by COVID-19. And to further invest in our full time management teams for their extraordinary efforts, we are providing additional financial incentives.",
         "Moving to the last leg of our strategic platform. Innovation driven will be measured by the value we create for our shareowners. We will leverage our technology and portfolio of services to drive greater cash generation and higher returns on invested capital. Today, we are focused on increasing network efficiency, as well as more permanent actions to improve revenue quality, including pricing that reflects the value we create. For example, on May 31, we introduced new surcharges of certain volumes. We are developing specific actions and metrics against our strategic efforts. And once finalized, we\u2019ll share them with you, so that you can measure our progress.",
         "Looking to the back half of the year. Most scenarios suggest continued uncertainty, which is likely to yield a more gradual economic recovery. This is due in part to the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, new containment measures and the status of fiscal stimulus program. While we would expect continued strong B2C demand, it\u2019s hard to know how our B2B demand will unfold. The recovery will continue to be extremely difficult to predict until the spread of the virus is better controlled and a vaccine is widely available.",
         "I\u2019ve led through difficult economic cycles before, and I know the power of making the right decisions to pivot toward opportunity. Our leadership team is focused on enabling success for all UPSers and creating value for our shareowners. We will control what we can control, while taking action to write the next chapter of the UPS story. We look forward to updating you on our progress.",
         "And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian."

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2019 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Q\u2019s and other reports we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.",
         "During the quarter, GAAP results included a pretax charge of $112 million, equivalent to $0.10 on an earnings per share. The charge resulted from transformation-related activities in the international and U.S. domestic segments. In the prior year period, GAAP results included a pretax charge for transformation cost of $21 million, equivalent to $0.02 on an earnings per share. Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude transformation costs.",

What are you thinking about it from a network investment standpoint, any bottlenecks that may emerge there?"

I participated in my first peak planning committee several weeks after I joined the company and very impressed by how we are planning to manage through, what could be a very peaky season, is about making sure that we\u2019ve got our network aligned both on the high end and on the low end, because it\u2019s uncertain out there. So we\u2019re building an optionality, in terms of how we\u2019re going to run the network. And then Kate with her team are talking to our customers customer-by-customer and how we will best manage through peak."

            "Hey, thanks and congrats, Carol. So first, if you can just clarify that the second half margin comment is that lower than the second quarter or lower than the full first half. And then just Carol, just bigger picture, I wanted to just get your perspective on how you\u2019re thinking about the growth algorithm for UPS in the U.S. business. So the last few years, it\u2019s been volume outpacing revenue and margins falling. Do you think we see more or less volume growth going forward than what we\u2019ve seen? You\u2019ve historically talked about 2% to 3% price. Does that meaningfully change? And then I guess, do you think you can \u2013 when do you think you can get back to a double digit margin? I know there\u2019s lot there, but any perspective would be great. Thank you."
         ],

      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Absolutely happy to share some perspective. As Brian said, it\u2019s \u2013 our operating margin in the U.S. domestic business could be lower in the back half of the year than what we reported in the first half of the year. Lot of uncertainty in the marketplace, of course, but we thought it was helpful for Brian to kick out some of the expense related items that we\u2019re pretty sure will happen, because we\u2019re not terribly sure about the demand side. Now longer term, this is where we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re going to do with our company. In my prepared remarks, I\u2019ve talked about, it\u2019s all about being better, not bigger. What do I mean by that? Well, just a couple of things. This may be a longer-winded answer then you\u2019re looking for. But I\u2019ll go ahead and take the opportunity to share with you, what I mean by that and what we mean by that.",
            "First, we are an engineering-driven company, you would expect us to be. But like any company who was 113 years old, we\u2019ve over engineered much of what we\u2019ve done. And I\u2019ll give you an example of that, depending on how you define products, we have between 400 and 500 products. We kicked off a task force to say, really, are we selling all of those products? Because when you think about it, if you have between 400 and 500 products, you have to build systems and technology to support those products, you have to build accountants to account for those products. You have to have auditors who audit for those products. And then you have to have salespeople who sell those products. As we looked at it, and it\u2019s very early days, we found that last year, there were over 100 of those products that we didn\u2019t even sell. So we\u2019re going to rationalize our product offering to make it simpler for our customers and reduce expense here.",
            "As we think about optimizing the network to your specific question on volume, it\u2019s about being better, not bigger. What we have done in the past is built capacity or bought capacity, and the hope that demand would follow. And we would take demand at any cost or any price, if you will. Not necessarily nutritive demand. So let me give you an example of a change, that we\u2019ve just launched this year. We love our air fleet and in fact, about 11% of our air fleet are wide-body planes, these are 747 planes. And we took advantage of those wide bodies in the second quarter. We were able to fly demand out of Asia at a very effective cost, because they\u2019re wide bodies. We didn\u2019t have to fly as many planes. So we had an opportunity to buy more of those 747s because they\u2019re coming up production.",
            "And the question that we asked ourselves is, well, won\u2019t that create excess capacity? And won\u2019t we find that we\u2019ll need to fill that capacity at perhaps non-nutritive ways. And the answer to that question was, yes. So we passed on that investment that in the past we might have made. So we\u2019re going to really look to sweat the assets that we have to get more off of that investment that we\u2019ve made over time. We will look to pivot the customer and the way we go-to-market to optimize the network. And I hope that answers your question."

So lots of revenue, lots of demand, as it stands right now. Is there a clear path and maybe the next couple of quarters, maybe not necessarily the third quarter, this heap profit growth in the context of the revenue growth that we\u2019re seeing, because the revenue is obviously spectacular in the second quarter on the domestic side, we actually saw profits down a little bit? So just want to kind of get a sense of what are the sort of steps that you need to take to be able to get that profit, to grow in line with revenue or at least closer."

      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. The easy way to think about profit growth is of course with pricing increases. And as you know, we did take some short surcharge increases at the end of May, but it\u2019s much more than pricing. It\u2019s really about optimizing the network and leaning into the customer segments that value the end-to-end network that we offer. And one of those segments is small and medium-sized businesses. And you heard Brian talk about the growth that we saw in that space in the second quarter up 11%. As I look at our small and medium-size customer base, we divide it into four big segments D1 through D4, that\u2019s based on customer size. D1 and D2 customer segments, we\u2019ve got pretty good market share there. But in D3 and D4, we\u2019re underpenetrated relative to our competitors. We have an opportunity to grow into that space, but we need some enabling capabilities.",
            "The number one enabling capability to grow into that space is time and transit. So when I came onto the company and I looked at our time and transit activities we used to call that Panthera. We now called our fastest time \u2013 our Fastest Ground Ever. I saw that, we were planning to conclude that investment in June of 2021. I asked the team, well, what\u2019s getting in the way. What\u2019s getting in the way of going faster and they said money, I\u2019m like, well, we\u2019ve got money. So we\u2019ll accelerate the investment. We pull that investment into 2020. We will complete time and transit by October of this year. And that\u2019s a big deal because 46% of our SMB customers or potential customers tell us, time and transit is the number one thing on their mind. When we\u2019re done, we will be at parity or better in 20 of the 25 markets that matter in the U.S. We will reach 90% of the U.S. population in three days, 75% of the U.S. population will have Saturday delivery. And then of course, we have Sunday delivery through our SurePost product. This matters.",
            "And why am I focusing on SMB? Because the SMB customer values are end-to-end network and they pay us for it. As we think about leaning into SMBs, it\u2019s not just about time and transit, however. It\u2019s also about a better customer experience. This goes back to being better, not bigger. We had a couple of pilots that we launched to really understand that customer and what their wants, needs and desires were. We listened to them. We operationalized what they wanted. And in the pilots, we saw 2 percentage point reduction in churn. Now that matters because in this segment, for every reduction in churn, it\u2019s $170 million in revenue. And that revenue is a much better quality than other revenue.",
            "So as we think about moving the U.S. operating margin up, there\u2019s a real opportunity to lean into a different customer segment and to make sure that we\u2019re getting value for the services we provide. That\u2019s on the revenue side. But I must talk about the cost side too, for a moment, because we have opportunities there as well. We\u2019ve talked to you in the past about Transformation 1.0. And we\u2019re well down the path of Transformation 1.0. And in fact, if you look at it life to date, on a net basis after investing, we have delivered over $1 billion of savings in Transformation 1.0. That\u2019s on a cumulative basis. If you tax effects that and use the outstanding shares, it\u2019s about $0.95 of EPS on a cumulative basis. We\u2019re not done. Productivity and efficiency must be the hallmark of UPS. So we have initial plans for Transformation 2.0 and 3.0, which when they are finalized, we will share those with you.",
            "We also are using technology to drive productivity and efficiency in our operations. And I can just give you a comment on how we\u2019re seeing that perform. We\u2019ve talked to you in the past about ORION. We have ORION 3.0 out. We\u2019re seeing a reduction in the miles that our drivers are driving and a reduction in the per piece cost. Now this is virtuous, it\u2019s continuous, but the combination of rightsizing the revenue and driving productivity and efficiency gives us a path to drive operating margin expansion in the U.S. This is a big company to turn. You can\u2019t do it overnight, but if you look through 2020 into 2021 and beyond, you should expect the margin to start to go in the right direction."

They lost 25% of the top line during that recession. Two key learnings during that time. One, invest through the crisis. No better opportunity, if you have the financial wherewithal to do so, to invest through the crisis. So that when things settle down, you are positioned to take share. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with time and transit. Our time and transit investment this year is $750 million. We could have canceled that. But we said, no, we\u2019re going to pull that board. And we\u2019re going to invest through the crisis. My second learning is to invest in your people. Now it doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have a fewer people in a downturn, but for those people that you have, you need to invest in.",
            "And if you looked at our population of UPSers, actually we\u2019re down in Supply Chain and Freight, as you would expect, because the demand softened up there. But for the people who are left behind, we are investing in them, because it creates loyalty and better experience and better service for our customers. So we\u2019re investing in incentives for our people. We\u2019ve been promoting people. It pays huge dividends if you stay true to your people. Those are very good learnings in a downturn. Learnings as a retailer, is that when cost increases come your way, if you are a large retailer, you can pass those costs increases across the SKU base, and the customers don\u2019t know. So while retailers may squawk at price increases that come their way, large retailers have a way to spread that across. And nobody knows. So there\u2019s an opportunity here on the pricing side to do what we need to do.",
            "From a customer concentration perspective, I looked at our top 20 customers and their performance in the second quarter and of those top 20 customers, all but one group, the only one that didn\u2019t grow was government. And I can\u2019t tell you why, but it didn\u2019t grow. But if I look at our top 20 customers who are retailers, who were predominantly store-based retailers, who when their stores closed and demand shifted online, well for those customers, they had triple-digit growth in the second quarter. Our largest customer did not have triple-digit growth. So that gives you some perspective on how we manage through customer concentration and how we\u2019re thinking about optimizing the portfolio long-term."

It was still down overall. But April, May, June, as it progressed, we started the quarter down 38%. Got a little better down 20%, finished June at down 8% in terms of how we\u2019re seeing it play out in this next quarter that we\u2019re holding at about the June levels down, 9-ish in the month of July, as we think about the B2B business. So SMBs, which we\u2019re also very focused on, they were up 11% in the quarter.

With this type of volume, essentially at the same holiday peak because a couple of years ago, how close is the U.S. network to maxing out capacity? I know you said, you expect volumes to moderate a bit in the back half of the year. But can you focus on revenue quality to help some of that moderation?

As a former retailer, I know this very well, how to manage through, when you have promotions, how long you have promotions, how you use your store base, how you use our access points. Don\u2019t forget that we have over 15,000 access points that we can be used to address the capacity issues. So we are feeling very good about peak this year.

We have reinvested a good piece of that. On a net basis $1.1 billion in savings and tax effected, it\u2019s about $0.95 of EPS on a cumulative basis. That\u2019s not enough, candidly. It\u2019s great. Take credit for that. It\u2019s not enough. We have initiatives underway, we\u2019re calling it, Transformation 2.0 and 3.0 to drive continued productivity and efficiency in our company.",

And that resulted in a lot of overhead doing a lot of reports, looking through the rear view mirror to drive the company. We\u2019re moving to analytical decisions science as Juan and his team, build out our digital factory, and that\u2019s going to free up productivity. That will absolutely free up productivity. Until this year, believe it or not, we only had two IT releases a year. We now are moving into a continuous release as we move into a more agile environment. And that\u2019s critically important in terms of taking costs out of this company.",

We now only have four applications running on our mainframes, and we\u2019re moving everything up to the cloud. We have 25 systems or applications in the cloud, another 20 in flight and more to do. This will get rid of some of the tech debt that we carry and free up expense dollars. There\u2019s a lot going on. And the ability to transform the way we run our business. The thing that I\u2019ve observed that haven\u2019t quite cracked and we\u2019re quite good at, we have absolutely no leverage in our [indiscernible] we need to drive more leverage and our payroll given it\u2019s the largest expense that we have.",

For example, I recently saw an automated label application by a robot. It was pretty cool. It\u2019s not ready for prime time, the cost curve isn\u2019t right. But it was pretty cool because the productivity of that arm was 50% higher than a human being.

And how fast can you adjust the cost structure, given the size and scope with UPS? And then also capacity and capital, it\u2019s a big focus area for you. Should we expect near-term cuts in CapEx intensity? Capital spending for UPS is, I don\u2019t need to tell.

How can we get more out of the assets that we have invested? So thank you for mentioning that, I came to UPS for a few reasons. One, because I love this company; two, because I want to make an impact on our people and three, I want to get the stock price moving. It\u2019s all about creating value for our shareholders. And you do that through effective capital allocation. It starts with how you allocate capital.",

As we\u2019ve talked this morning, I gave an example of not buying aircraft to have excess capacity, that would have been value destroying. So we opted not to make that capital investment. We will get the network righted before we think about investing more dollars in the network. That suggests lower capital intensity going forward.",

How you\u2019re going to fix the revenue? How are you going to get the cost out? I don\u2019t like anything unless it starts with a B, because it\u2019s just not worth our time. We\u2019re focusing on the wildly important here. So if it\u2019s not worth \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t start with a B, we\u2019re not doing it.

So you mentioned that at least for the near-term to mid-term you\u2019re to try to more with less at an that should translate into perhaps some lower CapEx levels. But maybe you think about longer-term and what could be the requirements of the business for that technology or for something for speeding up the network.

We\u2019re very focused on moving that in the opposite direction, moving it up. We\u2019re down in the low 20\u2019s right now. I think you\u2019re referring to the peak where we were in the high 20\u2019s. It\u2019ll take some time to get back in towards that trajectory. But there\u2019s a base level of CapEx that we\u2019re going to need to spend, call it $2.5 billion to $3 billion on maintenance and that\u2019s ongoing. But everything above that that we\u2019ve been spending on capacity and growth is getting looked at through a different lens. And Carol alluded to it, from a TSR we\u2019re very focused on the cash returns and looking at the annual payback and how long the payback is. So I think you can look for us to drive improved ROIC.

            "Hey, great. Good morning, Carol, again, congrats and welcome. And Brian, look forward to working with you both. You mentioned \u2013 just real quickly, you mentioned the weaker domestic in the second half. You mentioned some longer-term thoughts international. Did I hear you say that international will stay at these levels in the second half? I just want clarity on that. And then digging into the second half domestic margins, Brian, is that time in transit, is that \u2013 are these kind of the startup costs and that\u2019s going away? Or are you looking maybe \u2013 Carol, your thoughts on your long-term thoughts on getting back to that double digit margin or is it beyond that given these moves you\u2019re talking about?"

            "So, Ken, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll start with the domestic piece in terms of the back half. Yes, Carol alluded to the investments in time and transit, and we think that\u2019s a critical investment to continue to invest to drive the service for our customers and speed up time and transit. We\u2019ve got a handful of one-off items that I think I alluded to. There\u2019s a land sale, fuel excise tax, management incentive. Those are all laps, but they add up to a couple hundred million dollars. So it\u2019s a meaningful number. There\u2019s also a benefit catch up in terms of expense. We put on about 40,000 heads to handle the volume surge in the second quarter. So that will be coming back in terms of benefits, if you\u2019re full time, your benefits kick in at 30 days, if you\u2019re part time, it kicks in about six months. So you\u2019ll see those creep up. But that\u2019s why I provided the caution on the back half of the year. Longer-term though, I think the steps we\u2019re taking will drive the overall improvement in domestic margins.",
            "On the international side, I think you saw a large peak in the middle of the quarter coming out of Asia with the additional flights. And so I think that would moderate balance of the year. And Ken, as we\u2019ve talked before, I think the focus in international it\u2019s on EBIT dollars, because I think the team really have an opportunity to drive their share at those elevated margin levels. So margin may not stay at this level, but as you think about the future EBITDA will and there are certainly 2x the domestic margins, a very attractive growth. Carol, anything to add on domestic and international?"

And I just want to make sure we\u2019re really clear on that. I don\u2019t want to have any confusion there. And on the international side, I think our margin will be quite healthy in the back half."

And maybe e-commerce adoption in the international markets as well. To what degree is this potentially a headwind to profitability and margins internationally as we sort of look forward, as we sort of see e-commerce and B2C grow there? Or are there some differences in terms of how that market is structured or how you\u2019re network is structured that would make that not the case. Thank you."

And you\u2019ve been part of steering the board strategy to bring in some more outside perspectives and the senior management, which has certainly seemed to reach a new level, appointing you as CEO here. Can you give the investors some board level perspective on that evolution and thinking UPS is a storage strategy from promoting from within. And any thoughts on where the cultural shift that UPS has headed over the next several years with you at the helm? Thank you."

            "Yes. We\u2019re a big believer as a board and the company\u2019s culture, because we think it is a competitive point of differentiation. As the board looked at CEO succession, they came up with a qualification, if you will, of what the next CEO should possess in terms of experience, in terms of just knowledge in certain areas. And they map that up against both internal and external candidates. Obviously, I wasn\u2019t part of that, but there was a search committee that was formed and they looked at, here are the qualifications of the next CEO. And they looked at our internal team as well as external team and decided to go outside for the role. And I was delighted that they asked me to take the role. It\u2019s because of the time that we\u2019re in. As I look to the future of UPS, my goal is to get CEO succession ready candidate.",

But when it\u2019s time for me to move on, we have ready now candidates inside the company to promote. The big believer and investing in people to help them get to their highest potential, whatever it may be. So don\u2019t expect to see a big cultural shift just because I came in for this time. And I am delighted to be here. It\u2019s an awesome leadership team. They\u2019re in the room with me today, giving me support just for answering your questions. We really do appreciate all the thoughtful questions that came to Brian and me today. So thank you for that. And Scott, I\u2019ll turn it back to you."
