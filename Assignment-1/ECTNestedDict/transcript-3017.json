         "Thanks, John. I'll touch briefly on our financial results for the second quarter and then move to our balance sheet and liquidity. Before I discuss the quarter, let me just acknowledge and express my sincere gratitude to our team across accounting, asset management, finance and legal for all their efforts closing the quarter remotely during this pandemic. While at the same time we are closing a $3.2 billion transaction. We at VICI are lucky to have such a cohesive team.",
         "For the quarter total GAAP revenues in Q2 2020 increased 16.8% over Q2 2019 $257.9 million, while total cash revenues in Q2 2020 were $261 million, an increase of 19.5% over Q2 2019. The year-over-year increases were the result of adding $44.4 million of rent during the quarter from the Greektown, Hard Rock Cincinnati and the Century acquisitions which closed in 2019. And the JACK Cleveland, Thistledown acquisition and related loan which closed on January 24, 2020.",
         "AFFO was $176.3 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 12.4% over Q2 2019, while our weighted average diluted share count increased approximately 18.5% as a result of our June 2019 equity offering and settlement of the June, 2019 forward sale agreements which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet in advance of closing on our portion of the Eldorado Caesars transaction. AFFO for the quarter was also negatively impacted by approximately 23 million of negative interest expense carry related to the February bond offering for the Eldorado transaction being held in escrow for the entire quarter and approximately $3 million less in interest income on a year-over-year basis due to the decline in interest rates.",
         "Our G&A was $7.5 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2.9% for the quarter, which is in line with our full-year projections and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Our results, once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model as flow through of cash revenue to adjusted EBITDA was 99.2% for the quarter.",
         "As you may recall, beginning in January 1, 2020, we adopted CECL, Current Estimated Credit Losses a new accounting standard which requires us to estimate and record a non-cash provision or allowance for future credit losses related to all existing and any future investments in direct financing and sales type leases in similar assets. CECL is applicable to VICI as we account for our investments as finance leases, which are subject to the accounting standard as opposed to operating leases like our gaming REIT peers, which are scoped out of the standard. In the second quarter, then non-cash allowance related to CECL was a reversal of $65.3 million from the allowance for Q1 2020, which drove a $0.13 increase in net income per share.",
         "I'd like to again, make the point that this is a non-cash allowance and as such there is no impact to AFFO or AFFO per share. We continue to point investors to AFFO and AFFO per share as we believe that should be the primary metric used to evaluate our financial performance and our ability to pay dividends.",
         "Turning to our balance sheet and capital markets activities, on June 2, 2020, we settled in full the June, 2019 forward sale agreements utilizing net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion of cash onto our balance sheet. In June 19, in connection with the announcement of the pending Caesars Forum Convention Center mortgage and acquisition of the approximately 23 acres of land completed an upsize primary fall on operating of 29.9 million shares of common stock at a offering price at $22.15 per share for gross proceeds of $662.3 million through a forward sale agreement.",
         "The proceeds remain subject to settlement pursuant to the terms of the forward sale agreement. And then John had mentioned, on July 20, 2020 we closed on our portion of the Eldorado Caesars transaction adding $253 million of annual rent to our portfolio through the acquisition of three Harrah\u2019s assets and the acquisition of incremental rents from our Caesars Palace and Harrah's Las Vegas assets for total consideration of $3.2 billion in cash. We utilized the proceeds from the settlement of the June, 2019 forward sale agreements as well as the $2 billion of proceeds from the February bond offerings that were previously in escrow to fund the transaction. Following this we have approximately $400 million of cash on hand.",
         "Our total debt outstanding at quarter end was 6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.18%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.6 years and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As of June 30, our net debt-to-LTM EBITDA was approximately 3.4 times below our stated range and focus of maintaining net leverage between 5 times and 5.5 times. This does include the impact of the June 2, forward settlement and restricted cash that\u2019s set in escrow as of June 30.",
         "We currently have approximately $1.4 billion in available liquidity comprise of the approximately $400 million in cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility which is undrawn. In addition, the company has access to approximately $630 million in net proceeds from the future settlement of the 29.9 million shares that are subject to the forward sale agreement entered into on June 19.",
         "During the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.2975 per share based on the annualized dividend of $1.19 per share. Our AFFO payout ratio for the second quarter was 83%, slightly above our long-term range of 75% as a result of the June, 2019 equity offering. With that Operator, please open the line for questions."

      "Ed Pitoniak": [
         "Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Here's what remains foremost for us at this time. We continue to hope that all our stakeholders are weathering this COVID-19 crisis as best as can be. We held our last earnings call on Thursday, May 1. In my opening remarks, I focused on what because of COVID-19 we did not know with any certainty at the time; we did not know when our assets would reopen, what the recovery pace of our tenants\u2019 businesses would be; when exactly our $3.2 billion transaction with Eldorado Caesars would close; finally, when VICI would be able to return to an offensive portfolio growth strategy.",
         "Here today, July 30, we now know four key facts. Number one, virtually all of our assets have reopened. Number two, our operators have seen strong operating recovery at our regional assets, and through the end of June, we're seeing improving results at our two Las Vegas assets. Number three, the Eldorado-Caesars merger closed in July 20 and our $3.2 billion portion of that overall transaction will produce annual incremental rent of $253 million at a 7.8% cap rate, while also replenishing VICI's embedded growth pipeline.",
         "Number four, we returned to offence and continued our opportunistic growth on June 15 when we announced our intention to provide a $400 million mortgage loan on the brand new Caesars Forum Convention Center and purchased 23 more acres of strip proximate land, giving us a total land assemblage of 50 strip proximate acres, giving VICI the only large scale opportunity to deepen the Las Vegas strip at its center and to participate in the potential for long-term growth that this land represents. It all added up to another quarter that validated VICI\u2019s business model and generated market leading growth.",
         "For second quarter 2020, and in July, VICI collected 100% of cash rent from all of our tenants, which very few American REITs were able to do in Q2. This contributed to VICI achieving 20.4% growth and adjusted EBITDA year-over-year, which we believe will be among the various \u2013 very highest EBITDA growth rate among all American REITs for the quarter. In a moment, John Payne will discuss our operators performance and the benefits of the Caesars merger in more depth, and David Kieske will give you details about our own financial performance. But let me take a moment to speak of the root causes of our Q2 2020 performance.",
         "We believe VICI was able to continue collecting 100% of rent, delivered 20.4% EBITDA growth and opportunistically go back on offense in Q2 2020 because fundamentally we have high quality tenants. For any rent collecting multi-tenanted REIT, the strength of the REIT\u2019s business model is the aggregated strength of its tenants\u2019 business models. All of our tenants at this time are gaming operators. And during Q2, gaming operators generally, and our five gaming operators specifically, mainly Caesars, Penn National, Hard Rock, Century Casinos and JACK Entertainment showed the strength, liquidity, durability and agility of their business models.",
         "As most of you know, I've spent time and have experience in a number of leisure, recreational and hospitality sectors, both as an operator and as a real estate investment manager. In coming to gaming real estate, as I did in 2017, I've come into a sector where the operators are I strongly believe the most dynamic and success driven operators in global leisure and hospitality. Over the course of this COVID-19 crisis, our five operators have shown just how skilled, energetic, decisive and driven they are. Here's what they have shown over the last few months; quick and effective action to shore up their liquidity; quick and effective action to minimize costs and cash burn rates during the period of closure; quick and effective action to be ready to reopen safely once given the green light; finally, quick and effective action to restore revenue and EBITDA when many other leisure sectors haven't even reopened yet.",
         "What we're also seeing is that our operators\u2019 businesses are key factors to the health of their local economies and to their state and local treasuries. As long as our operators can operate safely, their states and cities want them open for everyone's benefit. At VICI, we're sober, very sober in fact, about the fact that the COVID-19 crisis is not over. We cannot rule out the resurgence of the virus could depress demand for, or potentially lead to reclosures of casinos. But in what we've seen so far for our gaming tenants and for VICI, this crisis may ultimately provide strong proof of the strength and quality of the gaming REIT business model, which is built in turn on the strength and quality of our tenants\u2019 businesses.",
         "To hear more about our tenants, I'll now turn the call over to our President and COO, John Payne. John?"
      ],
      "John Payne": [
         "Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. The second quarter of 2020 was another very productive quarter for VICI. Over the past several months, we've worked jointly with our tenants, including Caesars, Century Casino and JACK Entertainment to provide limited short-term relief with respect to certain non-rent related requirements under our leases. As we said in the past, we will work to provide short-term solutions for our partners as needed based on each individual operator\u2019s unique circumstances. Accordingly, during this quarter, we've announced agreements to modify certain near-term capital expenditure requirements for Caesars and Century.",
         "Additionally, as noted in more detailed in our earnings press release, during the second quarter, we partnered with JACK Entertainment and agreed to fund a gaming expansion at Thistledown Racino, yielding more rent for VICI commencing in April 2022 at an attractive 10% cap rate, while also modifying our existing loan facility to provide certain temporary covenant relief and to add an additional five years to the initial lease term, as well as increasing the principle on the existing term loan and providing revolver facility to JACK. These agreements in short-term modifications help ensure that the operators we partner with are able to focus intently on reopening and operating their business through the current pandemic, while also protecting the integrity of our lease agreements and preserving long-term value for our stakeholders.",
         "As many of you have likely seen by now, the reopening of casino properties throughout the United States has been met with very robust consumer demand. Property across the regional landscapes have experienced healthy volumes. And in many cases, profitability is exceeding pre-COVID and prior year levels. We view this as a testament to the resilience, durability and longevity of the brick and mortar casino experience. While destination and fly-to markets may take longer to recover we remain believers in markets such as Las Vegas, which has proven over value proposition over a decade.",
         "As real estate investors, we think about investing in assets and markets over long periods of time. And believe the geographic exposure we have engineered with approximately 70% of rent coming from drive-to regional markets and the remaining 30% from the Las Vegas Strip represents a good balance for VICI and our shareholders during this time. Over the past, nearly three years, since we started VICI we have communicated our firm belief in the attractiveness of gaming as a real estate asset class.",
         "We believe the gaming industry through early reopening results is showcasing superiority to many other real estate sectors. While the gaming industry is unique and at times complex, we are fortunate as real estate investors to have decades of gaming experience within our management team, which greatly benefits us as we continue to navigate the pandemic and ultimately focus on investing for the long-term and growing VICI through accretive transactions.",
         "In terms of acquisitions and the outlook for growth on June 15, we announced a planned $400 million mortgage loan transaction with Caesars, which will be secured by the Caesars Forum Convention Center in Las Vegas. This structure allows VICI to benefit from $30.8 million of incremental annual income upon closing, while providing flexibility for the asset to ramp before ultimately converting to an OpCo/PropCo structure accelerating our call option from 2027 to 2025.",
         "Simultaneous with the mortgage transaction, we announced the intended purchase of approximately 23 acres of land from Caesars at a very attractive valuation of $4.5 million per acre. This land sits adjacent to the center of gravity of the Las Vegas Strip surrounded by assets that have proven their financial viability over the decades. And combined with our existing 27 acres along the same corridor gives us approximately 50 contiguous acres. Over time, we will seek to partner with third-parties for the development of that land with the goal of continuing our market beating growth well into the future.",
         "And finally, 10 days ago on July 20, we completed our transformative transaction as part of the Eldorado Caesars merger. We acquired Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City, Harrah\u2019s Laughlin and Harrah\u2019s New Orleans, and modified our existing leases with Caesars for total consideration of $3.2 billion. This transaction adds $253 million of incremental annual rent for VICI, it strengthen the terms of our leases with Caesars and restocks our embedded growth pipeline through ROFRs on two Las Vegas Strip assets, our put/call agreement on Harrah\u2019s Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand in Indianapolis and a ROFR on Horseshoe, Baltimore.",
         "In addition to this robust and unmatched embedded pipeline of opportunities, we continue to maintain a very active dialogue with our operators across gaming and other sectors, and believe our broad investment spectrum will continue to yield consistent, accretive growth for VICI\u2019s stockholders. Now I'll turn the call over to David who will discuss our financial results and balance sheet. David?"

         "I would now like to turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel of VICI Properties."

      "Samantha Gallagher": [
         "Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's second quarter 2020 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com.",
         "Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, intend, project or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition.",
         "During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our second quarter 2020 earnings release and our supplemental information.",
         "Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; and Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer. Ed and team will provide opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions.",
         "With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed."

John, as things have evolved coming out of obviously the pandemic disclosure period, et cetera, as you look ahead at drawing from kind of your deep industry knowledge and whatnot, I think it would be fair or at least from my perspective, would be fair to say that we do likely see some contraction of the go forward in terms of trends that we\u2019re seeing right now.",
            "In the event that, that happens, and we do start to see a little bit of that the macro economic impact of the pandemic and kind of trends, do you believe in this new interest rate paradigm and where we are right now, and kind of what we\u2019ve seen in terms of debt issuances from some operators coming in at meaningfully higher than what we\u2019ve seen previously spreads, that there will be a flow of kind of new opportunities as kind of the trading multiple versus the cost of capital dynamic has shrunk materially in favor of promoting more transaction activity?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, it\u2019s a very good question. Again, I think it\u2019s important to remember because we moved so fast that just back in April, the focus of these operators was really about getting open, right, and ensuring liquidity. We now are sitting here in July and it\u2019s about staying open. And I think to your point, Carlo, you\u2019re asking about, now are they starting to think strategically and are there going to be opportunities for us.",
            "What I would tell you is from our perspective, and I think I\u2019ve communicated this, not only we\u2019ve been working with our five current tenants throughout this pandemic, I\u2019ve stayed active with really almost every operator in the gaming industry, understanding their position, how their business doing, what they\u2019re seeing from their consumers and letting them know due to our positioning that David and Ed had put us in with ample liquidity that should there be an opportunity for us to transact with them, to help them grow their portfolio or provide liquidity or do a sale lease back that we\u2019re available and when we\u2019d like to talk to them.",
            "That doesn\u2019t really answer your question about predicting the future, but what I would tell you, it\u2019s our job to make sure that if there are transactions that at least we\u2019re in the mix, and people understand that we\u2019re moving from, as Ed said earlier in his remarks, from being completely on the defensive to back as we\u2019ve shown over the past weeks, back on the offensive side of the ball a little bit here. But Ed should also \u2013 Ed and David should also weigh in on that question."

         "Speaker": "John Payne"
      },
      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Carlo, you have rightly identified the fact that for a lot of operators in gaming, as frankly, across every major and hospitality sector, the cost of capital has gone up meaningfully in the last few months, both the cost of debt capital as you\u2019ve cited, but also the cost of equity capital. And as I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about before, we actually see the capital we provide through a sale leaseback. And in fact, being another form of equity, it is permanent capital. The recipient of it does not have to pay us back. And the cost of the capital we give them as simply the rent they pay us.",
            "So if you look at rent as expressed as a cap rate, it is generally much lower than their cost of equity currently and probably for a while yet. And to your point, it is becoming competitive with their cost of debt. So based on that, and also based on the fact that I think we\u2019re already starting to see operators, especially regional operators, who want to grow their store count, those who do want to grow their store count are very focused on partnering with REITs in order to win the bid because it will otherwise be very hard for an operator who wants to grow store count to win the bidding if they have to bid against an OpCo/PropCo bidding combination."

And David, if I just could, one quick one, I think if you kind of look at fourth quarter run rate EBITDA relative to kind of your current net debt levels, et cetera, you guys would probably be looking at leverage of around five times, which certainly does provide a little bit of cushion in a lower rate environment for you guys to go out and potentially take on some leverage. Could you kind of comment a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about the capital structure here moving forward in terms of the hypothetical potential transaction?"

As we talked about what\u2019s the equity raise in June, we\u2019ll likely match funds that equity with debt at some point in the future, which gives us $1.2-odd billion of total volume power if you go out and think about raising $600 million, $700 million of high yield here at some point in the future. So on an ultimate leverage neutral basis with the balance sheet, we\u2019ve got the functionality, the flexibility, and obviously the capital markets are going to do some backdrop right now for that."

So they obviously put themselves in a better position than the market at large had anticipated post-merger.

But as our embedded growth plan has ended or the ROFRs on the Las Vegas strip, we obviously talked quite a bit about our put call opportunity on the two assets in Indianapolis and then a ROFR Horseshoe Baltimore. So as Tom Reeg and Bret Yunker takeover Caesars, they\u2019ll continue to see where there\u2019s opportunities. We like all of those opportunities. I think you\u2019ve heard them talk about having enough supply in Las Vegas and potentially selling one or two assets there.",
            "As I said in my opening remarks, we\u2019re big believers in the long-term of Las Vegas. Las Vegas obviously has some short-term issues. They\u2019re going to have to deal with the decrease in flights, the loss of international business and the decrease the of convention business. But we really are big believers in that city for the long-term, based on consumer behavior, and absolutely the number of segments that people can be attracted.",

As I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve been quite active making sure people know, understanding what\u2019s going on with operators and spending time and talking to them.

It will be a function of whether or not we\u2019re happy with our cost of capital, I think it\u2019ll be more a function of the organic situation of what we\u2019re looking at, how much clarity and certainty there is around income production at the moment and how much clarity and confidence there is around forecasting the income production in the near to midterm. So again, I think those will be the key elements, it will drive the structuring decisions that we make. David, I don\u2019t know if you want to add to that."

The land that we already own, the 27 acres we already owned, were subject to the Caesars lease and Caesars have the right to use that land within our overall leisure arrangement with Caesars. With our purchase of the 23 acres we did not already own, we\u2019ve also built an agreement that will become part of this formal agreement once we execute on the transaction in fall, whereby Caesars will be able to continue to occupy the land until we have a use for it. And they will in turn for occupying the land, cover the cost of that land in regard to things like real estate tax, insurance and security.",

The long-term growth of Las Vegas is tourist destination. And frankly also the long-term growth of Las Vegas as a global city in its entirety. And we see that land as giving us a chance to participate again, not only in the growth of Las Vegas tourism, but in the growth of Las Vegas as a place where people choose to work and to live as well as to play. And this land gives us an opportunity to do what we most love doing, which is growing our business by growing our relationships.",

And what we will do is partner with great developers, great providers of development capital, who should get rewarded for development risk in order to realize the highest and best use of this land over time. And what does land ultimately does is provide part of the answer to the question where does VICI\u2019s growth come 5 to 10 years from now? Because again, over that kind of timeframe, we are still raging bulls on Las Vegas."

We don\u2019t bump our dividends mid-year or at the closing of transactions. So we\u2019ve got time before we make any decisions around the September declaration and ultimately October payout.

We obviously saw institutional investor have the caliber of Blackstone come in and validate Las Vegas real estate. They obviously are investing in long-term. They are long-term believers in the value of Las Vegas real estate we are.",

We do think Las Vegas can and will come roaring back for a whole host of reasons. But to your first point, regional, yes, you are absolutely right. This should really validate regional gaming as a real estate asset class as well as obviously an operating business given that it is far outperforming, just about any other leisure hospitality sector you can possibly identify.",
            "And it is not \u2013 it was not under secular threat coming into this year, it was posting very positive results as a sector in January and February. It is showing itself again very well here, and going forward you're not looking at the kind of overhang of secular negatives you are seeing in other categories like movie theaters where, Universal has said, yes, okay, after 17 days we will start streaming a movie. So again we think this is very validating the regional gaming.",

As you probably heard me say I mean, these are people, social clubs or country clubs or this is where people go to have their entertainment. It's where their friends are and you can see even during this worst pandemic that we've ever seen in our lifetime that as the businesses open up, they've been quite successful.",

When we pulled \u2013 we pulled guidance, part of the reason was also CECL, there's new noise in the non-cash implications of CECL. We will have a charge in the third quarter around related to closing of the Eldorado transaction and bringing those three new assets on their balance sheet. So it's hard to exactly predict that and pinpoint that. So we'll assess guidance probably returning to calendar into 2021 the next point in time."

And if \u2013 given that it's 9% secured paper and potentially JACK might have other options for that capital or another source of capital that's maybe a little bit cheaper.

But moreover our tenants are showing themselves to be performing very strongly and that I do believe to your point deserves ultimately reserves relating.

Or is it, I have the specific examples but it\u2019s in and around probably playing higher than where we've been acquiring assets just giving us an incremental add-on to an asset, but each situation, each cap rate is obviously dependent upon the unique facts and circumstances of the situation."

I think the self-reinforcing positive qualities of this business model as opposed to say the hotel business model where a third-party manager dictates capital that they all may or may not get a return on. We much prefer this model, because at the end of the day the operator is responsible for the capital, but it's also again the beneficiary of capital well-spent and is the one first harmed, when it is not spend in terms of loss competitiveness, revenue, and profit.",

Just in under the wire I suppose, just one question for me, John in your prepared remarks you said or mentioned a sort of 70-30 mix between the regional portfolio and the Vegas portfolio. The undertone has been here throughout the call, but just kind of curious to say it out loud, is this an appropriate mixture of VICI going forward or how do you think about that 70-30 split kind of strategically, obviously you'll underwrite acquisitions as they come?

We started this company 2.5 years ago with one tenant now have five and I think you'll ultimately see that grow. But we today were at 70-30, we like where that is. But I don't think Shaun, you hear and say that's where absolutely has to be exactly around those numbers. We just liked the diversification than being in many different types of markets.
