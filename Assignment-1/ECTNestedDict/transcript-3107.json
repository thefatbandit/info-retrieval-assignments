      "Mandeep Chawla": [
         "Thank you, Rob. And good morning everyone. As a reminder, we did not provide financial guidance for the second quarter of 2020 due to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, during the quarter, while the incurred costs related to COVID-19, including PPE premiums paid to ensure continuity of supply, and inefficiencies related to loss revenue due to an inability to secure supply, these costs were mostly offset by various recoveries.",
         "Our second quarter revenue came in higher than anticipated at $1.49 billion, mainly due to strong demand from service provider customers fueled by our JDM offering, revenue increased 3% year-over-year, and 13% sequentially.",
         "Our non-IFRS operating margin was 3.4%, up 90 basis points year-over-year and up 50 basis points sequentially. IFRS earnings per share were $0.10 compared to a $0.05 loss per share for the second quarter of 2019. Non-IFRS adjusted earnings per share were $0.25, up $0.13 compared to the second quarter of 2019 and up $0.09 sequentially.",
         "Our ATS segment was 34% of our consolidated revenue down from 39% compared to the second quarter of last year, ATS revenue was down 11% compared to the prior year period, and down 9% sequentially.",
         "Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by demand weakness and commercial aerospace and industrial, largely due to COVID-19 partially offset by strong demand in capital equipment and new program ramps in Healthtech.",
         "Our CCS segment revenue was up 12% year-over-year and up 29% sequentially due to strength in JDM, including with service provider and our success in securing critical components to meet increased demand.",
         "Within our CCS segment, the communications end market represented 43% of our consolidated second quarter revenue up from 39% in the second quarter of last year. Communications revenue in the quarter was a 14% year-over-year, largely driven by strengthen our JDM business partly offset by a reduction in fiscal revenue as we continued our plan to disengagement. Sequentially, communications revenue was up 27% driven by demand strength in JDM.",
         "Our enterprise end market represented 23% of consolidated revenue in the second quarter, up from 22% in the same period last year. Enterprise revenue in the quarter was up 10% year-over-year driven by strengthen in JDM partially offset by plan disengagements as part of our CCS portfolio optimization program. Sequentially, enterprise revenue was up 32% primarily due to demand strengthened JDM and seasonality.",
         "We are pleased by the growth in JDM as we continue to ramp several performance and support increased levels of demand from our hyper scale customers. In the first half of 2020, our JDM business achieved more than $400 million of revenue up 85% year-over-year and accounted for 14% of our total revenue for the first half of 2020.",
         "Our Top 10 customers represented 68% of revenue for the second quarter up from 65% in the same period last year and up from 66% last quarter. For the second quarter, we had one customer contributing 10% or more total revenue compared to two customers in the second quarter of 2019, and one customer last quarter.",
         "Turning to segment margins, EPS segment margin of 3.1% was up 40 basis points sequentially, mainly due to improve profitability in A&D. Our capital equipment business continued its recovery, posting another quarter of profitability as we ramped in programs.",
         "Year-over-year ATS segment margins were 30 basis points as improvements in capital equipment driven by higher productivity and volume leverage more than offset reduced profit contribution from A&D.",
         "CCS segment margins of 3.6% came in above our target range of 2% to 3% and were up 120 basis points year-over-year and up 60 basis points sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential margin improvements were driven by improved operating leverage, favorable mix including strong growth in JDM s positive impact of our productivity efforts.",
         "Moving to some other financial highlights for the quarter. IFRS net earnings for the quarter were $13.3 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to a net loss of $6.1 million, or negative $0.05 per share in the same quarter of last year.",
         "Adjusted gross margin of 7.5% was up 50 basis points compared to last year and up 20 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year and sequential improvements were largely driven by volume leverage productivity and improve mix in CCS.",
         "Year-over-year, our adjusted SG&A of $53 million was down $3 million, primarily due to lower variable spend partially offset by higher variable compensation. SG&A was up $3 million sequentially, mostly due to unfavorable foreign exchange.",
         "Non-IFRS operating earnings were 50.8 million, up $14.1 billion from the same quarter of last year and up $12.7 million sequentially. Our non-IFRS adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 24% compared to 36% for the prior year period, and 24% last quarter.",
         "For the second quarter adjusted net earnings were $31.7 million, compared to $15.4 million for the prior year period. Non-IFRS adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 was up $0.13 year-over-year, mainly due to higher operating earnings and lowered interest expense.",
         "Sequentially non-IFRS adjusted earnings were up $0.09, mainly due to higher earnings and lower interest expense, partly offset by higher tax. Non-IFRS adjusted ROIC of 12.9% was up 4.5% compared to the same quarter last year and up 3.4% sequentially.",
         "Moving on to working capital. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion, an increase of $120 million relative to last year and an increase of $134 million sequentially, as we invest in hyper scalar growth and work to burn down inventory in markets impacted by COVID-19.",
         "Inventory turns were 4.9 down 0.1 turns year-over-year and up and 0.1 turns sequentially. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $11 million or approximately 1% of revenue. Non-IFRS. free cash flow was $38 million in the second quarter compared to $47 million for the same period last year. Year-to-date, we have generated $92 million in non-IFRS free cash flow and continue to target generating $100 million or more of non-IFRS free cash flow in 2020.",
         "Cash cycle days in the second quarter were 60-days an improvement of five-days year-over-year and an improvement of nine-days sequentially. Our cash deposits at the end of June were $222 million up at $87 million sequentially, as we continue to work with our customers on working capital improvements.",
         "Moving on to our balance sheet and other key measures, Celestica continues to maintain a strong balance sheet. And our cash balance at the end of the second quarter was $436 million, down $1 million year-over-year and down $36 million sequentially.",
         "Combined with our $450 million revolver, which remains undrawn, we continue to have a strong liquidity position of approximately $900 million. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our current business needs.",
         "We continue to make progress towards deleveraging our balance sheet in the quarter by repaying $61 million of long-term debt. Our gross debt position was $470 million at the end of June, while our net debt was $34 million, down $25 million sequentially.",
         "Our gross debt to non-IFRS trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio improved by 0.3 turns sequentially to 1.7 turns.",
         "At the end of June, we were complying with all financial covenants under our credit agreement. In the near-term, our priority is to continue to reduce our leverage, providing us with increasing levels of flexibility for future investments and lowered interest costs.",
         "Over the long-term through, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We will continue to work towards generating strong free cash flow and plan to return approximately half to shareholders while investing the other half in the business.",
         "In the second quarter, we incurred $7 million of restructuring charges, including costs to right size our commercial aerospace and industrial cost base to reflect a reduction in overall demand. We continue to take restructuring actions in the third quarter.",
         "As we look to the next quarter, we continue to see a dynamic environment driven by COVID-19. Although the situation is improving in most jurisdictions, and our operations have largely stabilized given the continuing uncertainty potential COVID-19 resurgences and their impact on our customers, supply chain and factory utilization, we do not feel it would be prudent to provide specific financial guidance for the third quarter.",
         "While we are not providing guidance, we do anticipate the third quarter to be largely in line with our second quarter results. Should conditions neither improve nor deteriorate further.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Rob for additional color and an update on our priorities."

         "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Celestica Q2 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.",
         "I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Craig Oberg. Please go ahead."
      ],
      "Robert Mionis": [
         "Thank you, Craig. Good morning and thank you for joining today\u2019s conference call. Celestica second quarter results reflect solid execution in a dynamic and challenging environment. We had a solid quarter of revenue growth improved year-over-year and sequential operating margin, generated robust free cash flow and pay down long-term debt.",
         "Throughout this challenging time, our global team has done exceptional work to maintain continuity of operations, safeguard the health of our employees, and deliver on customer commitments.",
         "As government restrictions ease around the globe, our operations have substantially stabilized our supply chain is gradually returning to normal, and suppliers are working to ramp up capacity to meet increased demand driven by certain in markets. Circumstances continue to change, but we will adapt to address any new challenges.",
         "While we are experiencing demand strength in the capital equipment, Healthtech and service provider markets, we have seen softness and other markets including commercial aerospace and industrial.",
         "Our CCS segments posted another quarter of solid performance expanding segment margins on a year-over-year basis. In fact, CCS has extended margins sequentially for the fifth consecutive quarter, and is operating above our 2% to 3% margin range.",
         "In our ATS segment, we are seeing solid performance in a number of our businesses. However, ATS segment margins remain below our target range of 5% to 6% due to the demand headwinds in our commercial, aerospace, and industrial businesses resulting from the pandemic. Overall, we are pleased that the strong foundation and diversification we have built across our end markets is helping us manage through a highly volatile environment.",
         "I will provide some additional color on our end markets, but first, I will turn the call over to Mandeep to give you further details on our second quarter results. ",
         "Thank you, Mandeep. In the first half of the year, we strengthen our position in both CCS and ATS. While we are still facing a variety of headwinds, we believe that the strength of our portfolio is helping to mitigate some of these challenges.",
         "We feel that our portfolio shaping and productivity actions over the last few years, while difficult at the time, have better positioned us to deliver value added solutions across a broad set of markets.",
         "Now turning to ATS. The challenges we are experiencing from COVID-19 are adversely impacting several ATS markets are also creating opportunities and others. Our capital equipment business posted another profitable quarter, and we continue to see overall demand building.",
         "Our growth is driven by increased demand in our base business, as well as new program ramps across a number of capital equipment end markets. Our success in securing new programs has been enabled by our performance and breadth of global capabilities.",
         "In A&D, while we had record level bookings in the first half of the year, and demand in our defense business remain stable, we continue to experience lower demand in our commercial aerospace business. Profit contributions from our A&D business improved sequentially on lower revenue. And we continue to take action so just the cost base to reflect this reduced level of demand.",
         "The actions we have taken started to yield results in Q2 and we expect A&D profitability to improve as we exit the year barring any further additional negative impacts from COVID-19. We continue to be a leader in the A&D market, providing the world's top A&D customers with product lifecycle solutions. A good example of that is a recent five-year renewal of our operating place agreement in Mississauga, Canada with a prominent A&D customer.",
         "As a reminder, we support this customer with final assembly, test and repair and overhaul for key product lines supporting commercial and defense markets. The renewed agreement not only strengthens our relationship with this customer, but provides a strong foundation that enables us to deliver product lifecycle solutions to a broad set of other customers as well.",
         "Within industrial in the near-term, we are seeing weak demand across our customer base, as a result of COVID-19. As the macro environment improves, we anticipate the industrial market will gradually recover.",
         "Within Healthtech, we continue to see strong demand for diagnostic equipment and modest improvements in demand for elective surgery products. We expect to see strong growth continue in Healthtech throughout 2020, as we ramped production of essential products, such as medical devices and diagnostic tools that are critical in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients. We are happy to do our part in the fight against this pandemic by providing critical solutions to a number of customers.",
         "Now turning to CCS, our CCS segment delivered strong performance as a result of increased demand from our service provider market, as customers expand and upgrade data centers in support of growing cloud and online requirements. The strong revenue growth is driven by key wins over the last 18-months and compounded by the recent surge of demand due to the work and learn from home trend.",
         "Growth from our service provider customers more than offset revenue clients from portfolio shaping and communications and enterprise and the impact of COVID-19. Strong margin performances in CCS was driven primarily by portfolio actions, operating leverage and improved mix including a growing JDM business. ",
         "As Mandeep mentioned, our JD and business continues to thrive with another quarter of impressive growth. Within JDM, we invest in leading edge product roadmaps and design capabilities and provide a full suite of products solutions across all IP infrastructure data center technologies.",
         "Their combined product life cycle capability with JDM, which are similar to ATS are intended to help customers reach the markets more efficiently from design to manufacturing and aftermarket support.",
         "JDM drives more value for our customers early in the product life cycle, thereby creating stickier and mutually beneficial relationships. We believe JDM and will continue to be a driver of growth for the company in the future.",
         "Turning to the Cisco disengagement. The transition is progressing as planned and we expect the transition to be largely complete by the end of the year. We have a large bundle of opportunities targeted towards [Thailand] (Ph), and we are pleased with the progress we are making the back fill fiscal revenue with higher value add solutions. We remain on-track to achieve our goals with a richer mix of programs.",
         "Looking at our business overall, there is uncertainties surrounding the impact that COVID-19 might have in the near-term. I remain confident in our long-term outlook. I believe that there are tremendous opportunities in front of us across both ATS and CCS.",
         "We believe Celestica has a solid foundation to whether uncertain times, we also believe our balance sheet remains strong as a result of strong free cash flow generation. With our moderate amount of debt and high level of liquidity, we are excited about our future opportunities for sustainable profitable growth.",
         "I want to thank our global team, who come together with passion and determination to keep our operations running effectively, their resilience and commitment to working together to adapt to this situation have been nothing less than extraordinary.",
         "We look forward to updating you over the coming quarters with that, I would like to turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hi, thanks and congrats on a great quarter. I mean, I know things are very kind of still volatile. But you know a while ago, you provided some kind of long-term goals for your margins. And if you look at the margins this quarter, CCS is exceeding those margins. ATS still not quite there. But, if you were to look at the mix of business and the growing volumes in chips, can you kind of give us an update of what you are thinking in terms of long-term margin goals, and if you think have changed at all, like would CCS be moving higher with maybe ATS be moving lower stable, just kind of give us a sense of where you think you can be good longer term."

      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, good morning, Gus, and thanks for the question. So, we continue to feel that the target margin range of 3.75 to 4.5 is the right range for us. And the ranges that we have in place for both CCS and ATS continue to hold, so 5% to 6% for ATS and 2% to 3% for CCS.",
            "So, if I just take you those, we are very pleased with the performance that we saw in CCS and pleased that they were able to operate above their margin range. It is one quarter and it is too early to say if their target margin range should be raised. But clearly, when they have strong operating leverage, and very positive things that they have had, they are going to perform very, very well.",
            "On the ATS side, we are seeing good momentum to get back into the 5% to 6% range. But we still have businesses that are not yet there, capital equipment is continuing to scale, aerospace and defense started to take some restructuring actions is not yet where it used to be and then we are continuing to see ramping programs in industrial and in Healthtech. There is also a mix just that is happening a little bit where we are having a less profit contribution from A&D.",
            "So, in order to get to the 3.75 to 4.5 on a sustainable basis, we need both of the businesses to be in the ranges. In order for ATS to get back into their range we need to continue to see improvements in capital equipment in A&D and we also need to see some level of modest recovery in industrial. And then on the CCS side, if they are operating at the high end of their range that will support us to get to where we want to go."

         "Remarks": [
            "Just quick follow-up, so on the ATS I mean, you have - improving, but aerospace still weak and Boeing cancelling programs. I mean, which of these two is the bigger influence, volume increases in chips or cost restructuring and in aerospace?"

            "And although we are continuing to see strong market demand, we are also ramping a number of programs that we have won and so as those programs reach steady state we will see improved margins. ",
            "On the aerospace and defense side. As Rob had mentioned, we continue to have a stable outlook on the defense side. So, most of the actions we are taking are in response to the decline in commercial aerospace.",
            "And so while we did take restructuring actions in the second quarter, there are actions that are continuing into the third quarter, and we would expect improve profitability in A&D as we go through the year."

      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So from a pricing perspective, it is actually much improved. We measure shortages that are gaiting revenue the beginning of the quarter. And for Q2, it is actually - Q3 is actually at pre-COVID level.",
            "That being said, we do have some hyper demand in support of service provider markets. And that is causing us some general combinations just some broader electronic components. And there are some high reliability parts that are impacting aerospace and defense business that are kind of facing as well. But broadly speaking, I would say, at least at this time, the component situation is much improved from the quarter of [indiscernible]."

      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, with industrial, a lot of the revenue declines or the overall majority of the revenue declines are really COVID related. A lot of our markets is in Europe, and with the economy shutting down, a lot of our products get installed in homes and businesses and as such business kind of shutdown which kind of shut down the production lines, we do see Europe slowly opening up, which is a positive sign. And then also, basis have generally stopped, kind of back on spending.",
            "So, broadly speaking, I would say everything in industrial is really is driven by COVID, as the COVID environment improved, we do expect the industrial market to gradually improve as well. We also have a fair amount of new programs that are ramping and when they actually come to market that should give us a little bit of an uplift, which would be into next year."

And so I want to talk about managing place, we had talks about the renewed agreement that is in one of the weaker segments, is the industry moving more towards this type of model, looking back over the relationship, what are the positives and negatives of the management place and do you see this as something that can really expand going forward?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Hi, Robert. You know I think it is a bespoke offering that we have and it fits certain situations with certain customers, it comes really into play, where the risk profile of moving the work is so large that our customer feels it is better to take it over in place that being large fixed costs or monuments or tribal knowledge.",

The question I have thought is what are some of the variables, because it seems like even in your prepared comments, you mentioned with Q3 governments are opening more, supply chains are getting closer to normal or proving and kind of lots of improvement comments. It would seem that that would almost imply that Q3 should be better than Q2. So maybe if you can help me just bridge the misunderstanding I'm having there about why it would be kind of relatively flattish sequentially when it seems like all the data points around the world are kind of pointing towards some improvements in Q3?"

So our factories were at about 95% utilization at the end of Q2. Our expectation is that that would continue to through the third quarter, our critical suppliers impacted is down to very low single-digit percentage, we expect that will continue through the third quarter.",

But I mean, given that you have some liquidity now, does it make sense at this stage of the cycle to look at possible further M&A to supplement the growth that you're seeing, especially given valuations have come down?

We are not going to continue at this pace, we do think it is good to have a level of debt on the balance sheet, it helps us in many different areas.",

And so we will look at various options to return cash to shareholders by [indiscernible] one of them.",

We are looking at capability based targets whether it is in our aerospace and defense segment again or other high reliability segments as well.",

During at that time and to look at local drive the greatest level of value for shareholders.
