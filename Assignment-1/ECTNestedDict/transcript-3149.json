         "Good morning. And welcome to Alliance Data's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties have been placed on a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, the floor will be opened for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, that today\u2019s call is being recorded.

      "Ralph Andretta": [
         "Thank you. And good morning. Thanks for joining us to review our second quarter results.",
         "Since our last earnings report in April, which came merely weeks after COVID-19, was declared a global pandemic, our associates have continued to navigate exceptionally challenging conditions and rise to the occasion across every facet of our business.",
         "I continue to be inspired by the dedication of our leadership team and resilience of our associates, all of whom have successfully adjusted to new and different working environments, while maintaining required client service levels, supporting each other and doing what we can in our communities to show our support to people and organizations in need during this time.",
         "Likewise, we have done our part to support our card members, our collectors and our retail partners. For our card members, we introduced a number of forbearance programs, which used by card members approximately \u2013 to approximately 10% of our accounts receivable to relieve financial pressure during this difficult time.",
         "For our AIR MILES collectors, as travel slowed, we pivoted our reward options to at-home, delivery and service options and launched a digital redemption program. For our retail partners, we worked to support e-commerce and direct-to-consumer engagement. BrandLoyalty has used this time to support its retailers by leveraging digital channels for loyalty programs and increased engagement.",
         "In summary, for the second quarter, we are managing well in the COVID-19 environment, remaining profitable, and we believe we will have adequate liquidity to manage through this period of significant stress.",
         "Sales and credit were better than we anticipated. People are spending and meeting their credit obligations. They are engaged with us and our brand partners, and we are investing in our future with people, process and technology.",
         "Turning to slide four, let's discuss the key takeaways from our second quarter results. On a consolidated basis, our results reflected the challenging environment. Revenue was down 27% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA net was down 50%.",
         "LoyaltyOne results were mixed. AIR MILES benefited from a shift in focus to items that are more relevant for time at home. This, combined with expense reduction, led to 5% improvement over last year's constant currency adjusted EBITDA. BrandLoyalty results were less favorable, with revenue and adjusted EBITDA both down, as clients in the grocery business deferred loyalty spending to later in the year.",
         "For card services, our second quarter sales activity progressively improved throughout the period as stores reopened. Sales ended 14% down as we exited June compared to last year. However, sales were down 36% to Q2 of last year. Although, sales were down considerably, our products and offerings remain attractive. Within this challenging environment, our focus has been on managing what is in within our control, our service levels and our costs.",
         "In the second quarter, our cost reduction programs resulted in approximately $50 million of additional savings. Consistent with what we announced previously, we are on track to deliver $240 million of savings for 2020, meaning we expect to reduce expenses by another $100 million in the second half of this year, primarily attributable to additional procurement and operating efficiencies. We are positioning the business to be far leaner and more profitable once top line growth returns.",
         "Our credit metrics and payment activity were better than expected. I will highlight some of those metrics after Tim discusses our financial results. The majority of our card members continues to shop across all channels.",
         "Our card members, including those currently in forbearance programs, continue to make payments, indicating continued engagement and responsiveness in managing their payment obligations. The positive performance, together with lower sales volume, led to lower accounts receivable and resulted in a modest reserve release this quarter.",
         "However, given the uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining a robust allowance for loan loss exceeding 13% of our period end receivables, which is an increase of over 110 basis points from the previous quarter.",
         "Our loan loss reserve reflects a more conservative economic outlook in the first quarter with a further reduction in GDP and a further increase in unemployment. Finally, we will continue to invest in our business. Technology and talent are at the top of our list.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Tim to cover the financials.",
         "Thanks, Tim. The next few slides provide insight on sales activity, the credit environment and how we are managing partner bankruptcies. We will also touch upon the way forward and how we are preparing to emerge from the current environment.",
         "On slide 10, you can see at the end of June, 92% of our retail partner stores were open. With the stores opening, net credit sales improved from a negative 47% during the shelter-in-place period to a negative 14% in the second half of June.",
         "Obviously, store-based sales showed the most dramatic improvement from a low of 78% during shelter-in-place to down 32% at the end of June. Direct sales returned in May and continued to perform. Lastly, general purpose sales are improving as states reopen.",
         "We track sales by region very closely. As you can see on slide 11, sales grew progressively as our retail partners reopened stores. There was an erratic [ph] improvement over April results.",
         "Since quarter end, some hotspots have returned to closing stores, but the initial impact has been generally balanced by momentum in other states. That said, we are closely monitoring these trends and believe that our multi-channel credit solutions, and particularly digital offerings are even more important to our retail partners during this unusual period.",
         "On slide 12, you can see payment behaviors from our card members, both non-enrolled and enrolled in forbearance. As I mentioned earlier, approximately 10% of our accounts receivable was in forbearance at the peak.",
         "Payment trends in the environment have remained stable. We are pleased with these trends, which in part reflect the benefit from government stimulus and enhanced unemployment, but also underscore our responsible credit management efforts.",
         "Moving from top to bottom, the chart shows zero payers, those who maintained a balance and those who paid in full. Card members not enrolled in forbearance, representing about 90% of our accounts receivable, demonstrated strong engagement and payment behavior in the early stage of the pandemic. Over 85% of those not enrolled made a payment, which is significantly up over last year. While these types of payments have shifted, it is important to note that, these card members are making payments.",
         "Those enrolled in forbearance also showed strong engagement. The majority of our forbearance efforts have been shorter term solutions, such as payment holiday, and more than half of those continue to make payments even though they were not obligated to do so.",
         "These payment behavior trends supported a better-than-expected delinquency rate in the second quarter. Since its behavior was supported by stimulus, enhanced unemployment, reduced discretionary spend and forbearance, a high level of uncertainty remains for the second half of the year and into 2021. This is reflected in our loan loss reserve. The current environment has either caused or accelerated a number of retail bankruptcies, some of which are our partners.",
         "On slide 13, we provide some information and context on how bankruptcies effect our business. First, approximately 6% of our current accounts receivable are within retailers that have bankruptcy filings.",
         "As we've mentioned in the past calls, when retailers declare bankruptcy, there was little immediate impact on our economics. We do not lend to the retailer so that bankruptcy does not affect our accounts receivable.",
         "Our customer is the card member. We maintain our relationship with the card members and the card members continue to make payments on their balances. Without additional purchases at the retailer, remaining card members will maintain balances and pay over time, which proves profitable to us as we no longer incur sales or marketing expenses associated with customer acquisition or sales activities.",
         "Most bankruptcies filed by our partners are Chapter 11 proceedings with little change for us. In the worst case, for those who file or shift to Chapter 7 liquidation, we need to replace the sales generated by the retailer to continue to grow our accounts receivable.",
         "We maintain an active pipeline of prospects and continue to focus our business development efforts on retailers in growing attractive verticals. The way forward begins with good governance and talent.",
         "As you can see on slide 14, our Board of Directors continues to implement its multiyear refreshment plan. Three of our long tenured Directors completed their Board service this year and we have added two highly qualified directors who bring new skills, views and experience to our Board. The Board also elected a new Board Chair in Roger Ballou.",
         "As previously mentioned, we added key talent to Alliance Data. Val Greer joined us from Citi, where she was Head of co-brands, has successfully revitalized their portfolio, card technology infrastructure and drove strong growth. This is important role at Alliance Data. Val will lead our efforts to attract and retain brand partners and drive profitable growth.",
         "We will continue to invest in data and analytics and customer-facing digital capabilities, while we migrate to a more flexible business model, reducing our cost to serve.",
         "We continue to renew and sign partners in high-growth verticals, including health and beauty, home improvement and home furnishings. We recently signed a multiyear private label renewal with The Tile Shop, a specialty retailer of stone and manmade tiles.",
         "We also launched a private label commercial card program for small businesses owners with floor and decor and signed a new private label credit card program for SalonCentric, one of the largest US wholesale distributors of professional salon and beauty supplies. Finally, we remain highly focused on our balance sheet, and we'll continue to work to improve our liquidity and cash flow.",
         "In conclusion, for the remainder of the year, we will focus on two key areas. First, on our current near term performance across the enterprise, as we continue to work and deliver for card members, customers and partners. I'd like to thank our associates across all lines of business for their efforts and hard work during this very challenging and unprecedented time.",
         "We continue to evaluate our return-to-office plans as we monitor the progression of the virus in the US and maintain proper safety work protocols in international markets where infection rates have tempered. The health and safety of our associates always comes first.",
         "We will also continue to monitor the credit environment closely in the second half of the year, manage our risk strategies and maintain prudent reserve levels. We will continue to employ a disciplined approach to managing our balance sheet and risk profile.",
         "And second, while we are managing the present environment, we are also working to shape our future and position ourselves to emerge as a strong competitor. Our go-forward focus will include rightsizing our expense base, to reduce our cost to serve, partnering with clients in growing attractive verticals and building to scale, growing with our partners through payment capabilities that integrate with any purchasing channel, providing products and services that are relevant to the consumer to meet their purchasing, borrowing and saving needs and managing our balance sheet to improve shareholder returns and reduce risk.",
         "As we continue to develop our long-term strategy, we will take advantage of opportunities late this year to share plans through conference calls, future earning calls and participation in investor conferences.",
         "With that, operator, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions."
      ],
      "Tim King": [
         "Thank you, Ralph. And good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide five to discuss our consolidated results for the quarter. During the second quarter, revenue was down 27% versus last year\u2019s $979 million as the company and each of the segments were impacted by the pandemic.",
         "At Card Services, many of our retail partners were essentially closed at the beginning of quarter and began to reopen as the quarter progressed. As you may recall, during the last two weeks of March, credit sales were down [50%] [ph]. This improved approximately down 14% at the end of June.",
         "For our LoyaltyOne segment, AIR MILES travel redemption decreased dramatically and at BrandLoyalty, grocers did not need programs offering to drive traffic. Income from continuing operations was $38 million, down 73%, and our earnings per share from continuing operations were down 70% at $0.81 per share.",
         "Pre-provision earnings before taxes of $297 million were down 34%, which was impacted by a 27% revenue decline and an asset impairment charge taken in the quarter. I will discuss the asset impairment charge in more detail in a few slides.",
         "Net income declined 72% year-over-year and net income per diluted share was down 69%, reflecting a lower share count. While income measures were down, we offset some of the COVID-19 impact to substantial cost savings, including volume-related savings and operational efficiencies.",
         "Specifically, in the second quarter of 2020, we took out approximately $50 million of non-volume direct operating expenses. This follows $90 million of realized savings in the first quarter for approximately - approximate total of $140 million of benefit cost initiatives year-to-date.",
         "As we mentioned in past earning calls, we expect that we will continue to see cost efficiencies. For the remainder of the year, we expect approximately $100 million of additional cost savings or approximately $50 million for each of the next two quarters.",
         "Let's turn to slide six, and we'll discuss the results of LoyaltyOne, which includes the AIR MILES reward program in Canada and the Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty. Revenue for the quarter was $150 million, were down 40% versus the prior year. Excluding Precima, which was divested in the first quarter of the year, revenue decreased by 35%.",
         "On a constant currency basis, revenue was down 38%, but adjusted EBITDA was down only 11%, reflecting expense reductions and continuing emphasis on prudent cost management.",
         "Turning to AIR MILES, revenue was down 28% on a constant currency basis, primarily a result of the Precima. AIR MILES issue declined 26% as a result of softer consumer discretionary spend especially in our credit card program. Redemptions were down 42%, primarily as a result of reduced travel-related redemption, offset somewhat by stronger merchandise redemption activity.",
         "However, due to strong expense management and margin improvements, AIR MILES, as Ralph mentioned, the EBITDA net improved 5% on a constant currency basis.",
         "BrandLoyalty revenue declined 44% on a constant currency basis due primarily due to fewer short-term grocery loyalty programs in market and delay of major sporting events such as the Euro Championship and the Olympics.",
         "So now let's move on to slide seven, and we'll discuss Card Services. Card Services revenue was down 24% and adjusted EBITDA was down 56% versus the prior quarter.",
         "Operating expenses declined 14%, benefiting from cost reduction efforts and volume-related savings. Including in the expense for the quarter was a $34 million non-cash impairment charge related to the underperformance of certain client programs and the consolidation of an office location.",
         "As for provision, $350 million of charge-offs were offset by the release of $55 million from our allowance. This release was largely a function of the $1.9 billion end-of-period accounts receivable decreased from March 2020. On a sequential quarter basis, our end-of-period receivables were down approximately 11% versus our allowance down 2.6%.",
         "So the release was really all volume-driven. Even after the release, our reserves of 12 -$2.1 billion increased as a percentage of our end-of-period accounts receivables to 13.3% from 12.1%. This higher reserve rate is driven by a worse economic outlook, including a deterioration in outlook for both our GDP and our unemployment rates.",
         "Moving to funding costs. They were $102 million, down 3% year-over-year. Lower normalized average receivables were offset by higher cost of funds, as our short-term dated liabilities pay down increasing the average duration of our funding.",
         "On slide eight, I'm going to review some of the Card Service metrics, starting with credit sales, which were down 36%, as Ralph mentioned. There is a sharp decline, but this marks a progressive recovery from the low point in April. As you may recall, again, the end of April, our sales were down 50%. Ralph's got a slide, and we'll talk about that in more detail later.",
         "Normalized card receivables, which include held-for-sale receivables were down 12% year-over-year at $16.2 billion, and end of period receivables were down 10% at $15.8 billion. While the forbearance programs have resulted in positive consumer behavior, the program have had offsetting effect on yields.",
         "Overall, yields decreased 350 basis points, mostly due to lower late fee yields. There's also been some pressure on our finance charges due to the Federal Reserve discount rate cuts.",
         "On a positive note, because of our cost management success, operating expenses as a percent of receivables, excluding mark-to-market and asset impairments was down - was 9.1%, down 30 basis points year-over-year even after a significant decline in receivables. Principal loss rate was 7.6%, up 150 basis points and delinquency rate was 4.3%, down 90 basis points year-over-year.",
         "Now let's move on to slide nine, and I am going to talk a little bit about our liquidity. In April, we suspended our share repurchase programs and reduced our dividend, consistent with actions taken by others in the industry. As we - this is obviously, we're prudently managing our cash flow and our balance sheet. This result in a very stable cash position at the parent of $1.2 billion, which is consistent with the cash we had on the balance sheet and liquidity we have on the balance sheet at the end of Q1. Our long-term debt maturity profile has not changed with $2 billion of term debt not coming due until December 2022.",
         "Moving to the banks. We haven\u2019t seen a sequential increase in the collective cash position of $300 million for a total of $1.2 billion in cash. Further, the capital ratios have improved with the total risk-based capital on the combined bank now sitting at 19.7%.",
         "Funding had also continued to be strong with availability both in securitization and deposit markets. Our retail deposits continue to grow as a funding source and now represents over 11% of our bank lending.",
         "I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Ralph."

            "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW."

      },
      "2": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks. Good morning. I am glad you guys are doing well. I guess, if we strip out provisions for a minute and understanding the returns on the business are quite high and probably not reflected in the stock, I\u2019m just trying to think about pre-provision profitability going forward.",
            "Are you guys suggesting that going forward, a combination of some of the expense saves will sort of mitigate the revenue yield weakness because the revenue yield is down 500 basis points or so from its peak? Maybe you could just walk us through sort of the profitability of the business going forward?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Sanjay Sakhrani"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Hey, Sanjay. Thanks for the questions. Obviously, it\u2019s Tim. So let\u2019s start with the expense portion. Clearly, what we outlined is, on a year-over-year basis about $250 million, $240 million of total operating expense saves, and that is not volume-related. Those are operating expense savings.",
            "So obviously, if you look at our P&L, you\u2019ll see a much larger number of dollars saved, but period takeout was about $240 million is what we're - we either realized or going to realize.",
            "Then you work your way back up to the revenue line item and the effect - our yields are two-fold. One is I\u2019ll start with the smaller is going to be the effect of the discount rate translated into our yields. Those are down 40, 50 basis points. There is a little bit of noise around the charge-off, the purification, but the vast majority of that drop then comes from the late fees.",
            "So of that, 350 basis points, about two-thirds of that is a function of our late fees. The real wildcard is going to be for us, you know, the positivity associated with the - the credit metrics is obviously then turning back around and having some negative effect on the yield, and that's the wildcard for us.",
            "So, if we continue to have very good credit metrics, I\u2019d expect that we continue to have pressure on late fees. Our credit metrics begin to deteriorate, I\u2019d expect that my credit, my yields, and especially my late fees start to come back in the line."

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And then, when we think about the provision and the reserves, when you - when I look at that reserve rate and I think about what that implies in terms of a macro. Could you just talk about, what you're assuming inside for your macro assumption?",
            "And then, if I\u2019m doing the math correctly, are you suggesting sort of the associated charge-off rate for that reserve rates like 9% annualized. Is that the right way to think about it? Thanks."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Sanjay Sakhrani"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. We didn\u2019t - I'll start with the last question and work my way back to the assumptions. We don\u2019t necessarily have a charge-off rate that we\u2019re assigning to that because the way you end up setting allowances the math is so different. I\u2019m looking at, obviously, all my receivables on the balance sheet today and look at the total dollars that are going to charge off over the life of those loans. So I didn't really translate that back. And we don't really translate back into a charge-off rate.",
            "But having said that, we talked about how we did set the provision, which is clearly, we look at all the math associated with the different buckets. And if you look back on page 14 of our 10-Q from last quarter, we basically break out the different segments. And we look how those segments are going to perform overtime. And then we, of course, we choose \u2013 the question we get to choose, what type of economic environment do we think we're going to have.",
            "We use Moody's as our economic overlay. We use the most conservative economic overlay from Moody's. Those of you familiar with it would be the S-4, which is a probability that we are going to perform - 96% chance, we performed better than we overlaid in that.",
            "And that includes having a double dip on recession, that has unemployment rates back in the 13%, meaning you have a double dip and unemployment rates go back to 13%, into 2021. Then we have at least a 10% decrease in GDP. So again, the most conservative numbers, we\u2019re footing to and that off of Moody\u2019s S-4."

And now you\u2019ve been at ADS, I think, long enough to get your arms around, obviously, a very difficult situation. But as you look at this business, what do you think - how do you compare it to where you\u2019ve been? What do you view as the strength?",

            "Yeah. So I've spent, let's see what it is about 25 years at Citi and American Express and six months at ADS. So, I will give you my perspective. I think there\u2019s strength here. I think the reputation of ADS with retailers of all kind, not just apparel, but all retailers, really will help us going forward in structuring the right kind of deals in the marketplace. So, I\u2019m thrilled about that.",
            "I think the nimbleness of ADS has been refreshing to me. We\u2019re able to pivot pretty quickly because of the size of our organization. Decision-making is quicker than in organizations I\u2019ve been in before. So that\u2019s all been very refreshing.",
            "The leadership team is very focused on what needs to get done. There are no ancillary things we need to worry about. We\u2019re focused, particularly in the Card Services business, on serving customers and on striking deals that are right for both the partner and ADS. So to me, those are things going forward that make good sense for us.",
            "In terms of the ultimate loss rate, it\u2019s hard to predict. I think the way I look at loss rates, are we getting paid for the risk that we\u2019re taking. So is my credit margin increase outpacing my loss rate increase? And that's the way I tend to look at loss rates.",
            "Clearly, in the private label business, as opposed to a general purpose credit card, you\u2019re going to get higher loss rates, but you\u2019re also going to get higher yields, so one would have to go a paid for the risk and that\u2019s kind of the way I look at the organization.",
            "I feel very comfortable with our underwriting process and procedures here, and the focus we have working with our card members, not only to get through difficult times, but also to get through business-as-usual times."

On the yield outlook, as we think about the second half, how should that cadence work as forbearance eases up and the payment holidays ease and we start recognizing late fees again? Can you give us a little sense little sense for whether the 20.4% likely represents a bottom and how that might trend near term?"

And let\u2019s break it down a little and I\u2019ll take the easier portion. The yield, the one third of that, that\u2019s a function of the Fed discount rate, that\u2019s going to stick with us for the rest of the year.",
            "But as we get back to the forbearance effect and the payment effect on the two thirds of that 350 basis point drop, I think as people start coming out of the forbearance programs and we saw the forbearance down dramatically by the end of the quarter, you\u2019re going to see people start paying those late fees again.",
            "So I could see that mitigating down to half to a quarter of where it was before, meaning that 230, 240 could be 80 basis points. We have not modeled that up. So I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m looking at matching my forbearance to my late fee fields.",
            "And again, it's going to be dependent. People go back into forbearance. We\u2019ll give up to late fees. We can obviously deal with the charge-off, have the benefit of the charge off. But if people come back out, forbearance programs are no longer there. They come out of the skip a pace, we\u2019ll start getting those late fees again."

Given Ms. Greer\u2019s background with kind of co-brand and working with partners and with, I guess, with Ascena, you know, 8%, 9% of the portfolio with retailers in DK.",
            "Do you have any thoughts about sort of the mix of pure private label versus co-brand that you might think is optimal going forward? Is there any desire to perhaps become a little less tethered to the fortunes of specific programs?

But the way I look at it is you do want to balance portfolio. You want a fair amount of PLCC in your portfolio, but you also want a balance of co-brand.",
            "Now each portfolio does a different job for you. So for example, PLCC, the private label portfolios, have higher yield and higher losses, where in the co-brand portfolio, you\u2019ll have higher spend, you\u2019ll have less losses and your yields are a little less.",
            "All that balances out, so, you can take the right amount of risk in each portfolio to drive overall profitability. So I\u2019m not looking for each portfolio to do the same job. I\u2019m looking for each portfolio to do a specific job and how that all fits together.",
            "So, like I said, some of it\u2019s opportunistic on what\u2019s in the marketplace. I think in PLCC, our concentration was apparel. We\u2019re moving our concentration to other types of private label, home and beauty, home design, home improvement, all of which have proved stable throughout this pandemic. So we\u2019re not only diversifying our portfolio between co-brand and private label, we\u2019ll be diversifying that private label portfolio as well."

But actually, we\u2019re seeing that more at like 75% now of people coming out of those programs. And that's obviously a function of the large percent of the folks now that are coming into the skip-a-pay, the shorter-term programs. So it's kind of pretty positive news there.

What I had anticipated, what we hadn\u2019t anticipated was the quick pay down of the receivables on the liability side. And of course, what that meant was the short-term liabilities, the money market accounts, the short-term CDs were, of course, what paid off in, given how much the balance sheet shrunk, we needed to keep the long-dated maturities.

We\u2019re working towards offering that to our customers in a very expedited way. Our product ties are to the BrandLoyalty program, but we certainly will - on our roadmap is certainly buy now and pay later."

But I think probably more importantly is that the retailers want us to have that product is the basket of offerings. It\u2019s a whole lot better if they go across the board with a buy now, pay later, a private label, co-brand. We have that suite and all of them branded with the retailer's name.",

You first wanted - I think you talked a little bit about this in the call, but some moving parts at LoyaltyOne, given your end market trends, but also some of the marketing plans you guys had considered originally with lots of live events that unfortunately have been disrupted. So maybe can you just give us a little bit more information about your outlook for LoyaltyOne and your strategic intentions for that division?"

So obviously, they\u2019re fairly - there are two different kind of groups that we\u2019ll have there that we talked about - you end up having, which is the grocery channel, which is fairly ongoing. Those will come back as we need to -- as our grocers need us to drive people back into the stores.",

And then the other side of that business is going to be very event-related, the Olympics, any type of event like that. And that clearly is going to be dependent upon, again, the pandemic and once you see those come out. And I think your second question was around long-term plan with those different divisions?"

Is there more of an outreach to digital channel partners or are they more physical retailers? Maybe just some color on that side."

I think those are the three things we look at and do the partners have that. And our focus is to help the partner and then help the customer transact in any channel that they wish to, whether it is traditionally - a traditional store, whether it\u2019s online, whether it\u2019s a combination of both. So that\u2019s the way we look at our partnership pipeline."
