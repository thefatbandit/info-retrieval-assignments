         "Thanks, Mark. Although we have now completed the spinoff of our Outdoor Products & Accessories business, our filings today represent our first quarter which ended on July 31. Therefore, our Form 10-Q which was filed this afternoon reflects results that includes the spun off business in our operating results. ",
         "Beginning with our second fiscal quarter, the Outdoor Products & Accessories business will be reported as discontinued operations. The significant increase in consumer demand that started in the middle of March continued throughout our first quarter and led to total combined company revenues of $278 million, a $154.3 million increase or more than double the prior year results. ",
         "This increase was driven by a $134.4 million or a 141% increase in firearm revenues resulting in a record first quarter firearm segment revenue of $230 million. These incredible results are a testament to our operations management team that increased firearms production output utilizing a combination of targeted headcount increases and continued activation of our flexible manufacturing model, all while keeping our employees safe during the pandemic. ",
         "Total company gross margin of 42% was 3.3% higher than the prior year on improved volume in both segments. ",
         "Turning now to a discussion of just the Firearm segment, which generated margins of 40.2%. Increased unit shipments, combined with a reduction in promotional activity and only slightly offset by pandemic-related cost resulted in a 3.1% increase in gross margins over the prior year. ",
         "In June of last year, we began reporting the Federal excise tax change in our revenue and now that it has been in place for a full year. This will be the last time we reference that in comparison to a prior year quarter. This change, if applied to the fiscal 2020 quarter would have had a $4 million impact on revenues and a negative 1.5% impact on gross margin to that prior year quarter. ",
         "Total company operating expenses were $4.6 million higher than the prior year due to $3.6 million of spin-off costs and $2.8 million of increased profit sharing expense. Increased volume related customer allowances were more than offset by reduced travel, lower advertising costs and lower employee medical costs, likely due to the deferral of elective procedures resulting from the pandemic. ",
         "The increase in revenue in gross margin led to a significant profit gain as compared to the prior year comparable quarter including net income of $48.4 million, GAAP earnings per share of $0.86, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.97, and adjusted EBITDA of $84.2 million. ",
         "During the quarter, we generated $83.5 million in cash from operations and spent $7.6 million on capital equipment leaving $75.8 million in free cash. We also repaid $135 million on a revolving line of credit leaving $25 million outstanding on the revolver and zero net debt. ",
         "After the end of the first quarter, as part of the spin-off process, we restructured a credit facility for a new five year term that enables us to maintain an unsecured $100 million line of credit for this foreseeable future. ",
         "With that, operator, can we please open the call to questions from our analysts. "
      ],
      "Mark Smith": [
         "Thank you, Rob and thanks everyone for joining us. First, let me recap for everyone our response related to COVID-19. From the onset of the pandemic, we have taken aggressive and decisive action to ensure the health and safety of our employees, while continuing to operate our business in this challenging environment. ",
         "All of the safety precautions we spoke about on our last call, which we put in place in March and April are still in effect today. Those include travel restrictions, staggered shifts, enhanced cleaning and sanitizing, required social distancing, use of face masks, temperature screening, modified production lines, and many other changes to our workflow and daily operations, all designed to mitigate any virus spread.",
         "In addition to keeping our employees safe, these actions have allowed us to continue operations and also give back to our community. Over the past six months, we have produced and donated tens of thousands of sets of PPE for medical professionals, and frontline personnel in our community and we are still accepting and delivering donation requests. ",
         "We continue to monitor daily developments with the corona virus pandemic and stand ready to make any adjustments as needed. ",
         "I\u2019ll now turn to our first quarter performance. I am very pleased to report that despite the enormous challenges presented by the pandemic, our team has delivered a record-breaking quarter in firearm sales. Our firearm segment revenue of $230 million represents shipments of more than 584,000 units, both of which are new records, representing milestones in the history of our great company that our employees should be extremely proud of.",
         "This achievement clearly demonstrates our ability to rapidly respond to increased demand through our flexible manufacturing model and our state-of-the-art distribution facility. We believe these strong quarterly results have also translated into long-term market share growth. ",
         "But before we go through those numbers, two quick notes; first, as a reminder, adjusted NICS background checks are generally considered to be the best available proxy for consumer firearm demand at retail. ",
         "However, since NICS is a measure of consumer activity and since we transfer firearms only to law enforcement agencies, and federally licensed distributors and retailers, not directly to end-consumers, NICS does not directly correlate to our shipments or market share in any given time period we believe mostly due to inventory levels in the channel. ",
         "Secondly, as you recall, we have three main consumer sales channels, distributor, strategic retailer or SRA and buying groups. In the past, we have only provided distributor inventory levels. Going forward however, in order to provide more insight into our business, we will now provide quarterly channel inventory totals that include both strategic retailer and distributor inventory levels. ",
         "Additionally, we will break down channel inventory into long guns and handguns, whereas historically, we have only provided inventory totals. ",
         "So with that, continuing on with market share. In our fiscal Q1, overall NICS Background Checks increased 111% over the comparable timeframe last year. For Smith & Wesson, total units shipped into the sporting goods channel during this time increased 114% to 549,000 units, while simultaneously, our SRA and distributor combined inventory declined by over 112,000 units. ",
         "Breaking that number down a little further, NICS check for handguns increased 141% during the quarter. Our handgun unit shipped increased by 122% to 441,000 units, while simultaneously, our handgun channel inventory dropped by 103,000 units. ",
         "And finally, NICS checks for long gun increased 96% in the quarter, while our long gun units shipped increased 89% to 108,000 units, while simultaneously, our long gun channel inventory dropped by nearly 9,000 units. ",
         "This all translates to a 58% decline in channel inventory for our products in spite of a record quarter in unit shipments from our facilities, which we believe indicates very strong market share growth. Our internal finished goods inventory also declined by almost 48% or $28 million during the quarter. As we\u2019ve seen before during these surge periods, these results reflects that despite our record numbers in market share growth, consumer demand for our products during the quarter still exceeded our internal manufacturing capacity levels. ",
         "This again highlights the unique benefit provided by our flexible manufacturing model. You may recall that we have referenced this model in prior calls. This allows us to capture the benefit of sudden increases in demand without incurring long lead times and the high cost of adding manufacturing infrastructure that has been idled when demand decreases. ",
         "As we discussed on our last call, we have fully reengaged our third-party component manufacturing partners and are aggressively ramping production to meet incoming orders and this ramp continues today. Further, we were able to utilize our state-of-the-art distribution center to deliver products more efficiently and rapidly than ever before. ",
         "Moving now to our go-forward plan that we have been speaking about for the past few quarters; as you are aware, we successfully spun-off our Outdoor Products & Accessories segment last week and we have now returned to Smith & Wesson\u2019s heritage as a pure play firearms company with a focus on organic growth, to returning excess capital to our stockholders. ",
         "I am therefore very excited to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized the company to declare a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share. Our first quarterly dividend will be payable on October 1st to shareholders of record as of September 17th. ",
         "Before I hand the call over to Deana for the financial highlights, I just wanted to speak about a tremendous program that our sales and marketing teams have launched in the last few weeks. The current increase in consumer demand for firearms is in many ways unparalleled. ",
         "A recent poll of firearms retailers conducted by NSSF estimates that between 40% to 60% of the consumers purchasing firearms are first time gun owners who are looking to exercise their second amendment rights to protect themselves and their families. Since March, the NSSF estimates that nearly 5 million Americans have purchased their first firearm. ",
         "Not only are we seeing record new consumer entrants in the markets, but those new entrants are serving to broaden and diversify the core base of firearms consumers with the two fastest growing segments of new gun owners being women and African Americans. In light of this new surge, and as part of our continued commitments to safe and responsible gun ownership, we have launched an innovative, nationwide outreach campaign called GUNSMARTS. ",
         "We have three goals with this program. First, welcome these new gun owners to our industry. Second, make sure they know how to safely use and store their firearms; and finally, provide instructional resources from Smith & Wesson on increasing shooting proficiency, help them understand the basics of firearms functions and help them locate welcoming hands on training, ranges, and other resources, everything a first time gun owner would want to know, but may not want to ask. ",
         "GUNSMARTS is the only program of its kind on the market today. Using the very top professional shooters and instructors in the industry, we have produced over 60 instructional online videos and tips to help convey best practices, all regardless of the brand of firearm purchased. ",
         "Further, we are providing free of charge, and again, regardless of the brand of firearm purchased, a welcome kit to new gun owners that includes Smith & Wesson branded safety glasses, hearing protection, instructional booklets and a link to our online platform containing the video library. This program launched in mid-August and by mid-September, we will have donated over 40,000 GUNSMARTS boxes to new gun owners. ",
         "In collaboration with other industry partners, GUNSMARTS will also offer several sweepstakes over the next few months to keep our new consumers engaged. As an industry, and as a company, we are dedicated to safe and responsible gun ownership and we are proud to be able to welcome these new gun owners to our community. Please visit www.smith-wesson.com/gunsmarts to see the program tools for yourself. ",
         "And with that, I will turn the call over to Deana. "

         "As many of you may know, on August 24, 2020, the company completed the previously announced spinoff of its Outdoor Products & Accessories segment. Therefore, first quarter fiscal 2021 represents the final period in which our financial results will include the Outdoor Products & Accessories segment. On the call today, we are going to focus primarily on our firearms business. ",
         "Joining us on today\u2019s call are Mark Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Deana McPherson Chief Financial Officer. ",
         "With that, I will turn it over to Mark."

         "Remarks": [
            "Maybe just this talk about the market share, again, I guess, kind of like what we saw last quarter, you are speaking to the fact that NICS and your shipments were, I guess, your numbers were within in line to the fact that, distributors are working down on your inventory. I just wanted to make sure if that\u2019s still \u2013 is that\u2019s what you are trying to get at? "

      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. If you remember last quarter, we are actually talking about the SRAs that really drove that difference in NICS and inventory. So, I mean, obviously, it\u2019s just a mask down. So the NICS obviously is a measure of what\u2019s happening at the counter with the consumer and we have that \u2013 we have our three channel partners, our three channels in between us and our shipping dock and what\u2019s happening at the counters. ",
            "So, the major driver we believe of difference between our results and NICS results is what\u2019s happening with the inventory in the channel. So during that timeframe, if you recall from that earnings call, we had a significant increase \u2013 sorry, significant decrease in inventory at one of our SRA accounts. ",
            "So therefore they were not replenishing from us whereas this time, we\u2019ve had significant decreases in inventory across the board internally at all the channels and we are still obviously, as you can see from the results, pretty heavy on shipments which tells us that this is significant \u2013 you kind of got to add those numbers together to get what our true, kind of flow through was.

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. And going forward, obviously, you guys have a very favorable set up utilizing outsourcing and stuff like that. But how are you seeing the picture for the next few quarters? Do you think you can easily keep up with demand? Or will they get to be a point where you are not able to close that gap what you are seeing on the inventory side? "

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I don\u2019t want to get too much in the forward-looking statements and I think, just directionally we can talk about history and what\u2019s happened before in the past. When we get into these surge environments like this and as you can see from the NICS results, we have never seen one quite this high. The demand in the industry in general, this outstrips the industry\u2019s ability to supply and we are no different. ",
            "So, when that, the industry goes through cycles that we\u2019ve talked about for years and you are seeing so, one that \u2013 when that \u2013 how that turns around and when it turns around, I guess, we are not going to \u2013 I guess, speculate about what those drivers are going to be. ",
            "But again, we are very, very well set up as you mentioned with our flexible model to continue increase and we are \u2013 I mean, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are continuing to increase today. There does come a point though where that\u2019s \u2013 there is only so much we can do. And whether that\u2019s going to meet the demand or not and I guess, we\u2019ll see. "

I think, even though we do have a very flexible model, you got to remember that, where the lead time for making a firearm is long in terms of it\u2019s not noted in weeks, it\u2019s noted in months. And so, a turn up in manufacturing and CNC capacity will translate into a finished good coming off of the line. It\u2019s going to be \u2013 if you are looking at somewhere in six to eight week kind of timeframe. ",

But you are right, we are pushing that the \u2013 we are going to go to maximum capacity and I think you can kind of think of that like what we did in the first quarter, you took $28 million out of internal inventory, we will replace. You got to think about that in terms of sales value, not that\u2019s cost. ",

The surge is really not \u2013 I mean, yes, of course, there is some portion of the surge that\u2019s related to gun control regulation fears.

You can \u2013 as you can see in the investor presentation that think we filed on back in July and we\u2019ve spoken with some of you about during one of these surges, we expect our CapEx to be somewhere in the $20 million to $25 million range, but it could be $10 million to $12 million of surge capacity that we add during one of these periods, if and when it makes sense.

Given your business has been violently cyclical in terms of swings over the years, how do you think about doing share repurchase? I mean, how does that fit into your deployment thinking at what point would you say, okay, now we got to buy or how do you think about that?"

But I mean, it\u2019s directionally, I mean, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any kind of a rocket science that if we think the shares are undervalued, we are going to push for a share repurchase. So, and \u2013 that is definitely one of the options that\u2019s on the table. ",
            "But in terms \u2013 but specifically how we end up treating some future excess cash if we end up in that situation, really I that\u2019s going to be a Board decision. We very much are looking for predictability around our dividends. ",

And on share repurchases, then that\u2019s definitely one of the things that\u2019s at the top of the list. We are evaluating if we think the shares end up being undervalued. "

We\u2019ve talked a number of times about how many sort of new consumers there are purchasing firearms, I think the number that you mentioned in the prepared remarks, 40% to 60%, obviously a pretty wide range there in terms of what portion of sales this year or maybe that was since March were first time gun owners.
