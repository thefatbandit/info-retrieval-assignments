      "Ian Smith": [
         "Hi, everyone, good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin by recognizing that we are all truly proud and grateful to our Clearwater employees. They are leading with courage, integrity, responsibility, and with their hearts. They continue to protect themselves, their co-workers and families and work tirelessly to support a safe and reliable global food supply chain under what we all know are extraordinary conditions.",
         "2020 began with a great business momentum and promise like we came out of 2019. However, the impact of the pandemic on the first half of 2020 has been significant and complex for our customers, our supply chain partners, our company and our employees.",
         "The impact of COVID-19 expanded globally in the second quarter to impact all sales regions and most of our species. And the measures that we quickly implemented in the first quarter of 2020 have been successful in protecting the health and safety of our employees. We've managed harvesting, processing and procurement to align with consumer demand, strengthening our ability to remain in continuous operation at sea, on land and around the globe.",
         "Our customer relationships remain very strong and continue to provide critical insight into understanding regional markets and have facilitated specific COVID-19 responses tailored to these markets.",
         "I'm pleased to tell you that demand improved in the latter part of the second quarter and particularly in the month of June, and is expected to improve further as government's relaxed measures and markets continue to reopen.",
         "We have responded by placing extra focus and attention on the expansion of global distribution, new products and formats and increasing promotional activity in channels that are experiencing heightened demand, including retail and e-commerce. We also continue to prepare for and are already seeing local recovery in food service channels.",
         "Clearwater access to capital and our liquidity position remains strong. Adjustments to reduce spending and capital expenditures and operational changes, the inventory and procurement plans as well as temporary changes to our dividend policy and access - as well as access to governments support programs have all helped to preserve cash and leave us in a confident position through the balance of 2020.",
         "We have taken these necessary steps to be well positioned as we move into the second half of the year and believe that we're again well positioned to weather current economic conditions and take advantage of future growth opportunities as global seafood demand continues to recover.",
         "I'll now turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Teresa Fortney to give you more detail."
      ],
      "John Lane": [
         "Thank you, Veronica and hello everyone and welcome to Clearwarter's Q2 2020 earnings call. As we began, I'd like to recognize that we are in Bedford Nova Scotia in Mi'kma'ki the ancestral and unseeded territory of the Mi'kmaq, who have been living on these lands since time in Memorial. And that this recognition is a small but meaningful step in reconciliation and the continued efforts to build a strong nation-to-nation relationship.",
         "As Veronica noted, my name is John Lane, the company's Treasurer and with me are Ian Smith, Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Fortney, Chief Financial Officer; Christine Penney, Vice President, Sustainability and Public Affairs; and Donald MacNeil, Assistant Treasurer. This call is intended to provide information to Clearwater investors. We have also scheduled a media call at 3:30 Atlantic Time, and we will be delighted to take questions from media at that time.",
         "Earlier today, we issued a news release that provided the full details of our second quarter results. For the purpose of this call, we have assumed that participants have reviewed this information, which is also located on our website at www.clearwater.ca. Therefore, during this call we will focus on the more significant points from this release.",
         "Please note that during today's call, management may make forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including without limitation, statements regarding future plans and objectives of Clearwater, constitute forward-looking information that involves various known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors outside of management's control. Forward-looking information is based on a number of factors and assumptions used to develop such information, but which may prove to be incorrect.",
         "Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, total allowable cash levels, selling prices, weather, exchange rates, fuel and other input costs. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.",
         "More information on risk factors applicable to Clearwater, please refer to Clearwater's continuous disclosure materials filed from time-to-time with securities regulators, including but not limited to, Clearwater's annual reports, quarterly reports and annual information form. Finally, the forward-looking information included in this call is made as of the date of this call, and Clearwater does not undertake to update publicly or revise forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities laws.",
         "I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Ian Smith for an opening statement. Ian?"

      "Operator": [
         "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Clearwater Seafoods Incorporated Investor Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Tuesday, August 11, 2020.",
         "I would now like to turn the conference over to John Lane. Please go ahead."
      ],
      "Teresa Fortney": [
         "Thanks Ian. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks again also for joining us. So our second quarter sales and our adjusted EBITDA were $106 million and $18.9 million respectively. And that compared to $153.9 million and $30.3 million in the prior year, due to the global impact of COVID-19. Year-to-date sales and adjusted EBITDA were $206.3 million and $32 million respectively, compared to $274 million $50.3 million in the prior year.",
         "Gross margin and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales were 17.4% and 17.9%, respectively in the second quarter, and that compared to 20.5% and 19.7% in 2019. Leverage increased moderately to 5.3 times, compared to 5.2 times in the second quarter of 2019. The company is continuing to advance the strategic review process with its financial advisors to identify, review and evaluate a broad range of potential strategic alternatives available to it, with a view to continuing to enhance shareholder value. No timeline for this process completion has been currently defined.",
         "Sales volumes decreased across most species and regions in the first half due to lower demand in food service, partially offset by traditional retail and e-commerce demand, which continues to thrive in this difficult market.",
         "In the quarter, lower demand for clam, lobster, and langoustines and higher costs related to COVID-19 were partially offset by lower harvesting costs for scallops and clam, lower fuel costs, continuous improvement program savings, refined procurement strategies and government support programs.",
         "Cash used in operation was $6.9 million in the second quarter of 2020, as compared to $35.6 million in the same period of 2019. Free cash outflow was $18.8 million as compared to $48 million in the second quarter of 2019, and that was due to lower investments in working capital, which can partially offset by lower cash earnings and higher capital expenditures.",
         "The rigorous, cash preservation measures were implemented during the first half of the year, including operational adjustments to several species that significantly improved cash flows, will have a minimal impact on species profitability. Clearwater will continue to use cash preservation measures into the second half of the year to manage leverage and liquidity. We expect to generate positive free cash flow in fiscal 2020.",
         "Leverage at the end of the second quarter at 5.3 times, compared to 5.2 for the same period in 2019. And the lower impact, sorry - the impact of lower demand from COVID-19 was largely offset by disciplined working capital management and strong 2019 results included in the trailing 12-month calculation, which overall resulted in lower net debt balances.",
         "Leverage is expected to increase in the third quarter, as our normal seasonal cycle and as a direct impact from COVID-19. With a global economic recovery in the second half of 2020, we could see leverage decrease by the end of the year from current levels.",
         "The company's ability to operate safely and continuously throughout the pandemic has helped us to support the financial well-being of our employee, supported hundreds of workers in the fishery sector and their communities, and has ensured the availability and delivery of safe and nutritious seafood to our customers locally, nationally and internationally.",
         "While the short-term impacts of COVID-19 has introduced additional forward looking uncertainty, Clearwater is a vertically integrated greatest seafood company with proprietary licenses, advanced in year round harvesting and processing capabilities, our premium product quality, the diversity of our species, our global sales and distribution footprint, and an experienced and dedicated workforce has positioned Clearwater to take advantage of future growth opportunities as global seafood demand continues to recover.",
         "We are now ready to take questions."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hi, Ian. On the China sales, I think they're down close to 50% in the quarter. I know this is a hard question to answer, but what is the impact of the salmon COVID outbreak and maybe restrictions around seafood generally play in that role? And can you maybe tell us where that China's sales number is trending today, I guess closer to early August?"

         "Speaker": "George Doumet"

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah, I think it's clearly hard to say what the future is going to look like in China. But I can tell you that, like in the rest of the world, our demand in China continues to improve. There are no known cases of contamination of COVID-19 via contaminated food or water. And based on the current scientific knowledge of COVID-19, it's considered unlikely that infection from food or water can occur.",
            "Seafood like any other surface may potentially become contaminated if adequate food handling and sanitation measures are not in place, or when handled by an infected person. Additionally, media attributions of a local outbreak to seafood sources, as I think you're alluding to could adversely affect demand for products in the seafood industry. And government control measures everywhere, including China continue to evolve.",
            "We continue to take effective action in this area, around securing the health of our employees and making sure that our products are safe. It's what we do every day. And again, like other markets, China's been traditionally skewed towards food service. So it's had a deeper impact. I would say interestingly, the rest of Asia is held up pretty well. And we see demand continuing to improve. And we see that in our current order patterns as well, not just in China but in many other countries around the world."

         "Speaker": "George Doumet"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So great question George, and we are expecting that we're going to qualify for some wage subsidies, with the change in the program that was announced by the government. Just several weeks back, they changed this process now to be a sliding scale relative to your sales. So it's a little bit hard to say what we'll be eligible for until we actually see how our monthly revenues flow."

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "None. And to qualify that... sorry, I'll qualify that by saying it's taking longer to do things that we would normally be doing in person just because of restrictions on in person meetings and travel and so on. So I'd say that."

         "Remarks": [
            "Just a quick clarification on for free side, I think you mentioned free cash flow is expected to be positive. I think last quarter, you might have alluded that free cash flow this year is going to be higher than last year. Is it just positive or do you still expect to have free cash flows generation above 2019 levels this year?"

      },

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. I was wondering if you could talk about, there's obviously this decided pivot around the world to food at home from dining out. And I was wondering if you can talk about how your organization pivoted to more retail products, whether it's in innovation and in total volume of sales? And what cost impact, whether its operating cost and or capital cost impact does that have in the most recent quarter."

         "Speaker": "Bryan Hunt"
      },
      "20": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So I'll begin at the end of your question, so I would say that the cost impact has been nominal. So if you look at the first half of the year, I would say on a price per pound impact of our shifting that's been going on, it's in the single digits.",
            "And as demand has improved since really the end of April, demand has improved, sales have improved and prices have improved. So prices have not - so prices were modestly affected, but they're not being affected now, despite the heightened demand in non-food service channels, which continues to grow.",
            "We tend to have more premium price shellfish items. The types - the best way to try to explain it to you, there's all kinds of different ways to get into and I'll focus on retail for a moment. So first of all, we have a number of customers that we deal with directly and we've simply been increasing sales to them.",
            "We've essentially not sold all that we could potentially sell to those retailers because we have constrained volume relative to sustainability. So we like to spread it around. But there's fewer places to spread it. And so we've been doing more business with some of our key Canadian and North American retail customers directly. That's number one.",
            "Number two is, we have a number of foodservice distributors both in North America and Asia and in Europe that are multichannel distributors, and they are shifting as well. So our ability to get our products into retail is enhanced by having really good distributors who have strong exposure to retail channels. And they're making the pivot for us.",
            "We also have distributors and customers who are on the processing side, who have made their own pivots to retail and are making more value-added products. And then there's the thing that we're doing on our own. So, for example, we're packing products for retail customers that are going straight to frozen or chilled or i.e. fresh sachet. So with the seafood counters closed in a public store, you can still find our products. And by the way, there's seafood counters are back open.",
            "But back in April, if they were closed, you could you could find Clearwater's scallops in the chilled section. So non frozen, you can always find them in the frozen section. But if the counter wasn't open, you could find them in one of the coolers in the seafood section of the perimeter of the store, chilled in a grab and go package.",
            "We've also through mostly through customers who are doing value added processing, done more retail friendly packs, and those packs have been for their e-commerce business as well as for retail more kind of single serve, double serve, grab and go. We've had new listings with the online stores for all the major retail players and we've also expanded distribution with players like Ocado in the UK. So, that's essentially how we moved and the impact of packaging and additional costs relative to the cost of the product itself has been nominal."

         "Speaker": "Ian Smith"
      },
      "21": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So, just two quick questions, and I'll be done. You talked about retail and e-commerce has been your focus. Can you tell us what your retail sales and your ecommerce sales were up year-over-year in Q2?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Bryan Hunt"
      },
      "22": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So, it's hard to say because we're direct and indirect. And we don't we can't give you with precision. We're not really - we don't release with precision. We don't release what we're selling directly to individual major retail customers and our multi-channel distributors it's really hard for us to pin down what's going into retail which is versus e-com versus food service.",
            "But we do know that our retail so anecdotally, I can tell you that our retail sales are up pretty consistent with where how far retail is up if you take the North American market, so our retail sales anecdotally would be out in the 30% to 40% range versus prior year."

         "Speaker": "Bryan Hunt"
      },
      "24": {
         "Remarks": [
            "No, that's consistent with where we are continuing to forecast. We've removed our discretionary spending. But that $30 million to $35 million is going to continue to give us what we need to stay fully operational and efficient in the fleet in our facilities and had some a creative strategic project still included in there as well."

      "28": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Hi, guys. First of all, Teresa, can you just walk through how we accounted for the $5 million of wage subsidies? How does that flow through the income statement?"

         "Speaker": "Doug Cooper"
      },
      "29": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So, interesting question, and it's, we broke it down and had to have a look at what was what was the support for the government wage subsidy. So, to the extent that and we would have qualified for wage subsidies related to all of our Canadian employees, and so many of those employees are in our operations and the fleet operations and the land base operations.",
            "And so any of the wage subsidies received for that would have been capitalized and included into inventory and is released as that product is sold. And then at any wage subsidies that were associated with salaried folks who would be in flowing through to say SG&A. The cost would have been realized in the period in which they worked. There's not an easy formula to go there."

      },
      "30": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, I guess I'm just trying to get it was that the called $16 million in shareholder EBITDA already? Was that included in the $5.1 million? Is that included in that or and if it was, is there any offset that there was a onetime cost associated with COVID that you had to undertake in the quarter, whether it's for screens or PPE, or anything else increased wages to get people to come that kind of stuff?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Doug Cooper"
      },
      "31": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So, for the total first half the year we have incremental costs associated with COVID of $5.7 million. And we would have had that $5.8 million. And we would have had wage subsidies in our P&L that would have offset $5.1 million of that. So, first half of the year, we would be tracking point $0.7 million less than subsidies and costs."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Teresa Fortney"
      },
      "32": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And the effects of those, we call it onetime cost or anymore this might be the new way of life, but to continue or in the plant or the ships, putting flexiglas up or whatever maybe keeps the workers safe and all that sort of done. Do you expect any ongoing costs in terms of PPE or anything like that?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Doug Cooper"
      },
      "33": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So, I'll answer that in two parts. So, all of the right things that we've been doing in the vessels and we're continuously looking at making sure we can even do further enhancements for the safety of our employees.",
            "Having said that, we're also forecasting that the costs associated with it are certainly a large part are over, but there are still some costs that are continuing for the year. Got to remember that, those costs in the plants and the fleet will cycle through inventory and then come out as we sell the products but, a good chunk of costs, we had incremental costs as an example, where inventory values would have been impacted in the first quarter based on the onset of COVID with market prices resetting, so some of those costs would have been more than one time in nature and not recurring.",
            "So overall, some more cost to flow. We start with or are continuing with thank you paying to our employees. And so, but certainly much lower than what we've been incurring so far."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, just moving on to the outlook. How do you feel about your inventory levels looks like about just $190 million, Q2 a year ago is $120 million? How do you feel about the rebound in the second half and maybe how should we think about the second half this year versus second half last year in terms of percentage change anticipate sort of being at 80% of last year or higher or any sort of qualitative factor outlook you can give us would be great?"

         "Speaker": "Doug Cooper"
      },
      "35": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. I'll take that. So, as I alluded to earlier, demand and sales continue to improve since the end of April, we've had a successful shift in sales, the channels experienced heightened demand, especially retail but also e-commerce.

            "Uncertainty persists, largely associated with countries making continued progress on reopening and economic recovery. But based on our customer demand and order patterns, we're cautiously optimistic, with some species having already fully allocated demands for the second half of the year.",
            "And we expect species with more traditional exposure to food service like lobster as an example, to be more impacted through the balance of the year. From an inventory standpoint, we have very good visibility to our order patterns and long customer histories and a very robust forecasting system. And we have recurring to demand and where we see some potential anomalies from inventory perspective, whether it's the end of the quarter, the end of the year.",
            "It's the phenomenon of timing of landings. The animals don't know when the quarter end happens, as you've heard me say before. So, any blips out of - at the species level in inventories will be associated with timing of landings, not demand or procurement, but with our own harvest."
