         "Thank you so much Gabriel. On slide 9, we show the evolution of total inflation. As of June 2020, the year-over-year increase inflation has been 42.8%. While during the second quarter of the year it has been 5.4%.",
         "Regulated prices have increased 55.2% year-over-year and remaining flat during the second half of 2020, thus generating an increase in journey [ph] inflation index. The breakdown that we're including shows that the most important way in the index comes from food and beverage, transport and clothing among other items, while the share of communication service in the CPI amounts to a very low percentage, which is 2.8%.",
         "Going to slide 10 for the first half of 2020, consolidated revenues on nominal terms grew by 43%, reaching almost P$125 billion. When analyzing set figure, adjusted by inflation revenues amounted to more than P$131 billion, showing a decrease of 3% in real terms.",
         "The Company has been trying to offset inflation impact on its revenues and costs. Service revenues showed a 45% nominal increase while mortgage revenues grew more than 8% in real terms when comparing the first half 2020 with the first half of 2019.",
         "In the case of paid TV, revenues related to local soccer league programming have not been generated, considering that activity has been suspended. EBITDA increased by 54% year-over-year in nominal terms, thus generating an EBITDA margin of 34% -- 37%.",
         "EBITDA margin in real terms was 36.5%. The company performed well in terms of cost controls. Operating costs before D&A decreased to almost 7% in real terms versus the first half of 2019.",
         "The Company performed an effective cost management and almost all cost lines experienced a decrease in real terms with the exception of interconnection and distribution costs, which increased mainly due to the rise in FX rates, and bad debt expenses that were higher as a consequence of the general economic situation.",
         "In slide 11, we show the company's EBITDA and the impact of the different components of revenues and costs. It was a positive evolution of handset costs will decrease 34% in real terms, mainly by a lower number of sales. Operating costs was 7% lower in real terms.",
         "Operative efficiencies were obtained both in programming and content -- content costs. There were no cost related to the local soccer league because it has been suspended.",
         "Administration costs also registered a good performance, decreasing 9% in real terms, and affiliation expenses remained stable mainly as bad debt expenses included the -- increase above inflation impacted by the deterioration of the general economic contends.",
         "Final result was a 290 bips increasing EBITDA in real terms, when compared with the first half of 2018. In slide 12, show the evolution of our collections and non-performing debts. Collections with digital channels have increased to 65% of total collections from the 50% of surge at the beginning of the year. Additionally, the gap of real collections versus a forecast has decreased substantially.",
         "At the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown, the level was almost 30% added. Currently our collections are at a normal level and very unhappy, possibly influenced by extraordinary collections in our B2B business.",
         "In our second to 2020, non-performing debt in retail business increased mainly due to the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown from 2.4% to 2.7%. Since June, Citron [ph] is moving to more normal levels and has been benefited by the recovery rate of our reduced service clients.",
         "In slide 13, we can see the company's operating income totaled almost P$14.5 billion. The EBIT increase in costs and measuring is explained by a lower increase in D&A and this poses an impairment of fixed assets, vis-\u00e0-vis the increase in EBITDA 4% in real terms year-over-year.",
         "Operating margins reached 11% of consolidated revenues, while in historical fields; the same margin has increased to 24% from 20% in the first half of 2019. Net income in the first half of 2020 decreased more than P$7.6 billion, mainly reflecting FX losses due to the net depreciation of a peso and higher interest expense expenses in FX results.",
         "Slide 14, there's a summary of the company's investments in the first half of the year. Telecom has investment -- invested almost P$34.4 billion, including rights of use of assets, bringing this amount of 34% lower when compared to the same last year's period.",
         "Such decreasing CapEx is mainly explained by a spread lease [ph] to protect the company's cash position. Technical CapEx were mainly composed of installation, installations and customer premise equipment or CPE. The balance was located in network and technology and to our international operations both in Paraguay and Uruguay.",
         "During the second quarter of 2020, more than 39 more sites were deployed. Moreover, we continue to increase the capacity of our HFC network mainly through segmentation of areas focusing particularly in the AMBA region, newer to respond to our customer\u2019s high broadband usage due to the pandemic. 2.47 FTTH and 2.371 gigahertz HFC blocks were enabled.",
         "Additionally, we completed the first phase of our cloud foundation initiative by uploading a set of business applications to the Amazon public cloud. In slide 15, we'll describe our customer generation when comparing the first half of 2020 with the first half of 2019.",
         "During the first half 2020, the break-even free cash flow amounted to approximately US$361 million. The increase in EBITDA and the reduction in CapEx mainly explained the additional US$79 million in free cash flow when compared to the first half of 2019.",
         "Turning to slide 16, we show our key figures for last four months as of June 2020 in constant measuring unit. Company's revenues amounted to more than P$265 billion while the EBITDA amounted to almost P$90 billion.",
         "EBITDA margin was 34%. Our gross debt amounted to P$183 billion as of June 30, 2020. The Company has been able to generate an important amount of cash equivalents having a net debt of P$131 billion, reducing our net debt in real peso terms when compared with 31, December 2019. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was at 1.46 times.",
         "Slide 17 shows the breakdown of our financial debt. Total outstanding debt as of June 30 2020, amounted to almost US$2.6 billion. As mentioned the Argentine Central Bank has not allowed companies to assess the FX market at the official FX rate for commercial finance or debt payments in foreign currency, currency unless they can prove that they do not have any liquid funds outside of Argentina.",
         "This was the main reason why the company decided to initiate a liability management study that will cover in the following slide.",
         "Slide 18 summarizes the latest financial transactions the company has done. On August 3, 2020 Telecom concluded an exchange offer of the standing 6.5% notes due in 2021. Holders validly tendered US$ 362.2 million of notes, due 2021. The acceptance rate was 77.74% high enough to demonstrate our solid grade profile and structure of the exchange offer.",
         "Additional amount of US$135.4 million of notes due in 2025 which we consider to be new money was raised to repay our loan with Deutsche Bank, London Branch and CPPIB Credit Investments, Inc.",
         "In summary, the Company issued US$388.9 million of new amortizing notes due 2025 with an 8.5 semi-annual coupon. Due to the above, the company has considerably optimized its capital structure. Our next step will be to extend them what he says is our multilateral loans and we have already started with this process.",
         "In slide 19, we show our pro forma maturity profile as of June 2020 after the exchange we just mentioned. Our maturities in US dollars are in the range of US$100 to US$500 million between 2021 and 2022, and are reduced until the maturity of 2026 notes.",

         "Fixed voice subscribers without considering IP telephone lines, amounting to 3 million, such though [ph] successful commercial strategies focus on the bundling and upselling of our products, we currently have 1.8 million convergent unique customers with 43% of our broadband customers having a mobile...",
         "We continue with slide five, presenting our new IP transformation projects. During June, with our digital code as part of our package transformation for our products, this has enabled us operate under a unified, convergent and efficient system of processes for the back office.",
         "With the implementation of SAP S/4 for HANA and AREVA, we have accomplished this objective in our operating model. Based on best market practices, it allows us to work in a simpler and more collaborative and transparent way. More than 6000 employees were training through 150 portal [ph] where we have more than 50 -- internal courses.",
         "Regarding our main BSS transformation project \u201cFAN\u201d we have been able to complete the third and fourth migrations of mobile customers adding 2.5 million prepaid and postpaid clients during May and August, respectively.

The share of communication services in the National CPI is approximately be 2.8%.",

         "In addition, there has been a important growth in broadband speed considering that 55% of our total subscribers had speed between 50 and 200 megabytes compared to 80% by the end of last year. Our product flow has delivered solid results. We have almost 1.1 million Flow boxes inside homes that's advancing toward the objective of network digitalization.

         "Both inclusive plans and review services are being provided to clients. In the case of the reduced services, they are only provided to clients who have not paid their service on time.

Among others, in the case of non-payment of three bills by a separate group of clients until the end of September 2020. This was then extended to six bills until December 2020.",
         "As of June 2020, clients with reduced services represent less than 2% of the company's subscriber space, since the Flow have very limited capacity as of June, we are recovering such clients at a rate higher than 60%.",
         "On May 28, 2020 the Argentine Central Bank decided the Company's which have liquid assets abroad must first use their funds to pay their dollars commercial as I mentioned it, thus not allowing the local companies to access the FX market, official FX rate unless they can prove that they do not have any limited funds outside Argentina.",

      "Roberto Nobile": [
         "Hi, everyone. Just to finish the presentation and opening to questions. We just would like to highlight that the COVID pandemia has been like a catalyst for the company in its digital transformation path. Not only because we were able to sustain and hold the operation and the business, but also grow significantly in terms of engagement. If we take a look at Flow, our IP video platform, we reached 9.5 hours of average user per customer. And that's an amazing number considering the volume of transactions that are been passing through our platform. We hit 126 million views. We grew 30% in terms of users on the OTT platform. We grew 66% in terms of hours in VOD on our app, on our OTT platform too. And more than 31% growth of hours in VOD, in our box or setup box video platform also.",
         "We have also been able to keep our transformation project on schedule. As Gabriel was mentioning, we were able to keep running our SAP project. And we have -- today we have all the ledger in one ERP is SAP S/4 HANA, we were able to migrate more than 2.8 million customers -- mobile customers into the new salesforce platform. And that's a great achievement. And we keep on rolling migration waves throughout the year.",
         "We have given the company also a better outlook for 2021and -- 2020 and 2021. Their maturity reducing significantly that they're maturing next year. We have managed cash flow in a very conservative way to deal with a difficult business context to ensure the company [Technical difficulty]."

Can you remind us how many dollars you can actually buy at official FX? Or what is the average FX at which you can buy dollars?"

            "Great. Thank you for a question. Well, on the accounting for the company of all the dollarized assets are accounting using the official foreign exchange rate unless those specific assets might have market price. This is for instance, if a company buys any security, you use the market price of the security or the rest of the dollar assets are accounted at the official foreign exchange rate. Regarding the amount of dollar that the company may get from the local FX market from their move as we call here, theoretically is a limited in terms as far as you comply with the regulations pertaining what type of payment are you willing to make, you go to the market and the market provides mostly with the authorization of Banco Central. The restrictions are based in what type of conditions the payment must meet to be able to be channeled through this market.",
            "For instance, all the financial payments required that the debt should be register prior with Banco Central. All the commercial payments have to meet certain technical relationship between the goods [ph]. For instance, just to explain this in brief. We can go with this more detail in a separate call if you wish. All the goods have been -- you cannot anticipate a significant amount of input.

Really it was very difficult to precise in much this year would be -- what was going to be for the company, the outcome of the pandemia plus all the uncertainty that was derived from the Argentinean negotiation of the day. With a much clearer situation regarding both seizures [ph], Argentina has already reached an agreement on the sovereign debt. And on the other hand, we have a clear picture of how the evolution of the company is behaving with the quarantine process. We decided to retake the original amount of CapEx. And also we are considering some additional amounts regarding some aspects that are related to the new normality, let's call it that way, that might require a different type of attention. At the end, we're seeing that our CapEx will be over $550 million for sure. And very likely over $600 million. All these of course, calculated, as I mentioned, to the foreign exchange rate, which is the one that we effectively account and effectively pay."

That's going to be from September 1st on and that's -- we have already communicated to our customers with one month in advance, because the local law requires us to do that. We have the negotiation with ENACOM that was between the March and August 30 [ph]. That was the timeframe where we have agreed upon freezing, let's say that way, the prices.

We are -- as Fernando explained, we are below that for the time being. We do not think that its going to be a very significant change in that equation. Regarding the next steps to keep up with the maturities, we have already in finance more than $600 million of the maturities, especially next year. And as you saw from the presentation, we have already started negotiations with most of our banking creditors, meaning that, I will say, at this stage, we have reached an informal commercial agreement with our bank. And we still have additional conversations with multilateral agencies to bring on the same package and restructured the rest of the maturities.",
            "Having said that, that will mean, that for the next two-year the company will have reduce the total amount of maturities in half and that is considering the remains of the 2021, note, that we change recently. So, really the situation in terms of a cash flow for the company or requirement of financial dollars for the company has changed significantly and also that implies a significant advantage for local PCR rate too."

      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "What does it mean is that the difference between the two is the FX or the inflation adjusted. A historical value, meaning, with no consideration on inflation has grew of 71%. When you calculate the same amount of operating income related to inflation figures, you have costs that are related to a different base and your income is not necessarily adjusted completely by inflation or by price adjustment that there is in this case. The reality here is can the company during this process went into a very successful I would say cost control. All the situations are becoming digital, as Robert has mentioned. It has -- and having a very significant part of our population working from home. Mean that, for instance, we have five corporate buildings of three of them completely closed and also additional cost savings which are relevant have been taking place as Fernando explained regarding the football [ph]. Also you have a reduction in the sale of devices, which concurrently implies less cost too.",
            "So there are several lines of costs that were very successfully managed. And as a result of that the EBITDA margin grew significantly and operating income also has a good behavior on these? Also remember that 10% of our revenues, which are related to the corporate business, are adjusted by N\u00facleo."

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, part of this is difficult to answer, because it's more related, for instance, to the evolution of foreign exchange rate and some other. And the ability of many suppliers to pass on inflation to us in terms that I will say that, in terms of the improvement of margin that we already have, we think that both at the accounting level, but on the MIS information, we grew about six points of EBITDA margin, which we think that at least three of them will be reduced when the quarantine process reopen. But I think this is my personal opinion. It is yet difficult to say that probably one or two points are going to be there and our intention is to do so. We are really doing a very intensive cost control and learning for the cost reductions that we achieved in this process to keep most of them after this situation changes."

So we don't see any -- even though there are competitors working on the video side, we are performing very, very well. And that's not a problem so far. On the Broadband side, we have very strong competition today, that is heating on. We have a really mentioned that in previous talks. We have an HFC Network. That's a Hybrid Coax and Fiber Network where we have HFC Broadband customers. And we have the old copper network where we have xDSL customers.",
            "We are losing and probably we have shown the figures. We are losing customers on the xDSL network, because of their stronger competition with a better product. And we are retaining our market share on our HFC Networks. So as long as we are able to upgrade our copper networks into a FTTH networks, that's part of our CapEx plan for the future. We will be able to increase our market share on those areas. But as long as we don't keep on with a FTTH deployment, that's not possible. So anyone that interrupts in an area with copper network only, it's difficult to compete. So that's probably the way. Most of our customers are on HFC. And on HFC we are growing. And for example, in the last month, we are growing more on HFC that what we are losing on the copper areas."

And 70% of our staff belongs to a union. And we have agreed with the unions, the salary increase and we completed the negotiations. And that was between 40% and 42%, depending on the union.

But on the other side, we were able to deploy 16,000 square blocks of FTTH in Paraguay, especially in [Indiscernible]. And we have hit 100,000 -- more than 100,000 new customers on Broadband on FTTH services. And that's a great job we're doing. We're achieving probably around between 25% and 30% of market share coming from zero. So we are doing a very good job. And we're going to keep doing that."

We brought that money within the country to comply with Banco Central regulation and not other currency is held abroad. As part of the refinancing process that we are currently developing, we have established a structure that has no relationship with a company, while that has paid the cash consideration for the exchange of the bonds. And we'll also a use the funds required for completing the refinancing of our banking debt, meaning that, no additional funds are going to be required from that part.",

But all of that is a held within the boundaries of the country. So what the company did was under this new regulation of Banco Central was use all the funds available to strengthen its balance sheet changing the maturity profile with its creditor. And now we have plenty of cash to operate the company within the boundaries of Argentina."
