      "Olli Isotalo": [
         "Okay. Thank you, Rita. And I\u2019m still at sound check. Simo, can you hear me?",
         "Okay. Good, excellent. So welcome on my behalf as well to this very first half a year review of Neles. This is exciting call, I guess, this is one of those so-called big calls in many respects. But my idea today or our idea, together with Simo, today is to cover three topics.",
         "I will first speak about our first half year and, of course, the second quarter highlights and the results in brief, then Simo will then run through to say \u2013 the bigger points to you in detail. And then finally, I will take the opportunity and to make a kind of a short recap of our recently launched strategy, but maybe taking a bit more execution focus in that part.",
         "At that point, we can go to the first topic and the highlights. Well, I guess it\u2019s fair to say that the first half of the year, from our point of view, it was eventful. We had two major teams that kept us very busy. First of all, of course, the very positive and in many ways, good learning experience to all of us was the partial demerger for Metso and building the new Neles as an independent listed company. It was a lasting one-year long project, which was completed successfully July 1 when the trading started.",
         "The other main topic was not that positive, but that has been then the COVID-19 pandemic with all its implications and all the actions which we then took due force. Our financial performance, especially the underlying operational margins, they were solid regardless of the pandemic situation.",
         "Oil and gas and pulp and paper, our project funnel, generally speaking, it remained active throughout the period. And it\u2019s also visible in our order backlog today, which is stronger than it was at the end of last year.",
         "At the same time, we took a bit more hit on our services and in the maintenance, repairs and operations, MRO-driven and mostly customer OpEx-driven business, because of the mobility restrictions and lockdowns. In that sense, the prices has been different compared in the earlier or to the crisis in the past.",
         "Finally then, Neles Board of Directors that became effect 1st of July, also formally confirmed our strategy. There were no changes made. It was at least still the same strategy. It is very valid, and it was first time communicated in the press release before the Capital Market day in May and then repeatedly in the date itself and then in the numerous investor calls after that.",
         "Post period, important event from strategy point of view and operationally was the opening of our new technology center, the new factory in China. This is our second factory in Jiaxing and close to Shanghai, our first factory and located in Shanghai. They are within 1.5 hour driving distance from each other.",
         "Moving on, looking at the market during first half. We can say that the North American market was, of course, impacted during the second quarter, both by the COVID-19 pandemic but also the overall market sentiment in North America, in our case, varying price in oil, a bit softer fluctuation already at the end of last year due to the trade wars and other issues. And then now during the second quarter, we then saw order impact and really the full impact on all matters. EMEIA, of course an important market area for us, in many ways being the biggest but also quite service-intensive. This was suffering because of the MRO and the services business, more or less. APAC, also of course were impacted because of the same reason. On the other hand, our very strong first half in South America, thanks to mainly pulp and paper projects that we were able to win.",
         "If you look at the curves on the right side, I just would like to make a note that the peak during Q4 2019 was in South America. But also now the clear, let\u2019s say, peak during Q1, and on other hand then the dip in Q2 meant they are such normal fluctuation and the timing of peak project orders received are not reflecting really any changes in the market sentiment or the market situation as such.",
         "Moving our focus to the Q2, the first [Technical Difficulty] for the predominant theme during last quarter was really the focus on our profitability, meaning the cost control, but also protect our customer business. Orders received came quite a lot, down 21% year-on-year; sales, 16%; and adjusted EBITA, 15%.",
         "However, the relative profitability, 16.3% of adjusted EBITA, we are very happy internally. We consider that as a good figure in this uncertain time. That was a consequence obviously countered, both structural and temporary, our cost saving actions very proactively during the Q1. We took a very forward-leading approach in those because of the feeling that this might end up to even worse situation than it\u2019s been at the beginning. But we were prepared for both scenarios. Adjustment items then there during the Q4, they were \u20ac4 million, and they are all related to creation of new Neles, rebranding IT structure and, of course, having the new operating structure in place now open.",
         "Operating profit were impacted by those assortment items and, of course, sales down year-over-year. Earnings per share were \u20ac0.08.",
         "\u20ac39 million free cash flow during Q2. If you look at then the full first half, the markets were mixed in the sense that I already explained. On the other hand, we had a good project funnel. But at the same time, we were suffering on the day-to-day and the services in the MRO-driven business. But obviously because the first quarter was in many ways still almost stabilizing this, orders received came down by 10%.and the sales, 14%. Order backlog at the end of the period was \u20ac305 million, which is 9% from the year-end 2019. Earnings per share, \u20ac0.14, and the cash flow during the first quarter was not equally impressive to Q2, meaning that the average cash flow in H1 was a bit more modest.",
         "A couple of words of COVID-19 and our actions. I think I have covered most of them already. But obviously, we put the employee safety and the protection as the first priority. And we learned \u2013 like many others, we learned the new ways of working. The factories, obviously, they have been operational all the time, and the factory people don\u2019t have the luxury to go to the remote mode like we did globally basically in all our units and offices. That went surprisingly well, and we have learned the new ways to work in many ways.",
         "We also mandate well or actually very well in the supply chain. We had some disturbances, of course, in the beginning of the year with the lockdowns in China, later on lockdowns in Brazil, then later on in India. Currently, all our factories except our factories in India are working almost normal. India, as you know, from the news is still suffering and especially our area where we are located in Mumbai. That is still suffering from the pandemic lockdown situation.",
         "Looking at the market a couple of months ahead. We expect the market activity in pulp and paper projects to continue on a good level. We still have the project funnel there, and we are very actively working with that one. At the same time, we do not see oil and gas project funnel on the same level as it was during the first half of the year, but we expect the decline from the good levels because of the situation of the overall economic concern.",
         "We expect services and MRO-driven business to gradually improve towards the year-end as the restrictions are expected to ease and many customer operations to normalize. We are also learning, as we believe the customers are learning, to work under these conditions, which is also helping the situation. After saying all that, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, of course, continues to create uncertainty and risks in the coming months for the business as well.",
         "If the first half was eventful, I guess it\u2019s fair to say that we can expect the second half to be eventful as well. We have caught a lot of media attention here locally here in Finland, obviously, with the local issue but very much media attention around speculations, share repurchases, public tender offer, et cetera, et cetera. And then obviously, we will organize an Extraordinary General Meeting at the end of October this year.",
         "Good. That was the first section. And Simo, if you take over then and run through the financials in details.",
         "Okay. Thank you, Simo. And then to the final section: strategy update and focus areas. Reinventing reliability is our new customer promise. We are building on our long heritage, experience and know-how, and really our ambition is to develop and to bring to the market new solutions that are redefining how the process industry or industries are experiencing the reliability in flow control.",
         "The confirmed financial targets are reflecting our growth ambition. We are aiming to grow organically, clearly faster than the market. We are aiming to reach around \u20ac1 billion \u2013 more than \u20ac1 billion volumes measured in orders around 2025, except there \u2013 it\u2019s very much depending on the success on the acquisition side, to some degree, also, of course, the recovery from the COVID or the current COVID crisis.",
         "Meanwhile, the growth will take some resources or will require some investments. We are aiming to keep the profitability levels or at good levels over 15% of EBITA while investing to grow but also keeping our balance sheet, that Simo has went through, on a healthy level after \u2013 for these investments and also, of course, to divide the payer share to the shareholders.",
         "The strategy is based on four areas where we see the growth opportunities and three areas, which are more related to the internal operational and cost efficiencies. The growth we are expecting to come by gaining \u2013 continue to gain market share by expanding our sales coverage, both internal and external, both direct and indirect sales channels, but also broadening our product offering, meaning to be able to serve the current core industries better to have more complete product offering but also expand our current core to the new areas.",
         "We are aiming to continue and further accelerate the good growth, actually more than average growth that we have had during last times in valve controls and actuators, the automation part of the valve business, and the stay and to continue the faster than average growth that we have had in our service business. And all these initiatives there and behind these focus areas are supported then by targeting acquisitions to support.",
         "There is no growth without cost, that goes without saying, to mitigate potential negative impact on the growth impact. We have identified some areas: first of all, to make a difference to competition in project delivery capability. It\u2019s one of those areas. That will also help us to improve and optimize our working capital. We opened our new factory in China during the last quarter. And we recently acquired a company in India less than two years ago. Due to the circumstances, we have not been able to fully leverage those \u2013 or that factory that we have in Mumbai. So there is a lot more to be done, both to leverage the new factory in China and the good setup that we have in Mumbai in the coming years.",
         "We have launched cost saving actions, not only the temporary ones, those were COVID related, but especially we are now preparing the permanent structural savings we have set that we want to fully compensate the additional cost of being an independent company, and not only that, but also create room for growth investments, i.e., achieve the most spend in sales coverage and R&D.",
         "Then going to my last slide of my section, a couple of words on the current stages of the strategy execution. The strategy was launched early this year, and we have clearly moved to the execution phase. Of course, COVID is slowing down some activities. We have been able to continue about 70% of the initiatives that are behind these strategic focus areas, either fully not affected or, let\u2019s say, limited impact from the COVID situation. 30% of the initiatives have been put on hold or are significantly impacted at this time point. Of course, short-term savings actions have put a certain limitation on what we can do or are willing to do in these circumstances, what we\u2019ve come to expect. Those are examples of those postponed ones. But they are there, and we are ready to kick them off as soon as we will get clarity how the market will go in the coming months.",
         "Essential part of our current strategy is, of course, to maintain and strengthen the good market positions in those areas where we are strong already today, an example, pulp and paper. I guess the strong success that we have had been winning major projects in this area is an evidence that we are moving to right direction. I don\u2019t have the statistics available yet. My gut feeling says though that we are gaining market share there.",
         "We have made good progress in creating capabilities when we are going to new growth areas. We are in mining and metals today, but it\u2019s not very material. It has been identified to become one of the growth areas. And indeed, we have got first successes in that front as well. We have the new organization and operating model fully implemented by this resource reallocation. I am referring to the permanent structural savings. In clear context, it means that we are \u2013 we have been cutting costs in some areas. Those have been \u2013 some of them have been published like here in Finland. We have done similar moves in the U.S. to create room for growth but, of course, to also to mitigate the additional costs that we got as an independent company. Those have been progressing as planned. Many of them are actually already complete, most of them completed.",
         "I have mentioned already, important going forward is our easyflow offering meaning the product portfolio that we got through with the acquisition that we made 1.5 years ago. Our market position with those products, excluding India, it\u2019s a good stronghold there, but our strategy is obviously expand to the global scale. That has required quite a lot men advising that the COVID has not particularly helped us in the depot. But right now, as we are reporting, we are ready for the global launch going forward.",
         "Good. Thank you. And that was our first interim call."
      ],
      "Rita Uotila": [
         "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Neles half year review briefing. I\u2019m Rita Uotila, Head of the IR at Neles. I am happy to introduce today\u2019s speakers, CEO, Olli Isotalo; and CFO, Simo S\u00e4\u00e4skilahti.",
         "[Operator Instructions] This call will also be recorded and available on demand afterwards on our website.",
         "Without further ado, please go ahead, Olli, with the presentation.",
         "Thank you, Olli and Simo, for the presentation. Now we are ready to go to the telephone lines and to the questions. Operator, please go ahead."
      ],
      "Simo S\u00e4\u00e4skilahti": [
         "Very well.",
         "Olli, we are having a little bit hard time hearing you at times. Okay?",
         "Okay. Thank you, Olli. So starting at the profit and loss statement. As mentioned, the first half profit, our adjusted EBITA was 14.3%, and thanks to a very strong profitability in the second quarter. The sales were low, which is challenging the profitability. However, we reacted early to these issues that were caused by the pandemic. We, of course, kept safety, business continuity and customer cooperation first, but we also took a lot of actions to \u2013 and a strong focus on protecting our profitability and cash flow.",
         "So in the second quarter, our adjusted EBITA was 16.3%. It was a \u2013 there was a small effect of support from low group allocations. But if you just look at also the \u2013 just the underlying kind of business results, it was also on good level in these circumstances. These activities to protect the profitability, they included both kind of structural changes and personnel reductions and reallocation of resources that are driven both by the situation but also by our strategy. But then we also we took kind of short-term cost saving actions, temporary layoffs, work fund reductions and then also looking carefully in all external spend and to make sure that we keep the profitability on a good level.",
         "As mentioned and as well known, in the first half, we carried out successfully the demerger and preparation of the launch of Neles. These costs \u2013 some of these kind of one-off costs that are indicated as adjustment items, altogether \u20ac6 million in the first half and \u20ac4 million in the second quarter, and they are obviously excluded on the adjusted EBITA. So taking this into account, our operating profit is 11.7% of the sales in the first half and 12.6% in the second quarter.",
         "Perhaps one and just a technical note that, as Olli mentioned, the earnings per share for the continuing operations was \u20ac0.14, but then there\u2019s a large booking in the second quarter relating to the completion of the demerger and transfer of the net assets to net Outotec, that will be seen in the group IFRS EPS. Obviously, this is not a cash item and such.",
         "Then moving to the next page, we can see that this sort of kind of a one-page to help people reconcile the numbers. So we have here operating \u2013 operative adjusted EBITA, which is corresponding to the previously reported segment profits. So the difference between that and the group adjusted EBITA is the headquarters and other allocations. And then obviously, there are between group adjusted EBITA and the operating profit, amortization and the adjustments that I just mentioned.",
         "Moving on and looking at the balance sheet. I think the main attention here would be drawn to the kind of the net debt position that was crystallized now at the completion of the partial demerger at the end of June. This net debt position at that time was \u20ac99 million, more or less, yielding a gearing of 39% and net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.0. It should be noted though that this would be impacted by payment of about \u20ac26 million of withholding taxes related to dividends that were already paid in June, and this \u20ac26 million payment has been done already in July.",
         "Moving on and looking a bit closer to the net working capital. I should make a note here that these numbers here exclude \u2013 or are focused on external items and include certain net to internal items. So in the second quarter, there was a lot of \u2013 also emphasis on managing cash flows, collect the receivables and managing credit. We didn\u2019t experience any material credit losses or cancellations \u2013 project cancellations due to COVID and our receivables were reduced during Q2, but inventories still stayed on a high level.",
         "And finally, looking at the cash flow for the first half. As Olli mentioned, that was pretty much concentrated on the second quarter during which it was quite solid. If you look at the investment levels, they were quite high in the first half. One item to note there where there were these investments made for the new Jiaxing factory. It was \u20ac3 million in the period. Going forward, we expect that the full year investment levels to be below last year\u2019s level.",
         "This is kind of in a nutshell our highlights for the financials. So back to you, Olli."

But first, could you give us some color on the trading and how it progressed through the quarter? And sort of what was your organic exit rate you saw in June for equipment and service, respectively? That would be very helpful."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Well, I mean, our services business was negatively impacted as the figures show. So actually, if you look at our sales or order intake and especially the sales figure because in services, the order intake goes almost straight through. And sales, if you look at the sales figures, actually services was anyhow dropping a bit less and then our sales in average. But obviously, MRO-driven part of the business, which is customer kind of OpEx-driven part, includes services. And our day-to-day business was suffering slightly more than the services. But basically, in the big picture, the impact was roughly the same.",

And especially in our case, I mean, in this project business, one month can vary from the other one, even the quarter, in some case, can be a pretty short period. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very relevant how this month is going. The market outlook that we were stating, it\u2019s obviously very valid still, but it\u2019s covering the coming couple of months."

And there, we\u2019ve disclosed the kind of \u2013 some numbers on people that have the positions that have been reduced in the U.S. and Finland. There were also some in other places, too. So that\u2019s, of course, something that\u2019s been done during the second quarter.",
            "Then as mentioned, there were also implemented this kind of more temporary measures on costs, shorter work times, partial or temporary layoffs, et cetera, plus putting some external spending or projects on hold. And they were already contributing to the profitability that you see, despite low volumes, the good kind of relative profitability or the profitability margin. And we will continue with these short-term activities as long as needed until we see that the situation is getting clearer."

If the situation prolongs, we need to take needed structural measures because we cannot kind of beat shorter net working weeks forever or pay cuts forever, et cetera, et cetera. So \u2013 but the plan is really that is already made structural long-term savings. They are now gradually kicking in. Meanwhile, we are gradually then easing up with the temporary setup."

We talk about additional cost around \u20ac6 million. And then we have said that we want \u2013 by the structural savings, we want to fully compensate that, but not only that, also to create room for R&D and the additional cost coming from when expanding the sale coverage."

         "Remarks": [
            "Just my first one is on your oil and gas outlook for the oil and gas end market. Could you talk a little bit about whether your more cautious outlook for the second half is linked to any particular customer group or region? Or is it specifically just taking \u2013 noticing the challenges that are out there. So maybe just a bit of detail, is it midstream transport? Is it refinery? Or is it relatively broad-based?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Good. It\u2019s actually across the geographies, of course. Timing may be a bit different, but really it is directing. As you \u2013 hopefully, many of you know that our exposure to upstream is very, very small. I would all say it\u2019s not material. In our oil and gas exposure, we have been counting also industrial gas including \u2013 to that one. The dynamics in the industrial gas market is a bit different. It\u2019s not necessarily following the rest of the oil and gas because it\u2019s more linked to the industrial activity, generally speaking, in various industries. And that\u2019s actually very important for us.",
            "And then on the refining side, which is, of course, important for us and really the biggest one, there our focus is more on the complex refineries, focusing on more complex products. Not maybe from the figure point of view, very, material, but like our domestic customer Neste here in Finland, focusing very much on biofuel, is a good example. And of course, those are areas that we at least can hope are doing somewhat better than the kind of commodity refineries."

Do you see them being \u2013 or do you see a sort of change in the way that they\u2019re behaving? Have they been more aggressive with that business? Or have you seen the consolidation change?

Would you \u2013 and I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s something you look at, but would you sort of comment \u2013 would there be any comments on the aggregate margins in your order backlog relative to this time 12 months ago? I guess what I want to understand is the pressure on volumes related to COVID, has it had any intensification of pricing dynamics in terms of when you look at the margins in your overall backlog?"

There is more competition or more fight for those projects. So for sure, we can anticipate that there will be some price pressure in that area. We have not faced that that much if you look backwards. But of course, you could expect that to happen. I think some of our competitors were even commenting on that one recently.",

We have been able to keep \u2013 even though naturally in the big projects, there is a tendency that the margins are somewhat lower. That\u2019s also quite almost close without saying.

If we think about your service business and kind of how it\u2019s evolved, through the quarter, do we put the headwinds that you\u2019ve seen in services sales, is it entirely due to people access, ability to get your people to the sites?",

I guess is this cycle any different to what we saw back in 2015 and 2016 in your MRO business, i.e., are the earnings of the customers under pressure? The CapEx cycle, is it more under pressure that may affect that MRO business? Or do we entirely put it down to COVID-19 and it should normalize very quickly as infection rates start to normalize? Is there anything sort of structurally different about this cycle versus, say, 4 years ago?"

Yes for sure, this is different because four years ago and even the one before that, the financial crisis, that hit our, let\u2019s say, CapEx-driven project business actually first. Now this is different because the services and MRO-driven, our day-to-day, that took the first hit.",
            "Then to the question that if everything is because of COVID, I think that is the root course behind everything. That has then triggered like our own cost-saving actions, cash protection actions and so in the customer base. And that is then, of course, impacting indirectly. But I think the root cause there is all the same and our expectation. And then it\u2019s very practical and very concrete because big part of this slowness in the services, in our case, is really postponements of the shutdowns. But as long as industries \u2013 I mean the processes, refineries, pulp and paper mills, as long as they are running as they are, most of them are operational. These shutdowns cannot be postponed forever.",

And oil and gas projects are part of that. So I think that can help you give some idea of that.",

It\u2019s just that visibility indicates that there is that level of activity and that we expect to win. It\u2019s not the same as in the kind of in the next, say, 6 months, and it was in the beginning of the year. But we are not saying that it\u2019s kind of stopping or anything like that."

This is something that we are not actually a specialist that much and not able to answer probably better than you are by yourself or your colleagues there.
