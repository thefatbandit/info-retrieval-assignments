      "James Teague": [
         "Thank you Randy. I said at the beginning of the last call, when we were talking about first quarter earnings, while it was supposed to be an earnings call, I thought it was going to be a COVID call, and that is what it turned out to be. So sticking with that theme, I guess today, we are going to tell you our COVID story.",
         "For the second quarter of 2020, we reported EBITDA of $2 billion compared to $2.1 billion for the same quarter last year. Our DCF I think you saw the press release was 1.6 times coverage and year-to-date we have retained $1.2 billion and something else we are quite proud of is, this is the best first half safety performance that we have ever had at Enterprise.",
         "Given what we have all gone through, as you would expect, our volumes were down as a result of the pandemic and the oil price crash, but they are quickly improving. With all of the events, our results for the second quarter highlighted diversification of our system, the quality of our customers, cost control and the responsiveness of our assets and our employees during what was probably the most challenging quarter of my career.",
         "Our profits were protected by a strong base of firm customer obligations and the natural edge we have and our storage and marketing activities, which enabled us to largely offset the weakness in our natural gas gathering and processing and petrochemical businesses.",
         "The facts are, we are in the commodity service business. For us, both on the supply and demand side of the equation. We transport, store, upgrade and buy and sell multiple energy commodities.",
         "Because we are so tightly integrated, we have a lot of tools at our disposal. When the market says store crude we can. When the market says store diesel, but give me LPG, we convert wells and do so. When the markets say store Y-grade, we store Y-grade.",
         "In addition, our people and our systems have a strong history of performing, no matter the type of crisis and our balance sheet always has the dry powder to move quickly. We usually get the question of how much of our results are non-recurring, and it is the same question we got when Katrina blew through South Louisiana and literally knocked out every plant we had.",
         "Norco was down for months as was Promix, Venice and Neptune. Demand came back before indigenous supply and we made more money with our West to East pipelines than if those plants had been running. So it was non-recurring.",
         "We got that question during Hurricane Ike in 2008, which went right over Mont Belvieu. We had Mont Belvieu back up before producers could even get their supplies back. Got the question in Hurricane Harvey in 2017, when production never stopped, but virtually all of our customers quit taking, in some cases, for months, and we never interrupted a single contract customer.",
         "Events like what we are going through now, and the opportunities they present may be labeled as non-recurring, but our performance and our results are recurring regardless of the environment. We have outlined in today\u2019s earnings release that the petrochemical and refined product service segment was particularly hit hard due to the decrease in demand for those products. However, we remain encouraged by the efforts of most countries to reopen their economies.",
         "In addition to being one of the largest refined products consumers in the world, the U.S. is also a substantial exporter of refined products, especially the Latin America. As you all know, during the second quarter refining utilization rates bottomed in April, which negatively impacted our propylene and octane enhancement businesses due to lower feedstock availability and a decrease in international demand.",
         "Currently the refining industry has recovered to near 80% which has facilitated an improvement in both propylene and octane enhancements. On the production side, our natural gas gathering and processing were impacted by low prices and some shut in production. While those shut ins were not insignificant, for the most part they were relatively short lived and volumes on our system are recovering.",
         "We have made substantial progress in deferring and reducing capital by a billion dollars and we continue to discuss JV opportunities, which could further reduce our capital. In addition, Graham and his folks have reduced 2020 sustaining CapEx by $100 million. That said, we have some important projects coming online over the next few months.",
         "In the third quarter, our 11th fractionator and the ECHO segment of Wink to Webster expected online. And in the fourth quarter, we expect to complete our rich gas pipeline to Carthage, add a DIB at Mont Bellevue and complete a strategic ethylene tank and pipeline build out.",
         "We continue to make strides in our petrochemical segments, which we have always described as an extension of our NGL franchise and our value chain, because we are probably the only midstream that is fairly big in the petrochemical midstream space. It is easy to underestimate the long-term strategic importance of what we are doing.",
         "Rather than being a feedstock starved olefin industry with a handful of players, the United States, especially in ethylene, has quickly moved into being the world\u2019s incremental supplier. This is really no different than what has happened in LPG over the last 10-years where the U.S. has moved from being an importer to supplying over 75% of the world\u2019s demand growth.",
         "In short, to meet the world\u2019s growing demand for primary petrochemical products, Enterprise built the world\u2019s first open access hub for polymer grade propylene. Now we have developed the first hub for ethylene. These hubs are transforming how ethylene and propylene markets transact and will create a true marketplace for the world\u2019s primary petrochemical producers, consumers, and traders.",
         "These hubs provide the essentials for an efficient market, reliable supplies, price transparency, and access to domestic and global markets. In June, we loaded a record size ethylene cargo of 44 million pounds.",
         "Then in July, we successfully loaded combination cargoes of NGLs and olefins on the same vessel, including the simultaneous loading of propane and polymer grade propylene into separate compartments on a VLGC at our Houston Ship Channel facility, as well as the simultaneous loading of ethane and ethylene on a vessel at our Morgan\u2019s Port facility.",
         "Both vessels where the first export cargoes of their kind from the U.S. Co-loading olefins on larger vessels with NGLs allows for more efficient use of dock capacity, but it also provides significant freight benefits to petrochemical export customers.",
         "I thought I would also spend a minute to talk about what we are doing to keep our business running, while keeping our people safe. We started out the quarter with much of our headquarters staff working from home, but over the last few weeks, we have been gradually bringing our headquarters personnel back into the office and are essentially staffed at this point, fully staffed.",
         "In addition to helping our employees understand social distancing, we also now require face coverings at all times in our office. It is an adjustment, but we have adjusted and thanks to our people taking personal responsibility, both in and out of the office, our case count has been minimal.",
         "I sincerely want to thank our people for their flexibility, their adjustments and their sacrifices. And I would also like to give a shout out to our operations and commercial folks that were not able to work-from-home. Plants and pipelines don\u2019t run themselves. There is no such thing as a home based control center, and the collaboration between our commercial people that we asked to be here, ask might be too soft - that we told to be here went a long way to achieving those results.",
         "I guess, finally, I would just like to say that, I think we have got the best employees in the business, and I think their performance this quarter reflects that. And I just want them to know how much they are appreciate it. Randy."

      "Operator": [
         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Second Quarter Enterprise Products Partner Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].",
         "I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Randy Burkhalter. Please go ahead."
      ],
      "Randall Fowler": [
         "Thanks, Jim. Good morning. I will start with the income statement for the second quarter. Net income attributable to limited partners for the second quarter of 2020 was $1 billion or $0.47 per unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $0.55 per unit for the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Net income for the second quarter of 2020 included $51 million or $0.02 per unit of expense related to an increase in the deferred tax liability associated with the OTA Holdings Corporation we acquired from Marquard & Bahls in March, 2020 and the settlement of a liquidity option agreement related to our acquisition of Oiltanking back in 2014.",
         "Moving on to cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2020, compared to $2 billion for the second quarter of 2019. Changes in operating accounts or think of it as working capital, accounted for approximately $660 million or 80% of the $842 million decrease in cash flow from operations between the two periods. We used working capital to fund our marketing and contango activities, during the quarter. We currently expect this usage to peak during the third quarter of 2020.",
         "Excluding changes in working capital accounts, cash flow from operations for the second quarter of 2020 was about 10% lower than the second quarter of last year. The change in distributable cash flow between the two periods, mirrors this with a decrease of approximately 8.4%.",
         "Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations, less cash used in investing activities, plus contributions from our joint venture partners was $305 million for the quarter, which again was reduced by our use of working capital. Free cash flow was $2.7 billion for the 12-months ended June, 2020, which was 27% higher than the comparable trailing 12-months ending in June of last year.",
         "We define payout ratio as the sum of cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from operations. Our payout ratio was 83% for the second quarter of 2020, which is an inflated percentage due to our use of cash flow from operations used for working capital purposes. For the trailing 12-months, it was 62%.",
         "We declared our distribution of $0.445 per unit with respect to the second quarter on July 7th and it will be paid August 12th. This distribution represents a 1.1% increase, when compared with the same quarter of 2019 and is flat to the prior two quarters. As we stated our first quarter call, given the uncertainty of the macroeconomic backdrop, our Board will continue to evaluate our distribution growth quarter-by-quarter in 2020.",
         "Additionally, EPDs distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 1.9 million EPD units in the open market during the second quarter, which rivals the purchase activity of our typical institutional investors.",
         "Moving on to capital expenditures. We have recently placed approximately $150 million of assets into service in the second quarter and have another $6.6 billion of projects under construction and underwritten long-term contracts.",
         "Our capital investments were $910 million during the second quarter, which include $74 million for sustaining capital expenditures. We still anticipate spending between $2.5 billion and $3 billion in growth capital projects for this year and approximately $300 million for sustaining capital expenditures.",
         "For 2021 and 2022, we currently anticipate growth capital investments to be approximately $2.3 billion and $1 billion respectively. This is an aggregate $700 million reduction from guidance we provided for 2021 and 2022, at the end of the first quarter. The changes were largely attributable to the indefinite deferral of several expansion projects of which some of the largest were at our Houston Ship Channel facility.",
         "We continue to engage with industry participants regarding potential joint ventures for sanctioned projects, but the pace of these discussions have slowed due to COVID-19. Our capital expenditure forecast excludes our proposed SPOT offshore crude oil terminal that is subject to government approvals. Currently, we do not expect to receive these approvals in 2020.",
         "Moving on to capitalization, our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $30 billion at June 30, 2020. Assuming the first call date for our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio was almost 16-years. Assuming the final maturity date for the hybrids, the average life was almost 20-years. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.5%.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12-months ended June 30, 2020 was $8 billion and our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.4x after adjusting debt for the partial equity credit for the hybrid debt securities and also further reduced by unrestricted cash. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $7.3 billion at June 30 including availability under our existing credit facility and approximately 1.3 billion of unrestricted cash on hand.",
         "Finally, before we open it up for Q&A, I want to mention that we also announced this morning in a separate press release that our 2019-2020 sustainability report, which reflects our latest environmental, social and governance disclosures is currently available on our website.",
         "We have also initiated the annual review process with the independent sustainability writing providers and believe our disclosures and initiatives, which are described in this comprehensive 104 page report will be reflected in updated scores. We believe our stakeholders will find these efforts beneficial.",
         "We thank our customers, community leaders, banks, debt and equity investors, and board members for their participation in our sustainability survey that drove the outline for this report.",
         "With that Randy, I think we can open it up for questions."

Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise\u2019s General Partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance and will assist on the call today.",
         "During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, based on the beliefs of the Company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise\u2019s management team.",
         "Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements that may be made during this call.",

            "Yes. So, obviously we had this shut in because of the price crash and chaos, and we think about a million and a half, and I will just use crude as an example of 1.5 to 1.8 million barrels came off the market. I\u2019m kind of a numbers kind of person, not real visual, but if you look at how that production has come back, it is probably one of the steepest V\u2019s I\u2019ve ever seen in statistics.",
            "So yes, we have recovered a substantial amount of it. We think that maybe 300,000 barrels will lag. And but with that said, you can\u2019t deny given the amount of declines that the shales have that momentum has changed and there is a fair amount of ground to be picked up. So, that is the reality.",
            "When we look at Y-grade coming into our system. For example, those numbers are really strong and I will let Brent address that. But when we get out to 2025 as we see it today, we will be down from where we were before, and it is not because momentum doesn\u2019t pick back up.",
            "Look, we think that we were at about 1,150 completions a month in February, and we think that as we get into 2022, that we will be at around 950. Okay. And probably completing the best of the best wells that is what is in our forecast for today. And so, when you get out to 2025, there\u2019ll be some smaller volumes than what we said before.",

But, if you look at our Y-grade receipts for June, if you look at our Y-grade receipts for July, those are both records for Enterprise.",
            "And if you look at a Y-grade inventories they are at all time highs. So, in terms of how we have contracted and in terms of what we are seeing coming out of the Permian, the fractionation volumes that we have access to, those have bounced back quite nicely."

            "On the demand side, gasoline is not really - I mean, it is off 10% to 15%, depending on what numbers you look at. Diesel is the same. And again, that is to be expected. So, if we think about going forward, what the data shows is Latin America and we are a large exporting country to Latin America, is waking back up. Moving away from being shut down and largely I think about Mexico and Brazil. So, that is a positive and we are hoping that as we work off inventories, we will put our refineries back to work."

If you look at our LPG export facility, it is in a very, very good position in terms of the contracts we have in place.",

Then ultimately if supply starts going down, you look at what we have built in Mont Belvieu and the pricing points that we have. You know, I fundamentally believe that the downstream assets that we have at those pricing points benefit. So there are some offsets in this environment."

It is not that you are not in discussions with the others, but it is like Randy said in this environment, everybody\u2019s just kind of pulling their horns in.

So to be honest, this year, we\u2019ve really not spent any time coming in and looking at an MLP versus C-corp analysis. We have been too focused on executing, and just given where the uncertainty in the environment and the volatility in the environment, frankly, we are pretty content with our current MLP structure.",

Since 2008, the Trust Fund has been running deficits and no one in Congress, be it a Republican or Democrat administration has been willing to go up and raise the tax on motor gasoline and diesel because they didn\u2019t want the impact on individuals and they did not want impact on businesses.",

Maybe to start off, Jim in your prepared remarks, you sort of talked about how the marketing and spread businesses is effectively a natural hedge for the business, opportunities pop up with dislocations and so forth. I was just wondering if you can sort of give us your thoughts on how the trends play out for the balance of this year?",

Is the trend of the base business recovering stronger than the, I guess, subsiding of the marketing opportunities? Is there a scenario where Q3 can be higher than Q2 without getting like specific guidance? Just sort of talking about the trends, which is the stronger trend right now, or is the natural hedge going to reverse itself and sort of keep us in a running flat scenario?"

So when crude prices fall invariably, we will see contango \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s been the way it has been. If those spreads are there then in my mind, our pipelines are probably a lot more throughput than we have today. So that is kind of way I see it.",

When I think about EPD\u2019s unit price, do you see similar dislocations in your stock price right now? For example, you are down today with the results that you have put out. And do you see an opportunity to use the excess cash generated from the strong marketing proceeds, lower CapEx budget to potentially accelerate or increase your buyback target to take advantage of these dislocations within your stock price?"

            "Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just two quick ones for me, so just to stay on the LPG export topic, it seems like your volumes are holding up here at least in the beginning of the first half of - the second half of 2020. Can you just give your, kind of, talk about what you are seeing? Are you seeing any drop off as some of these countries come out of lockdown or are you still seeing strength there in LPG export volumes? And if so, what do you think is driving it?"

I think just in terms of how we contracted Michael, I say this humbly, but I think we will probably be toward the end to see any kind of drop off. I mean, we have just in terms of our supply position, in terms of the pricing point in terms of how aggressive that we have contracted out for this year and the next couple of years. We are in a good position to kind of maintain these type of levels. I think you are seeing us export, call it around 18 million barrels a month of LPGs. And I would say that\u2019s sticky. Those are sticky numbers."

Do you have kind of like a long-term target for where you want that to sort of settle out overtime? Or are you thinking about it that way?"

            "I mean, we do come in and compare how we are doing compared to the market and I think when we are coming in and look at the market and across the various sectors of the S&P 500 on the page, I think we are amongst the top two, top three of the sector. And it is by nature being an MLP, the whole thing with an MLP is you have a high payout ratio and so I think we comp pretty well against the market."
