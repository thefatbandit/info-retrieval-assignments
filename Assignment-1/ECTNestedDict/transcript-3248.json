         "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to First American\u2019s earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2020. Joining us today will be our Chief Executive Officer, Dennis Gilmore; and Mark Seaton, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.",

      "Dennis Gilmore": [
         "Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Today, I\u2019ll provide an update on First American\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, review the current market environment, and highlight our progress in our data and digital initiatives. Mark will give a rundown on our second quarter earnings, review the Company\u2019s capital and liquidity position, and provide an update on last year\u2019s information security incident.",
         "In response to the pandemic, our priority has been twofold, to keep our employees safe, while meeting all the service needs of our customers. Early on, we activated our business continuity plan, which enabled most of our people to work from home. Currently, approximately 80% of our workforce is working remotely. It is likely it will remain in this posture until the end of the year.",
         "During our last earnings call, we discussed the no layoff [ph] commitment we made to our employees at the end of June. At a time of great uncertainty, we viewed it as an investment in employees and one consistent with our philosophy that emphasizes in a long view.",
         "It turned out to be a good decision. Our most recent surveys revealed record levels of employee engagement. As importantly, when order volumes rebounded, more quickly than expected, we had our trained workforce in place to fulfill the needs of our customers.",
         "Our April forecast projected a 45% year-over-year decline in open purchase orders in the second quarter. Our actual experience has been materially better with just a 15% year-over-year decline. Our residential purchase business has experienced a broad consistent recovery since the trough in April when orders fell 38%.",
         "The recovery started in May when orders were down just 10%, then we saw a 5% growth in June, and so far in July, our orders were up 6%. Buyers who postponed purchases in the spring have returned during the summer, as the traditional seasonality curve has shifted.",
         "On the refinance side, open orders continue to be elevated. In the second quarter, we averaged 2,900 orders per day, in line with our April forecast. So far in July, we are opening 3,100 orders per day. We continue to believe that the refinance market will remain elevated for the remainder of the year.",
         "In our commercial business, revenues in the second quarter declined 39% from the prior year, better than our April forecast of a 50% decline. In response to the economic uncertainty, we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in activity across all commercial asset classes in the second quarter, and this is our expectation that the segment will remain under pressure for the rest of the year.",
         "However, we have seen an improvement in open orders in the recent weeks, with July commercial orders down just 10% versus last year. Other areas of our Title segment have benefited from an increase in overall transaction activity. Revenues in our database solutions business were up 12% this quarter and Docutech continues to exceed our expectations.",
         "Turning to our Specialty Insurance segment, two factors have driven elevated claims in our property and casualty business. First, we strengthened reserves for prior period claims by $5 million. Second, we incurred a higher number of large claim losses this past quarter, which we believe may be in due in part to the pandemic.",
         "Our home warranty business continues to perform well. Although, we have seen an increase in claim frequency this quarter, particularly in the appliance trade, which we attribute to the pandemic, our direct-to-consumer sales have been strong, leaving our initial outlook for 2020 unchanged.",
         "We continue to make progress on our plan to digitally transform our business and we believe the pandemic has accelerated the demand for digital closing services. We have three main areas of focus, data leadership, title automation, and digital closings.",
         "This quarter, we closed 29% more orders than in 2019, while our US headcount remained flat. This was partially attributed to the work we\u2019ve already done to automate and optimize the workflow of our title production process.",
         "Because title automation is data dependent, we continue to invest heavily in our data assets. Through our patented automated data extraction process, we can accurately capture title and property information more efficiently than ever, enabling us to collect a more comprehensive set of data for the same costs. We believe we have broader coverage and deeper more comprehensive title and property databases than any other company.",
         "Lastly, we continue to work on a number of initiatives to digitize our core closing capabilities. One notable effort we have underway is Endpoint, a digital title and escrow company we launched in 2018. In just 18 months, Endpoint has a 2% market share in Seattle. We\u2019ve launched in Southern California this quarter and currently entering the Phoenix market. Also, although, it\u2019s still early days, Endpoint has seen rapid initial success in offering buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals a digital mobile-first user experience.",
         "The investments First American has been making over the past few years to secure its data leadership, accelerate title automation and enable digital closing has put us in a superior position to add value for our customers as the digital innovation transforms the mortgage and home-buying experience.",
         "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mark."
      ],
      "Mark Seaton": [
         "Thank you, Dennis. In the second quarter, we earned $1.52 per diluted share. Excluding net realized investment gains of $69 million, primarily related to an increase in the value of equity securities, we earned $1.05 per diluted share.",
         "In the Title Insurance and Services segment, direct premium and escrow fees were down 4% compared with last year. This decrease reflects a 26% decline in the average revenue per order, largely offset by a 29% increase in the number of closed orders.",
         "The average revenue per order decreased to $1,950 due to a shift in the mix of direct title of orders to lower-premium refinance transactions. The average revenue per order for commercial transactions declined 21%, while refinance increased 6% and purchase increased 1%. Agent premiums, which are recorded on approximately a one quarter lag relative to direct premiums were up 10%. The agent split was 79.0% of agent premiums.",
         "Information and other revenues totaled $228 million, up 15% compared with last year. The increase was primarily due to the recent acquisition of Docutech and the growth in mortgage originations that led to higher demand for the company\u2019s title information products.",
         "Investment income within the Title Insurance and Services segment was $43 million, down 39%, primarily due to the impact of the decline in short term interest rates on the investment portfolio and cash balances.",
         "Personnel costs were $417 million, down 1% from the prior year. This decline was primarily attributable to lower incentive compensation expense that was largely offset by higher costs as a result of recent acquisitions.",
         "Other operating expenses were $222 million, up 14% from last year. The increase was primarily due to higher production-related costs as a result of the growth in order volume, the impact of recent acquisitions and higher cost in a number of expense categories, partly offset by lower travel expense.",
         "The provision for title policy losses and other claims was $56 million or 5.0% of title premiums and escrow fees, an increase from a 4.0% loss provision rate in the prior year.",
         "Claims experience continues to be favorable relative to our expectations. Incurred title claims totaled $29 million in the second quarter, a 26% decline relative to 2019. To-date, we have not seen an uptick in claims. Our intent is to maintain a 5% loss rate until we have more visibility into how the current environment will affect our claims experience.",
         "Depreciation and amortization expense was $39 million in the second quarter, up $8 million or 26% compared with the same period last year, primarily due to recent acquisitions.",
         "Pretax income for the Title Insurance and Services segment was $238 million in the second quarter compared with $233 million in the prior year. Pretax margin was 16.3% compared with 17.0% last year, excluding the impact of net realized investment gains, pretax margin was 12.5% this quarter compared with 16.5% last year.",
         "Net expenses in the corporate segment were $20 million, up $1 million compared with last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8%, in line with our normalized tax rate.",
         "Notes and contracts payable on our balance sheet totaled just over $1 billion as of June 30th, which consists of $992 million of senior notes, $14 million of trust deed notes and $5 million of other notes and obligations. In May, we issued $450 million of 4.0% 10 year senior notes due 2030.",
         "We used $280 million of the proceeds to pay down our credit facility and the remainder is currently held at our holding company. Today, we have the entire amount available under our $700 million revolving credit facility. It has now been a little over a year since the information security incident and we wanted to take the opportunity to provide you with an update.",
         "In March, the Nebraska Department of Insurance, the primary regulator of our Title Insurance Company, led an examination of our information security program as of June 30, 2019, and our response to the information security incident.",
         "The resulting report concluded that our IT general control environment is suitably designed and is operating effectively and that we adequately and appropriately detected, analyzed, contained, eradicated and recovered from the security incident and that we are in compliance with New York\u2019s cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies.",
         "A number of other regulators have closed investigation without any findings. Only two investigations have been active recently, one being conducted by the enforcement division of the New York Department of Financial Services and the other by the SEC enforcement staff.",
         "The New York Department of Financial Services, notwithstanding the compliance finding in the examination report, I mentioned earlier, has alleged violations of New York\u2019s cybersecurity requirements. Our efforts to resolve the matter had not been successful, and as a result, yesterday they filed a statement of charges.",
         "We intend to conduct a vigorous defense, which will focus on, among other matters, the examination report and at the conclusion regarding our compliance with New York\u2019s cybersecurity requirements.",
         "The SEC enforcement staff is questioning the adequacy of disclosures we made at the time of the incident and the adequacy of our disclosure controls. There are also four class actions pending, which consistent with our typical approach to litigation, we\u2019re aggressively defending against. We do not believe that these investigations and class actions will be material from a financial perspective.",
         "I would now like to turn the call back over to the operator to take your questions."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. Thanks. Wanted to drill down on expectations for the residential purchase and commercial market. Dennis, how much of the balance and on the purchase side, do you think is due to pent-up demand versus just maybe higher demand as a result of improved affordability and other reasons?",
            "And also, I know it\u2019s a hard question, but on the commercial side, what are your expectations for the trajectory of that as we go into the back half of the year? It sounds like it\u2019s made a pretty significant improvement so far in July."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Mark DeVries"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Let\u2019s start with the purchase business. It\u2019s interesting, specifically to your question, pent-up demand or a shift in the curve, it\u2019s hard to tell right now, but the market is very strong. We forecasted a 45% decline in the second quarter, and clearly it turned out better than that. And when we sit here now, increased in May, increased in June, increased in July. Really what it looks like to us is the just the cyclical, I mean, the curve shifted out the spring buying season shifted into the summer. So very strong, very fast recovery.",
            "On the commercial side, probably the one market we still see headwinds, and we will probably see it for the rest of the year, so let\u2019s kind of break it down. We thought we would be down 50% on commercial in the second quarter. We\u2019re actually down nearly 39%.",
            "Now, we\u2019re also seeing an uptick in deals right now, which is interesting early in July. They are only down 10% from a year ago. But I guess, you\u2019re cautioned, our ARPU will be down. We\u2019re not seeing it turning out of the mega deals.",
            "So kind of how I see commercial right now. It will definitely be down for the rest of the year. It will - we\u2019ll face headwinds there. But even with all that, the business has continued to perform very well and material contributor to our profitability, that\u2019s kind of how we see commercial right now."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. So it sounds like maybe a little bit more of a revenue headwind than a transaction headwind. It\u2019s the mega deals are still kind of slow to come back?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. At this stage, I think that it will just take a little longer for the commercial market kind of to rebalance. I have no reason to believe the mega deals won\u2019t come back, but I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re going to come back later in the year."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hi, good morning. Another impossible question to answer. But when you look at the refi volumes and your comment that refi is going to remain strong through the balance of the year, we had tight capacity earlier in the second quarter, and so some of that I\u2019m wondering is getting pushed out.",
            "But now that were sub-3%, I mean - have you looked or do you have a sense of sort of what the addressable loan market is today that would benefit from a refi? I\u2019m guessing a lot of loans even in the high-3s now are attractive for refi. But have you ever been able to size that opportunity from here. I know you\u2019ve got the lag on agent as well, but just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that?"

         "Speaker": "Jack Micenko"
      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. I\u2019m going to come at that question a little differently. It kind of is an impossible question, but just kind of what are we seeing right now. We forecasted 3,000 orders a day in the second quarter. We came in at 2,900. So very close to our forecast. So far in July, we\u2019re running at 3,100, so a little better than our forecast. But when we look out for the rest of the year, I think refinance will stay strong all through the year going into \u201821 kind of to your question.",
            "Now the second part of your question is, it makes sense to us as originators have built capacity and as we go into the seasonally slower period of the purchase, I think the spreads will improve on the refinance and I think we\u2019ll actually see again strong demand for refinance in the fourth quarter and first quarter. We can\u2019t really size the market, but we think it\u2019s going to be a strong market for us for the foreseeable future."

      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. And then on Docutech, can you talk about the contribution this quarter, I think tech was up 15%, 16% year-over-year and kind of what the expectation is for that business for the year?"

      },
      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. So, Docutech in the second quarter, I mean, we talked about how well it\u2019s been performing. It was $20 million in revenue and that\u2019s all included the information and other line item and the EBITDA was a little over $9 million and obviously are performing well given the strength in the refi market. So I think that\u2019s a good run rate at least, while we see elevated refis.",
            "I think going forward as we integrated more into First American, we\u2019re not going to continue to provide numbers just because it will be integrated into our operations, but in the second quarter, it was still fairly standalone in $20 million of revenue, $9 million of EBITDA."

         "Remarks": [

I mean we\u2019re paying more notary fees now than we were prior to the - to COVID happening. We\u2019re spending more on laptops and certain types of equipment that has hit that line item recently. So, I think there\u2019s a few different things happening there, not just Docutech."

It was a smart thing to do, the right thing to do and it really proved beneficial to us as the markets recovered much faster than maybe we anticipated at the end of the first quarter.",
            "Why it\u2019s the right thing to do is we\u2019ve seen a big uptick in our employee engagement scores as you would expect and they\u2019ve been very focused in serving our customers. Now kind of going forward, we\u2019re going to revert back to our normal management to our success ratio is how we\u2019re looking at the business right now."

In terms of our revenue, about 31% of our revenue in the second quarter was commercial - of our commercial revenue 31% was refi and that\u2019s been gradually increasing over the last couple of years. A year ago it was 28%. So we are seeing somewhat of a mitigating factor with refi and commercial business."

            "What happened in the second quarter was we really saw California where we get a lot of our direct business really fell really sharply from a volumes perspective and so it really was a mix issue, right. So, because California was just depressed from a volume perspective, we saw the ARPU for the - for our purchase revenue kind of be up 1% like you\u2019ve talked about.",
            "But going forward and we\u2019ve seen California really come back, so I don\u2019t think that over the next - over Q3 and Q4 that we should see that improve because we\u2019ve seen California snap back so aggressively."

            "I just want to touch on the info and services line a bit. Dennis, you guys have made a pretty conservative effort over the years. You\u2019ve done a really good job of cutting some of the cords or I guess the dependency to CoreLogic for data. I guess, improving the expense related to that data is one thing, driving revenues is another thing. But just curious about your longer term views around building out more of a robust kind of data offering.",
            "And then on that 10-year agreement with CoreLogic that expired in June, does that free you guys up in any way as far as where or maybe to what extent you guys can compete with CoreLogic?"

         "Remarks": [
            "We have no limitation at all how we can compete with CoreLogic start there. We\u2019ve been building out our databases now for a number of years and we\u2019ve talked about it over the last few years. Right now, we think without any doubt we have the most complete, most comprehensive datasets out there in the industry bigger than anybody else right now and more depth than anybody else.",
            "And why is that\u2019s on-board, John, is because we\u2019re using it for our insurance purposes, running our automation on our title. And then you couple that with, maybe we haven\u2019t talked a lot about this, as we developed a very sophisticated patent pending, an extra patented data extraction method where we can take vast amounts of information in a very automated manner to get it into our databases.",
            "So what I\u2019ll tell you is our databases continue to grow in depth and content. We\u2019ll use that to drive greater and greater title automation in the future. And then maybe where you\u2019re heading, secondarily, we\u2019re seeing nice growth in our other just, so called, other data businesses, our licensing business, our online business, others."

I mean, I know some people think of it as one business, I know you don\u2019t, John, but we really have our international business in there, we\u2019ve got our default business, we\u2019ve got Docutech, we have our data businesses that Dennis talked about. I think it\u2019s safe to say that the margin profile is higher than our overall title segment.",
            "But we don\u2019t - since it\u2019s really kind of a sliver of many different businesses, we don\u2019t have a kind of a roll-up of what the margin profile is. But since they are generally speaking more data and more software-driven, the margin profile is higher than overall title."

            "Okay, that\u2019s what I was looking for. That\u2019s very helpful. And then last one from me. On the loss provision rate, it seems like you guys are being really, really conservative there. I mean claims are down year-over-year, you\u2019re not seeing really any adverse developments.",
            "But just curious how long do you carry that 5% rate? I mean, is there a target level just absolute dollars you\u2019re looking to achieve or is that, you hold that 5% until you get a little more clarity on market trends and I guess how forbearance plays out from here?"

      "39": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. I\u2019ll start on that one. So again, we feel really good about our reserves. We felt great about them heading into this crisis. And in the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been booking at a 4% loss rate and one of the factors that goes into claims is economic environment. That\u2019s one of the factors and we\u2019re in a tougher economic environment this year than we were last year.",
            "So we thought we would do the prudent thing and raise the loss rate to 5%. Now, we haven\u2019t seen any uptick in claims like we\u2019ve talked about. And in fact, every single month of the year so far our claims have been below our - actually our own forecast, we just that sign that you\u2019re at least appropriately reserved.",
            "So right now, the plan is that there\u2019s still uncertainty in the market. We will plan continuing to book the 5% for a couple of quarters here. And we see - we think it\u2019s a little bit too early to know what the ultimate impact of COVID is on our claims and once we get a little bit more visibility we\u2019ll look at it."

      "40": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And John, I would only add is, the real telling time will become probably early \u201821 when we see the forbearance issues kind of unwinding. We\u2019ll see what the default rates are. And we do know that when we see an increase in default, it has a possibility for increased claims for us. So this will probably become a lot clear in early \u201821 is my guess."

      "41": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And help school me a bit on the process with the point estimate in reserves. Is there a point where you get over reserve to some extent where you have to release?"

         "Speaker": "John Campbell"
      },
      "42": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. The general rule of thumb is that we can\u2019t be more than 10% above our auditors and we can\u2019t be more than 5% below. I mean I think that\u2019s the general rule of thumb. As of June 30th, we were 4.1% above our third-party actuary.",
            "So we do have room there. But you\u2019re right, I mean we can\u2019t increase our reserves endlessly. There is a cap, but we still have a some cushion before we get to that point."

            "And heading to Q3 and Q4, it\u2019s going to fall a little bit just because of reinvestment at lower rates, but we still feel like it will be between $40 million and $43 million, probably a little lower in that range. So that\u2019s our expectation for investment income.",
            "Certainly, if commercial volume picks up, we\u2019ll be better in 10/31, there\u2019s no question about that, but I still think it will still be between the $40 million to $43 million range. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that much of a swing."

I think what\u2019s happening right now with home warranty is, yes, we\u2019re having more claims, especially appliances, because more people are at home, they are using their equipment more, but we\u2019re also doing a lot better than we were expecting on direct-to-consumer.",
            "And really, when we looked at our forecast for the year, it\u2019s kind of right in line with what we thought at the beginning of the year. So there is room to raise rates. Although, that\u2019s not like a key part of our strategy now, just because it\u2019s something we regularly do. We\u2019ve been doing that for several years now."
