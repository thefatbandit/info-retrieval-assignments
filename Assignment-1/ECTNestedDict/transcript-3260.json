         "Thanks, Nelson, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I, too, want to extend my appreciation to our hard-working team that has continued to perform during these challenging times. Columbia had another strong quarter, generating normalized FFO of $0.40, our highest level since 2018, despite the COVID-19 pandemic and recent dispositions. We produced same-store NOI based on cash rents of $57 million, up a robust 20% over the same period last year, which is some of the strongest growth in the industry.",
         "During the quarter, our team leased another 87,000 square feet, as Nelson mentioned, which is more space than we leased in the same quarter last year despite COVID-19 and our continued high occupancy and low rollover. We ended June with a lease percentage of 97.2%. We also produced another quarter of strong leasing spreads with an increase of 12% on a cash basis and as Nelson mentioned, an increase of 28% on a GAAP basis, our 10th consecutive quarter in double digits.",
         "With our focus on liquidity and maintaining a strong balance sheet during these uncertain times, we did not repurchase any common shares during the quarter, even though we view our stock as a compelling value. We have $143 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization. Colombia\u2019s balance sheet remains a source of strength for us, not only during challenging times such as these but also for capitalizing on future opportunities.",
         "As the pandemic began to spread in March, you\u2019ll recall, we drew $200 million on our credit line as we were selling our final two noncore assets for combined gross proceeds of nearly $260 million. We also have lower CapEx needs due to the current slower pace of leasing activity. We ended June with over $300 million of cash, including our cash in joint ventures, plus nearly $150 million still available under our credit line.",
         "Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio improved slightly during the quarter to 7.3 times. And our net debt to gross real estate assets fell virtually constant at 35.2%. And our fixed charge coverage ratio improved from 3.4 times to 3.7 times during the quarter. We have more than $4 billion of unencumbered properties, and our only debt maturities before 2022 continue to be the modest loans at our share on Terminal Warehouse and 799 Broadway.",
         "As Nelson mentioned, our tenant roster is one of the best, and we\u2019ve collected over 97% of total rents for the second quarter. Looking ahead, we have long lease durations, limited exposure to street retail and transient parking and limited rollover of just 1.8% before the end of this year with an additional 8.3% next year.",
         "Before turning to our updated guidance, I want to touch on one recent development. As we announced earlier this month, we terminated WeWork\u2019s lease at 149 Madison in New York, cutting our overall WeWork exposure roughly in half. We received $6.4 million for the termination of the lease. We now have the benefit of the base building work that WeWork performed, and we\u2019ve been relieved of the obligation to pay $18.7 million for additional work, much of which would have been WeWork specific build-out. We now have complete control and flexibility over what improvements to make and when to make them. Of course, we will need to finish the renovation of this building and lease it to others, but that was our original plan when we bought this building.",
         "Turning to guidance. I want to mention a couple of onetime items that are in our numbers. First, our second quarter results include a lease termination payment at 315 Park Avenue South. We discussed it on our last call, but as a reminder, we replaced our tenant on the top two floors with a growing Amazon subsidiary under better terms. And second, as we also disclosed recently, our termination of the WeWork lease at 149 Madison early in the third quarter, resulted in a termination payment equal to 10 months\u2019 rent instead of the six months of WeWork rent we had expected this year.",
         "Taking into account those onetime items as well as our ongoing performance, we are raising our normalized FFO outlook from a range of $1.40 to $1.48 to a new range of $1.46 to $1.51, an increase of $0.06 at the low end and $0.03 at the high end. While economic conditions remain fluid, we feel very confident in this new higher range, given the strength of our tenant roster and the continued strong execution by our team.",
         "I will close by echoing Nelson\u2019s comments that we understand COVID presents serious challenges for our industry and none of us knows exactly what the long-term impacts will be. We also don\u2019t know what the months ahead may hold any more than anyone else does. But despite all of that, we\u2019re navigating the challenges of this unusual year well so far. And what Columbia has accomplished over the years, a best-in-class portfolio, a superb tenant roster, a skilled and dedicated team and a solid balance sheet, mean that we\u2019re operating from a position of strength and are well positioned to meet these new challenges. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the rest of the year.",
         "And right now, operator, if you could, please open the lines for questions."
      ],
      "Matt Stover": [
         "Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to the second quarter 2020 Columbia Property Trust Investor conference call. On the call with me today are Nelson Mills, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Fleming, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our senior management team.",
         "We released our results this afternoon in our quarterly supplemental package, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website and on file with the SEC on Form 8-K. We also filed 10-Q with the SEC this afternoon, and an audio replay of this call will be available by this time tomorrow.",
         "Statements made on today\u2019s conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which includes specific risks pertaining to COVID-19. Forward-looking statements are made based on our current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to us at this time. Columbia undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on this conference call. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our supplemental data.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Nelson Mills."
      ],
      "Nelson Mills": [
         "Thank you, Matt, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Due to the hard work and dedication of our talented team, we again generated solid performance in the second quarter as we successfully navigated this challenging market environment. Our second quarter performance demonstrates not only the strength of our unique portfolio, but our ability to remain focused even while prioritizing the health and well-being of our employees and those we serve.",
         "Building on our performance over the past year, we produced strong second quarter results. We achieved normalized FFO of $0.40 per share and drove robust same-store NOI growth of 20% on a cash basis. Despite the COVID shutdown and even with limited vacancy and near-term rollover, our team leased another 87,000 square feet, which is more than the second quarter of last year. We ended June with a leased rate of 97.2%. We also produced strong leasing spreads of 12% on a cash basis and 28% on a GAAP basis. That 28% represents our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit leasing spreads.",
         "While we have limited available space across the portfolio, a leasing accomplishment worthy of note with our extension and expansion with Berkeley Research Group at 1800 M Street in Washington, DC\u2019s Golden Triangle. We extended this global consulting firm\u2019s 57,000 square foot lease by an additional five years until 2030, and we also expanded their space by an additional 11,000 square feet. This gives Berkeley a total of 68,000 square feet at this fully modernized Class A property.",
         "Rounding out our second quarter operating performance, we collected 97.2% of all rents for the second quarter, including nearly 99% of office rents. These amounts increase by another 0.6% if we take deferred rent into account. In a moment, Jim will provide further detail on our rent collections as well as our updated full year guidance, which we are pleased to raise significantly due to our continuing strong execution.",
         "Now turning to our current market environment. The pandemic\u2019s effects on economic conditions, including real estate occupancy and operations remain fluid. However, we remain optimistic for an eventual restoration and recovery. Of course, we are likely many months away from returning to anything resembling our pre-COVID environment. And there could certainly be longer-term effects on the degree and form of office tenant demand. But we are well positioned to weather these conditions, to maintain financial stability and to emerge with opportunities for future growth.",
         "I\u2019d like to provide five reasons why the Columbia Property Trust team remains confident in our ability to create shareholder value. The first is the quality and position of our portfolio. Our well-leased unique properties set us apart. We\u2019re concentrated in submarkets that attract some of the most dynamic tenants, particularly in tech and media. Located within the most vital gateway markets, we are confident that these neighborhoods will retain their strong appeal beyond this crisis.",
         "We\u2019ve curated a portfolio of attractive, modernized properties with efficient floor plates and desirable amenities. Our portfolio has limited exposure to street-level retail and transient parking and features low- and mid-rise buildings that allow for less crowded elevators and greater social distancing. And our modern office layouts feature flexible open floor plans to accommodate adjustments to density and configuration as required by our tenants.",
         "The second reason is our roster of tenants. Our buildings have attracted some of the most innovative and financially resilient companies in the world, and we\u2019re proud to partner with them. Many of these dynamic growth companies understand that innovation is driven by collaboration around which they\u2019ve built their businesses and culture. While working from home has provided a necessary near-term solution, it\u2019s becoming a hindrance to maintaining productivity and promoting creativity.",
         "Recent articles, including one in the Wall Street Journal last week, point out that companies are finding that projects take longer, collaboration is less likely and the recruiting and training of new employees can be a struggle in a virtual environment. Some companies, Google for example, plan to extend work from home status well into next year. While a relatively low percentage of our tenants occupy their spaces today, the vast majority have indicated plans to phase back into the office beginning late summer to early fall. And of course, we are open and prepared for their safe and comfortable return.",
         "The third reason we remain confident in our ability to create value for shareholders is our team and platform. Our growth in recent years is the direct result of the talented men and women of Columbia Property Trust. Our accretive acquisition and integration of Normandy Real Estate Management, while a relatively modest monetary investment, substantially bolster our capabilities, relationships and competitive reach. The expertise and experience the former Normandy team brings to the table has already helped us address many of the near-term challenges brought on by COVID-19. It should continue to prove invaluable as we navigate the evolving office landscape and creatively meet the needs of tenants. We not only added a complementary and profitable fund management business, but we now have the strongest set of capabilities in our company\u2019s history, including construction, development, leasing and property management, all now fully integrated into our platform.",
         "Fourth, we agree with the growing number of voices expressing confidence in the resilience and expected recovery of our country, and particularly our vital major cities, including New York and San Francisco. Of course, there will be near-term hurdles to restoration, regaining confidence in mass transit foremost among them. And there is some concern over changes in demand due to the retention of work-from-home policies or shifts to secondary or suburban markets with less density.",
         "After September 11, and at other times in our nation\u2019s history, we\u2019ve heard a similar refrain. But we expect the factors that drove many of the world\u2019s most dynamic and profitable companies as well as the talent they rely upon for their success to these great cities will remain. This is a health-crisis-driven event and solving the COVID threat is essential to a return to normalcy, but we are confident in that return in due time. Could there be significant long-lasting shifts in demand? That\u2019s quite possible, perhaps even likely. Economic downturns for one reason or another are inevitable. That\u2019s why we continue to believe that portfolio quality, location and the capabilities of our team are so important. While not immune to market declines, we believe we are as well positioned as any company in the sector to survive and thrive.",
         "And the fifth reason for our confidence is our financial strength. Columbia has maintained and, in fact, strengthened its financial position in recent years, as Jim will detail in a moment. We are over 97% leased with extended lease durations and very limited near-term expirations. This solid foundation should not only allow us to weather current conditions, but also continue to seek attractive value creation opportunities in the years ahead.",
         "Let\u2019s review some of our current opportunities. Our approach to development and redevelopment has always been highly disciplined, and that now allows us to manage our project pipeline in response to changing market conditions. 799 Broadway is one of the best examples of new boutique office space in a prime New York City location. The construction schedule was delayed by a few months, and physical tenant tours are limited. But we\u2019re back up to speed on the project and have been virtually touring prospective tenants through this exceptionally designed loft style office building.",
         "It\u2019s important to note that we\u2019ve recently enhanced the design to include even more of the health and wellness features that tenants are now putting at a premium in a post-COVID environment. We\u2019re also excited to move forward with 80 M Street in Washington, DC\u2019s Capital Riverfront District. Earlier this year, we pre-leased 60% of this highly innovative 105,000 square foot vertical expansion. Construction has continued unabated on this pioneering project, which will make 80 M Street the very first office building in our nation\u2019s capital to use environmentally friendly mass timber construction.",
         "Rounding out our development pipeline, our projects at 101 Franklin Street and Terminal Warehouse in Manhattan both remain in the design and planning stage. We have the flexibility to monitor market conditions, and work with our partners to optimize future plans for these extensive projects, both of which we continue to believe will hold strong appeal for discerning high quality tenants.",
         "Before I turn it over to Jim, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our 2019 ESG report, which highlights our focus on community, diversity, the environment and other important initiatives. I encourage you to review a copy on our website at your convenience. I\u2019m particularly proud of our team for actively embracing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Our team was spurred to action and a commitment to change by recent social unrest and the instances or racial injustice that triggered them. We established teams with broad and enthusiastic participation, to address the areas of education awareness, opportunity, responsibility and community. We have high expectations for making a real impact and becoming an even stronger and more effective team.",
         "In summary, we at Columbia Property Trust are confident in our ability to successfully navigate these uncertain times. We have a best-in-class, high-quality portfolio, a tenant roster that\u2019s second to none, a highly capable and motivated team, a strong balance sheet and a disciplined capital allocation strategy. It\u2019s this combination that makes us confident in the future.",
         "I want to again thank my talented and committed teammates for their dedication. We greatly appreciate our shareholders for their confidence in our platform and abilities. We\u2019ll continue to work each day to earn your trust, and I look forward to updating you again as we move through this unprecedented year.",
         "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim to provide further detail on our results and our updated guidance for 2020."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks for taking the question. So just maybe first one on the quarter and just the guidance. I\u2019m just wondering if you took any reserves for any bad debt related to any of the office or smaller retail centers that you do have exposure to, or any straight-line rents that you may have written off during the quarter?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Vikram Malhotra"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Hey, Vikram, this is Jim. Yes, there were a couple. There is a straight-line rent write-off when we terminated the Winton lease at the top of 315 Park Avenue South. It was a little over $2 million. That\u2019s in the numbers. But then, again, we got a termination payment of a little over $6 million that more than covered that write-off as well as the capital cost. And I think as we\u2019ve said before, the rental rate going forward is a little bit higher than it was in the past. So that was really a great outcome for us.",
            "Net \u2013 I mean, it was a good outcome in the immediate sense, and it\u2019s also good going forward. And it\u2019s an Amazon subsidiary with good credit. So all good there. That\u2019s really the only straight-line write-off that we\u2019ve dealt with. We have done some \u2013 we have written off some bad debt. It\u2019s just a little bit over $200,000, Vikram. It\u2019s a very small number. We really haven\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have a lot of retail exposure, as you know, and we really haven\u2019t had that much to deal with.",
            "We have talked about the deferrals. We\u2019ve got about $500,000 of deferrals that we do believe we will collect over time. Some of those are retail and some of those are office. But again, that\u2019s a pretty small number. I think it\u2019s 0.6% of our total. And even if we exclude those deferrals and even with the write-offs, we still collected 90 \u2013 over 97% of our rents for the quarter."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Jim Fleming"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. I\u2019m just wondering, like, obviously, today, the amounts are small, but this is likely to have \u2013 the current situation is likely to have impacts over the next 6 to 12 months, as we\u2019ve heard from many of your peers. So I\u2019m just wondering, sort of looking at the portfolio, whether it\u2019s co-working or just \u2013 I know retail is very small. But is there \u2013 do you just not see the need today to take any reserves?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Vikram Malhotra"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Well, we have taken some, and we\u2019ve renegotiated deferrals, as Jim mentioned, several hundred thousand dollars. But in those cases \u2013 even in those cases, we have guarantees and other credit enhancements in place that we feel are adequate. So we think those are very collectable.",
            "The portfolio, obviously, Vikram, we look very closely at this. We know what\u2019s going on. We see the pressure in the system and our sector. But as we as we go through the portfolio today, and this is after several months of discussion with tenants and looking pretty closely. Today, we do not feel the need to write-off more. We have a well leased portfolio, good credit tenants. As you know, a lot of tech and media concentration, which a lot of those companies are doing quite well.",
            "But we \u2013 as we said, we understand this could last much longer and could get worse. But at this time, from what we see, we don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need for anymore \u2013 given the state of the tenant roster and the portfolio, we don\u2019t see a need to write-off anymore. We think they\u2019re collectible."

We feel confident in our guidance range. Even if there is some more of that. But again, retail exposure is small, transient parking is small part of our portfolio."

      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, okay. And then just on the guidance, kind of you referenced having room in there. If you x out the termination fee, it\u2019s a net modest decrease to the prior guidance. You look at the components of the guidance, I\u2019m just trying to understand, excluding that termination, kind of can you give us a little bit more of the puts and takes?"

      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, the net termination was about \u2013 net of the straight-line rent write-off was about $4 million. So it moved us up a little bit. But I mean, I would say the midpoint still moved up a bit even relative to that, even without that. And we have, as I said, we do have confidence going forward that we\u2019ve got enough room in there to take care of what may happen in the rest of the year. So it\u2019s definitely \u2013 we\u2019re in uncertain times Vikram. We\u2019re in a very unusual environment. But we are \u2013 we have been very proactive, as Nelson mentioned, in communicating with our tenants.",
            "We\u2019re collecting a very high percentage of our rents. And we feel we \u2013 yes, there\u2019s some noise from termination fees and that sort of thing, but they are in typical years. That\u2019s not unusual. We\u2019ve seen it in prior years as well. And so I\u2019d say things have moved up a little bit in our view, gotten a little bit better in our view, still a lot of uncertainty, but a little bit better in our view as we look at the second half of the year."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. We had the good fortune of entering this year with very low, as you know, well leased and very little lull and then good credit tenants as well. So just to put the termination payments in perspective, the Winton Capital was only $0.03 to $0.04. And we also had a termination payment from WeWork equivalent to about six months \u2013 or 10 months of rent. But in our original guidance, we had \u2013 we were counting on six months of rent anyway from them. So that \u2013 the impact of the two termination payments are not huge. It\u2019s pretty much steady state is what we expected \u2013 with what we expected."

            "Okay, great. And then just last one for me. Can you remind us, what was the original sort of playbook for the Madison assets that you\u2019ve got back from WeWork? And kind of how \u2013 in your mind, just \u2013 I know it\u2019s early, and we\u2019re in COVID right now, but how would that playbook change. Like, what\u2019s the plan going forward?"

      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So when we originally bought the property, a couple of years ago, the intention was always \u2013 it\u2019s a terrific. It\u2019s on the smaller side. It\u2019s one of our smaller properties, 120,000 feet. But it\u2019s a well configured boutique building in Midtown South. It\u2019s just right in the heart of what we do. So we bought it well before WeWork came along as a possibility. The WeWork deal was compelling primarily \u2013 we got a nice rate from WeWork. We got the rate we were asking, but more importantly, they were going to build out and do a lot of work, right? And that\u2019s what made us go that direction.",
            "And they\u2019ve done \u2013 they\u2019ve done the base building work or most of it. And they spent very little of the allowance for tenant improvements, which we\u2019ve taken back, right? So we feel good about it. It was a good win-win deal for us and WeWork. They were trying to reduce their exposure. So we feel good about that deal. As far as going forward, again, nice boutique property. It could be a single-tenant user, more likely, I think, multi-tenant, well-located property. We\u2019ve got a bit more work to do on it. We\u2019ll use that reserve plus maybe a little bit more to complete the building. And obviously, we\u2019re in a slowdown right now with COVID.",
            "So there\u2019s a lot of questions about how rates and how fast and absorption. So \u2013 but yes, we\u2019re optimistic about it of being a fair property and being able to get it leased in the next year plus probably. And yes, it should \u2013 we\u2019re back to plan A essentially."

My guess is that we\u2019ll have even more savings in the second half of the year, but we really haven\u2019t budgeted that at this point. So we don\u2019t need for that to happen in order for us to get to our guidance. But it\u2019s \u2013 it probably will happen. But as we\u2019re well supplied now.

And that was as anticipated. We had early on, since the shutdown, we\u2019ve been in regular active conversation with tenants. We\u2019ve held town halls. We\u2019ve been very connected with them. Most of them have planned all along to do the reopenings late summer or after Labor Day, particularly in New York.",

Even Twitter, for example, who came out and said that they would consider work from home longer term, and even they will start to renter around that time. So we do think the buildings start to \u2013 the utilization starts to go up pretty dramatically after Labor Day.",

I do think, and we do believe that once it starts, it may cascade a little faster than some are anticipating. Just because once you\u2019re back, your teammates your back, you want to be back, your partners, your competitors. We think it could start to pick up post Labor Day. But even if it doesn\u2019t, even if it\u2019s slower, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019re ready. We\u2019re prepared for reentry. And we\u2019ll, whatever pace it is, we\u2019ll be ready for it."

And that really the more significant ones are, Nelson mentioned Amazon. It\u2019s about 90,000 square feet, well under market at University circle. We\u2019ve got a 25,000 square foot user at 650 California that\u2019s similarly way under market. We got a 20,000 at 116 Huntington in Boston and a 11,000 at 1600 Boston that are, we thought before, we\u2019re well under market. So really, we were kind of at double-digit rent roll up expectations next year. I don\u2019t know where that \u2013 how that will play out given COVID and all that.

We may just let the existing loan stay in place on Terminal Warehouse. It\u2019s an acquisition loan with some extension rights.

It\u2019s a new construction, just topped out, curtain wall is going up. It\u2019s going to deliver second quarter of next year. That\u2019s been delayed just a few months by COVID. We were in very active \u2013 not active discussion, but very \u2013 a lot of interested parties looking at the property pre-COVID.",
            "Several of those continue. And we\u2019re very optimistic about that property. Will it be exactly, would it be quite as high a rate, net effective rate as pre-COVID, maybe not, but it could be. It could be very close. And given the unique nature of that property and given the special property it is. So very excited. Hopefully, in the next quarter or two, we\u2019ll have some movement on that one, but as well as all these others."

We always have \u2013 today, based on our outlook and expectations, we think it\u2019s very well protected. But we do take a long-term view. We do look out several years and on the dividend. If things were, if the economy or our situation were to worsen in any way, we\u2019d address it. But today, Jim can add what he\u2019d like.

Great questions, as always, and we really appreciate those, and we appreciate all of you being with us today and participating on our call. I think you can see from our quarterly results and our near-term outlook for this year that it reflects a portfolio and a company that\u2019s well positioned. And obviously, as we\u2019ve said, these are challenging times, and we don\u2019t know better than anybody else what the outlook is going to be for our economy and our sector and industry. But I will say we have the good fortune of having a very well positioned portfolio, and we\u2019re going to work very hard to keep it that way and to grow from there.",
