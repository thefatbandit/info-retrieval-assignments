      "Bethany Mancini": [
         "Thank you. The health care sector continues to prove its resilience and significance to the U.S. population and economy. After 5 months of experience with COVID-19, hospitals and physicians are now better equipped with protocols in place and adequate PPE to serve COVID patients. At the same time, providers are managing higher demand from the delay of scheduled care.",
         "Second quarter employment growth numbers are showing COVID\u2019s unprecedented impact on jobs in April and May, with promising signs of recovery in the health care sector from late May into June and continued positive momentum heading into the third quarter. Notably, the pace of recovery in the ambulatory sector, including physician offices, has doubled that of the broader economy.",
         "Health care providers are meeting pent-up demand for elective care and the resurgence of strong utilization trends, returning to more normalized levels quickly. HR\u2019s tenants on average are operating near full capacity, and they are better prepared to provide ongoing outpatient care, even in the event of a local surge.",
         "Telemedicine served a critical role in April and May for many providers. The easing of its restrictions and higher reimbursement helped sustain patient care and physician practice revenues during the height of the pandemic and the shutdown of non-emergent care. Since then, physician offices in most of our markets have returned to seeing a majority of patients in person.",
         "The Trump administration issued an Executive Order earlier this week to review and continue Medicare\u2019s coverage of telehealth services. After which, CMS proposed to permanently allow Medicare providers to use telehealth for evaluation and management services, along with visits for some mental health-related care. Depending on reimbursement and technology and security requirements, we foresee telemedicine allowing our tenants to improve their efficiency in providing lower acuity services. It could spur greater access of rural communities to urban care centers and support providers in general as they meet rising demand for high acuity care from an aging population.",
         "CMS remains active on the regulatory front in pursuing several Medicare cost-saving initiatives. These include hospital pricing transparency, site-neutral payments for off-campus hospital-based outpatient care and the addition of newly covered services in outpatient settings. These initiatives incentivize care in lower cost settings typically in medical office buildings and ambulatory surgery centers.",
         "As we approach the Presidential election, we can expect heated public debate over another round of federal stimulus and COVID-19 relief for health care providers. We believe the sector is positioned well, even absent additional legislation, to continue to meet the demands of responding to COVID and deliver the underlying growth in health care services our population will need in the quarters to come.",
         "The results of the election for both the Presidency and Congress could impact the nation\u2019s mix of health insurance coverage and expansion of Medicare and Medicaid. Regardless of election results, we expect the shift of health care delivery will continue toward lower-cost outpatient settings.",
         "Now I will turn it over to Rob Hull for an overview of investment activity. Rob?"

         "Except for the historical information contained within, the matters discussed in this call may contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, assumptions, risks and uncertainties. These risks are more specifically discussed in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2019, and in subsequently filed Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements represent the company\u2019s judgment as of the date of this call. The company disclaims any obligation to update this forward-looking material.",
         "The matters discussed in this call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations, FFO; normalized FFO; FFO per share; normalized FFO per share; funds available for distribution, FAD; net operating income, NOI; EBITDA; and adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the company\u2019s earnings press release for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020. The company\u2019s earnings press release, supplemental information, Forms 10-Q and 10-K are available on the company\u2019s website. Todd?"
      ],
      "Kris Douglas": [
         "Thanks, Rob. Second quarter performance was strong as COVID-related revenue impacts were offset by operating expense controls and G&A reductions. Normalized FFO per share of $0.42 was an increase of 5% over the same period a year ago.",
         "Before diving into the specific operating metrics for the quarter, I will touch on rent collection and deferrals. We saw significant sequential improvements in May, June and July. This was the result of a swift rebound in patient volumes following the end of government-mandated shutdowns early in the quarter. We collected over 99% of second quarter rent, including 2% of deferrals. These deferrals are to be paid back in the second half of the year.",
         "For July, deferrals were less than $100,000 of our over $40 million in monthly rent. In addition, over half of deferrals granted in the second quarter were repaid early, signaling how our tenants are getting back to business. Scheduled rent deferral payments for July are tracking well at 88%. While this is promising, it is early in the process, so we took a $730,000 bad debt reserve, representing 25% of outstanding deferrals at quarter end. We will continue to monitor and analyze collections through the balance of the year and adjust reserves accordingly.",
         "Now shifting to operating performance. Trailing 12-month same-store NOI grew 1.9%, which was impacted by lockdowns in the quarter in 3 main ways. First, there was an $800,000 sequential reduction in transient parking income. Parking volumes returned to approximately 80% of pre-pandemic levels by the end of June. Second, $673,000 of the total rent deferral reserve was in the same-store portfolio. And third and most notable was a benefit of $1 million from a reduction in net operating expenses due to lower building traffic in the quarter. The primary reductions were in maintenance and utilities, which each declined over $0.5 million compared to the previous year.",
         "As utilization in foot traffic has rebounded in June and July, we expect operating expenses to return to more customary third quarter levels, including typical seasonal utilities. But for these 3 impacts, trailing 12-month same-store growth would have been approximately 20 basis points higher. NOI growth in future periods should be reliably strong given the multi-tenant leasing metrics this quarter, including retention of 84.6%, average in-place contractual increases of 2.89% and cash leasing spreads of 4.5%.",
         "In the quarter, we had 179,000 square feet of new leases take occupancy, led by gains at several reposition and development properties. This level of new leasing exceeded our historical average of approximately 100,000 square feet per quarter.",
         "Looking forward, given a slowdown in leasing tours early in the second quarter due to local restrictions, we could see leasing drop below our historical average in the second half of the year. Our same-store guidance reflects the potential for this impact. Moving into 2021, we expect leasing to increase as tours have already rebounded to pre-COVID-19 levels and demand for outpatient space continues to strengthen.",
         "Now shifting to liquidity and leverage. Our FAD dividend payout ratio was 84% for the quarter and 93% for the trailing 12 months. We expect full year 2020 to be in the low 90s and net debt-to-EBITDA improve to 5.1x, including the issuance of $33 million of equity through the ATM. In addition, we entered into forward equity contracts for an additional $74 million. These proceeds can be drawn at our election over the next 12 months. We don\u2019t expect to draw any of the forward equity proceeds until 2021, given the substantial liquidity available to fund our growing investment pipeline.",
         "Our liquidity includes $44 million of cash at quarter end and $244 million from the Mercy dispositions, which closed last week. Our investment in the Mercy properties resulted in an unlevered IRR of 11.5%, while the reinvestment in multi-tenant MOBs, in major MSAs will improve the diversification and growth profile of our portfolio. For example, contractual escalators for the Mercy assets have been running 1.7%, which is more than 100 basis points below our existing portfolio and our acquisition pipeline. The cap rate rotation upon reinvestment will result in a little more than $0.03 of annual dilution. The timing of the reinvestment through the third and fourth quarters will bring forward all of the $0.03-plus into 2020. However, even with this dilution and the COVID-19 impacts discussed earlier, we anticipate positive FFO per share growth in 2020, and we are positioned well for continued FFO per share growth in 2021 and beyond. Todd?"

         "Good day, and welcome to the Healthcare Realty Trust Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Todd Meredith. Please go ahead, sir."
      ],
      "Rob Hull": [
         "Thank you, Bethany. Healthcare Realty\u2019s investment activity during the quarter can be characterized as 2 distinct periods: defense at the outset; and back to offense by the end of the quarter. We started on defense by shoring up liquidity with an agreement to sell 2 single-tenant net lease properties to St. Louis-based Mercy for $244 million or $633 per square foot. What\u2019s also important is that this transaction represents a meaningful shift out of slower-growing properties, in smaller markets and into attractive growing MSAs with significant opportunities for future investment.",
         "Additionally, we took a deeper dive in due diligence for acquisitions rather than terminating contracts and risk losing solid deals because of COVID-19. For example, we doubled the length of inspection periods to monitor the health and stability of these properties. We also conducted extensive tenant interviews over multiple billing cycles. And we analyzed rent collection and deferral requests at buildings under contract, compared it to our own portfolio, and it stacked up really well. These critical steps allowed us to shift to offense as we approach the third quarter.",
         "In July, we closed on 4 MOBs for $83 million. One property marks our first acquisition in the San Diego market, a market where we have identified substantial opportunity for future investment. Another in Los Angeles will benefit from the hospital\u2019s recent affiliation with AA-minus-rated Cedars-Sinai Health System, which will provide an infusion of capital to increase hospital services in this dense market. The last 2, located in Atlanta and Seattle, represent additional investment in attractive growth markets on campuses where we own multiple properties.",
         "All through the quarter, our team continued to use their deep industry relationships to source deals and build a pipeline even as the volume of marketed transactions declined. We now have 10 buildings under 6 separate contracts or letters of intent for an additional $163 million. These targeted acquisitions are located in 6 markets where we already have \u2013 where we already are invested. We expect to close these deals by year-end. And along with properties closed in July, we\u2019ll fully reinvest the $244 million of Mercy proceeds.",
         "Our renewed confidence to proceed with closings and a growing pipeline are driving the increase in our acquisition guidance, up to $300 million to $375 million for the year. We expect our average cap rate to remain between 5% and 5.8%.",
         "The outlook for acquisitions remains positive as health care providers continued to experience meaningful improvement in patient visits and procedures. MOB rent rolls are holding up, allowing sellers to return to the market. Although a few buyers are temporarily on the sidelines, cap rates are steady as investor demand is wide and deep with stable cash flows from MOBs. While several sizable portfolios are available, we haven\u2019t found them compelling enough to deviate from our targeted process of investing in 1 or 2 buildings at a time.",
         "On the development front, we are making steady progress on the $30 million redevelopment project in Memphis. During the course of the pandemic, several tenants expanded their space requirements including the surgery center and a large orthopedic tenant. As a result, the lease percentage has moved up to 94%.",
         "During the first quarter of 2021, we expect exterior improvements to be completed and the building\u2019s anchor tenant to take occupancy. The remainder of the suites will take occupancy throughout the second and third quarters of 2021.",
         "The pandemic has delayed some development discussions, but hospitals are not abandoning long-term expansion plans. For example, in July, a leading health system in Tacoma announced a $300 million investment in a new bed tower. And next week, here in Nashville, Saint Thomas will break ground on its $300 million expansion. We are planning redevelopments at both of these campuses, and we expect to start these projects soon.",
         "I am pleased with our team\u2019s ability to build a solid investment pipeline during these times. Their hard work will lead to the timely reinvestment of proceeds generated from recent sales and positions us well for accretive growth in 2021.",
         "Now I will turn it over to Kris to discuss financial and operational performance for the quarter."

      "Todd Meredith": [
         "Thank you, Chuck. Joining me on the call this morning are Carla Baca, Bethany Mancini, Rob Hull and Kris Douglas. Ms. Baca, if you could now read the disclaimer.",
         "Thank you, Carla. First, I\u2019d like to offer our best wishes to everyone as we approach 5 months since the start of the pandemic. We are encouraged by the positive signs of recovery in the health care space and grateful for those who\u2019ve worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic, including our tenants and partners. They have demonstrated extraordinary resilience, well beyond what we anticipated.",
         "We expect we will continue to contend with COVID-19 as it ebbs and flows. What\u2019s encouraging is the progress of better treatments and promising vaccine developments. Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and many others are reporting positive results from fast track clinical trials. Many expect a successful vaccine in 2020 with widespread availability next year. Public health officials are also taking a much more targeted approach to addressing hot spots, which is allowing health care services to remain open.",
         "Across the country, we are seeing physicians ramp up their volumes quickly, now approaching pre-COVID levels. They are experiencing heightened demand for delayed care. Providers are balancing the delivery of much needed care with safety precautions, and they have gained valuable experience in treating their COVID patients. As a result, we are not seeing the use of lengthy or widespread bans on elective procedures. Several publicly traded national health care companies, including HCA, Surgery Partners and Tenet, have recently reported steady improvements in volumes throughout May, June and July. Likewise, we have seen tenant utilization in our buildings rebound to nearly 90% of pre-COVID levels.",
         "It does vary geographically somewhat from a low of 75% in Washington, D.C. to 100% here in Nashville. Tenant work order requests are now running at pre-COVID levels. And leasing momentum has also rebounded. Tours with prospective tenants, which dip below 50% of typical volumes in April, are now running well above average.",
         "Rent collection stands at 97% for the second quarter as well as July. New deferral requests have fallen to nearly 0 in the last 30 days. And over half of deferrals granted during the second quarter were repaid early, which is very encouraging.",
         "Forgivable PPP loans kicked in as designed for payroll, rent and utilities. The health care sector received more than 12% of all PPP loans, of which the biggest recipients were physician offices at more than $8.4 billion.",
         "HR\u2019s operating results for the second quarter were steady despite the impact of COVID. Strong cash leasing spreads, high tenant retention and stable contractual rent bumps were positive signs of the resiliency of our tenants and the stability of our portfolio.",
         "With tours being well off pace in April and May, occupancy could be marginally softer in the second half of the year. But with a sharp recovery in June and July, we expect occupancy to strengthen going into 2021. As a result, same-store NOI growth will likely be closer to 2% in 2020 and bounce back toward 3% next year.",
         "External growth is still on pace for a solid 2020. The pipeline is strong even after we took extra time to underwrite the financial health of tenants. We\u2019ve increased the top end of our acquisition guidance to be in line with our volume last year and well ahead of our historical average. We have plenty of funding capacity from the Mercy dispositions, cash on hand, forward equity and full availability on our line of credit. We are poised to take advantage of a sizable and growing pipeline.",
         "The pandemic has underscored the critical nature of health care services even in uncertain times. It has shown that hospitals are the hub of essential care, including high acuity outpatient services, which drive the stability of our cash flows. Despite the pandemic, we still expect to produce positive FFO per share growth in 2020. Rising secular demand, a strong balance sheet and a robust pipeline position us well to grow safely in the years ahead.",
         "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Ms. Mancini for some additional commentary on health care trends. Bethany?",
         "Thank you, Kris. Operator, Chuck, we will be ready to open it up to the question-and-answer period."

And I would say the cap rates in those buildings are in a similar range to what we have under contracted pipeline. And certainly, it\u2019s early, and we\u2019re in discussions with those sellers. There are some that sometimes may fall out or take longer to close on, but we have a good line of sight on those and are optimistic about the opportunities there."

It\u2019s probably not 100%, as Rob just said, but maybe it\u2019s 70%, 80% at least. And the nice thing is, I mean, those are ones that are pretty far along in discussions. There\u2019s clearly a lot of other things not in that number that are a little further out there, maybe not as highly probable. So I think it\u2019s \u2013 that number is a strong number, just in general, if you think about productivity going into 2021."

      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I\u2019d say that rather than pricing, just the markets and the systems that they\u2019re associated with. The strength of those markets, the opportunities for growth is really a key piece that we look at. And I would also say that the on-adjacent makeup versus the off makeup, typically, what you see is there\u2019s a number of properties \u2013 a few properties in there that you really like, but then there\u2019s other properties in there that you really don\u2019t like. And I think that\u2019s where these portfolios that are out there kind of fall into now."

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And Nick, I think as we\u2019ve looked at portfolios over the years, we also recognize you can\u2019t always find the perfect portfolio by definition. And so it really comes down to, is there a high-enough proportion of what Rob described as attractive assets that would be worth taking on a few of those things that we don\u2019t like as much? And so we\u2019ve always struggled with that. We obviously think our portfolio reflects a lot of the quality metrics we\u2019re looking for, and we want to improve the average.",
            "But if 70%, 80% of the assets really fit, then I think it makes some sense. And the medicine-only transaction, the Atlanta transaction 3 years ago is a great example of that. We certainly looked at the Duke transaction hard and competed for that. So I\u2019d throw that in there. But some others like CNL and others, we couldn\u2019t get there."

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. I would say that pricing for acquisitions has remained steady. The cash flows in MOBs has held up remarkably well during this period, and I think that\u2019s a testament to the security and reliability of the asset class. And so you\u2019re seeing, again, continued demand for the product. There has been a few buyers that are temporarily on the sidelines, but we see plenty of capital continuing to participate in the space. And so because of that, we just haven\u2019t seen any meaningful movement in cap rates."

So I think that sort of underscores that 5.5% range for typical MOBs, portfolios is very consistent over the last really couple of years. And then occasionally, you see deviations from that more when you get down to specific assets that may drive it towards 5% or less or the other way for lower-quality assets."

So we aren\u2019t as easily able to \u2013 not talk over each other, which I apologize, Kris. But I would say on the dividend, you\u2019re exactly right, Vikram. Kris mentioned low 90s for this year. And certainly, we\u2019re trying to steadily improve that. So we do hope to maintain that level, if not improve it, each year. But as Kris also talked about, we\u2019ve got a lot of leasing strengthening as we go into the later part of this year and into next year.",
            "So we do expect that what probably benefited us, frankly, in the second quarter and maybe even in the third would be a little less spending on TI because of the slowdown in leasing. We see that probably picking right back up later in the year and into next year. So it\u2019s a little early to tell exactly where we\u2019ll be for 2021, but we like the direction generally where we\u2019re headed. And we\u2019ll certainly have a better sense of that as we start putting our plans together for 2021 later this year."

But if we don\u2019t see the continued improvement that we have been seeing in the last several years, it will be tied to that \u2013 be tied to absorption, in new leasing, which is great for long term in terms of earnings and such but could slow the momentum temporarily in terms of continued driving that payout ratio lower.

I mean 2 of the markets that we\u2019ve added, you kind of asked that question about adding markets, we just added San Diego, as Rob pointed out, in the last year.

So it\u2019s a lot of activity in the same markets we\u2019ve been building scale in. And then occasionally, reaching out, like I mentioned, the San Diego, Raleigh, some others like that. There\u2019s probably, Rob, 4 or 5 other markets we\u2019d certainly look at and see some depth in.

I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m overly reading into your commentary, but it sounded like you mentioned a large and growing pipeline. Is there potentially more behind this? Or are there a handful of larger deals that you\u2019re looking at? Because I\u2019m noticing you\u2019ve taken the leverage on a pro forma basis quite low, and I know it\u2019s a challenging environment. So it does make sense.

So our team is out there constantly developing those relationships. We\u2019ve identified buildings that we want to own. And we have dialogue with the sellers or brokers in those markets that we trust and are constantly trying to get those sellers to the table. So we think that behind what we\u2019ve laid out here, certainly, there\u2019s more opportunity that we\u2019re working on.

In terms of the new acquisitions that we\u2019re looking at, the escalators, as I mentioned, are pretty similar to what our existing portfolio is, call it the 2 8 to 2 9 range in terms of escalators. And it varies on the impact of \u2013 to GAAP based off of the term that is inside of our acquisitions.

And so I think we all feared obviously in the front end that hospitals would just be totally overwhelmed. And obviously, that was tested in a couple of places including New York. And I think the good news is we came out on the better end of what we all feared. And so you\u2019re seeing it, as you said, in hot spots, Houston went through it, and you\u2019re seeing it in different places. And the good news is they seem to be handling it. And it\u2019s not creating these long, lengthy shutdowns. You did see in Texas, the governor trying to push some, again, policies there. But it really actually was a bit of a carve-out for ASCs and some of the outpatient surgeries. It was more about protecting that inpatient capacity.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nationwide shut it all down, the way it was early on. It\u2019s going to be much more targeted. And I\u2019m no expert any more than anybody on the phone, but as we watch this move around the country, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s the hot spot. It\u2019s these fires that kind of come up and then burn out. And I hope that continues to be quelled and contained. But I think it\u2019s very encouraging what we\u2019re seeing. And even though we might experience some issues, I think we\u2019re encouraged. I mean the public companies that report their surgery numbers have been really incredible.",
            "So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a big hesitation to come back and do it. It will just be a matter of the public health officials continue to sort of treat this in a targeted way rather than a blanket way. And we think that will be the case."

And maybe this fast tracks some consolidation or closings that probably or maybe would have happened eventually? I\u2019m just wondering if you think sort of picking your relationships becomes even more important in the aftermath because the hospital industry overall is probably a notch weaker because of everything that happened?"

We were having a discussion with our Board earlier this week about that with several health system leaders there on our Board. And I think it\u2019s what you said. You\u2019re going to \u2013 it\u2019s the classic problem that these crises, just like the financial crisis caused. The strong are going to get stronger, the weak are going to get weaker, and there\u2019s different dynamics to that. But in the hospital world, that\u2019s very true. And you\u2019re seeing HCA do extremely well coming through this. And I think they do a good job of figuring it out. And there\u2019s a lot of not-for-profit systems that are leaders in their markets.",
            "I do think that strength and scale matters. Larger systems versus small independent system, obviously, more urban versus \u2013 and suburban versus rural is going to be a huge trend. I know the trend of moving into the cities, everybody is questioning a little bit. But I still think those strong population growth centers are going to be where you\u2019re going to see the success. And so I do think you are correct that picking the right partners will matter more. Being a sharpshooter will continue to be critical for success. And I think that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been honing ever since we sort of found that trend to be true from the financial crisis and even before.",
            "So it\u2019s true. I do think you\u2019re right, hospitals probably taken \u2013 have clearly taken a hit and were helped a lot by the CARES Act and CMS in general. But I do think we are encouraged that the strong ones \u2013 I mean this is a demand, need-based business. This isn\u2019t just selling luxury items. It\u2019s very much need-based. And so there\u2019s a huge need for \u2013 as I made my comments or remarks that \u2013 I mean hospitals are proving that they\u2019re so critical, and I think the acuity level at hospitals is only going to continue to climb, and you\u2019re going to see acuity level at outpatient climb, both on and off-campus. It\u2019s a continuum. And I think all those innovations will continue, and it will be a little bit more of a winner versus loser game.

We just haven\u2019t seen it is the real answer. It has all the makings to suggest that would be possibly true.

It\u2019s a little different.",

They don\u2019t focus \u2013 I mean, as they should, they focus on providing care and all the things they need to do to expand their business and succeed. They\u2019re not sitting around thinking about cap rates for MOBs. But I think there\u2019s going to be \u2013 there are going to be some more of those.

It\u2019s 2.89% for the multi-tenant. So that\u2019s the driver of our same-store growth. And what Kris always walks through is, okay, we grew the revenue at that level. And then you\u2019re right, you advance that ball a little bit with cash leasing spreads. But that\u2019s a pretty small piece of the pie each quarter or a year. So you do help that.",

And then really, it becomes, what are your expenses doing? And how much operating leverage do you have in your margin? And so that\u2019s the algorithm we see that gets us there pretty conservatively with it \u2013 but it\u2019s really \u2013 the big driver is our revenue model of our escalators, and we continue to feel good about that. The cash leasing spreads help at the margin absolutely.",

Are you still on track to close that remaining $70 million or so? Or have any of those deals fall apart?"

And all that is what we\u2019ve heard some others say too. We had slower tours and new leasing activity with new prospective net new tenants that create absorption, which is where you have higher TI spend in the second quarter, especially April and even a little in May. And therefore, you get this lag effect of when those tenants would normally take occupancy, and that\u2019s probably a third and fourth quarter phenomenon. So it\u2019s really a back half issue and even a little bit you saw in the second quarter. So that\u2019s all we\u2019re saying. And then back to sort of normalized levels in 2021."

            "I would clarify that, too. That\u2019s a little bit on the prospective leasing front, what Todd is talking about of \u2013 and we don\u2019t know for sure. We\u2019re kind of running different scenarios, and so we\u2019re looking at one scenario that, yes, we could see a little bit less absorption here in the next couple of quarters and then rebounding, which could have an impact. But then also, if you look at it in terms of total spend and you start looking at FAD right now, we are running at the low end and frankly a little below the low end of our guidance range as it relates to second-gen TI. And so there\u2019s just timing that is always related to that. So that may pick up. Certainly, we think we\u2019ll be in the range back to potentially near the midpoint of the range.",
            "And so that\u2019s part of what is playing into the guidance as it relates to FAD. In my prepared remarks, I talked about, right now, we are running significantly below where we are on a trailing 12-month basis. But we do think that, that can pick up in the later half of the year and what drives our view that our FAD payout ratio will probably end up the year down in the low 90s, not in the low 80s that you saw this quarter. So I just wanted to clarify that point."

            "Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the transaction. It makes perfect sense to me. My focus is really on the outlook for the MOBs. I think you mentioned in your comments earlier on that hospitals in general and associated MOBs seem to be doing well when we kind of think about HCA results and some of the other hospital operators. But a lot of that is also kind of due to the massive amount of grants they\u2019ve kind of received over this period as well.",

I mean specifically, could we start to see deferrals going up again? Or would love for you to just kind of expand on that."

            "Right. Right. So April was just absolutely extreme. And clearly, the government steps in, and we just hope we don\u2019t see that again. But I think we\u2019ve \u2013 as I mentioned, we\u2019ve learned a lot. And I think we learned that hospitals, good or bad, hospitals and physicians, they really make a lot of money on the elective procedure side and surgeries. And when that was shut down, I mean, you\u2019re cutting off the most profitable segment of the business.",
            "And health care, it\u2019s a little cold to say that because obviously, they\u2019re only doing \u2013 they\u2019re only supposed to be doing what\u2019s necessary. But it is necessary. There\u2019s a ton of that need. And so when you cut off that lifeblood, if you will, it really hurts the system. So I think now, if you go back to the discussions earlier, where it\u2019s more of a targeted approach and maybe for a short period in Houston, they asked for some elective procedures to be reduced and not even in all ASCs but in hospitals. So I think you\u2019re going to see a more targeted approach rather than the sort of absolute month-long or more shutdowns. So it should \u2013 therefore, it shouldn\u2019t be quite as financially difficult.",
            "Is it going to be tough? Yes, just like schools. Schools for a lot of us with kids, it\u2019s going to be tough as soon as they shut down the school for a week or 2 or something, or even if you\u2019re lucky if they\u2019re open. So there\u2019s going to be ebbs and flows, as I mentioned in my remarks. But I think we\u2019re in much better shape today than we were when we knew very little in March.",
            "So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as dire as we could all fear, but it\u2019s never \u2013 David Emery always say, it\u2019s never as good or as bad as it may seem, and that\u2019s probably very appropriate here. It will be not easy, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as bad as it was. And it\u2019s not changing our outlook about hospitals and on-campus MOBs. We\u2019ll watch that, just like everybody. But I think in my own experience, personally, if you\u2019ve ever dealt with a family member or a friend or loved one, whatever it might be, who\u2019s had a serious illness, you don\u2019t think twice about going to the hospital or going to that high acuity specialists that might be near the hospital.",
            "When it gets real, that\u2019s what this is about. The light touch stuff, and it\u2019s really cool that there\u2019s innovations that can do things in lower-cost off-campus settings, and that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s a very real thing. And not to say that trend is not real, but we think the dynamics of real estate and demand \u2013 supply and demand are best where it\u2019s that high acuity sort of nucleus, if you will, around the hospital. And as Rich asked, we got to watch that nucleus, make sure it\u2019s healthy, the hospitals that we\u2019re working with. So that\u2019s our focus."
