      "Christopher Meyer": [
         "Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our Q2 results, I want to provide some perspective on recent sales trends and how we are successfully navigating the current environment. We began the process of reopening our dining rooms in early May in accordance with state and local guidelines. As of this morning, 92% of our company-operated restaurants have dining rooms opened and effectively all of these locations are operating with some level of reduced seating capacity.",
         "As these dining rooms have reopened, we have seen steady improvement in the same store sales results throughout our portfolio, while we were operating with an off-premises only business model in late April, our combined U.S.-comp sales were down approximately 50%. Over the last few weeks, our combined U.S.-comp sales results have been down between 17% and 19%. Importantly, over the last 3 weeks, we have been able to retain over 50% of the off-premises volumes that we built while our dining rooms were closed in April. We are pleased with the improvement in our sales trends as well as our ability to maintain a significant portion of our off-premises growth.",
         "Recently, there\u2019s been an escalation in COVID-19 cases, particularly in states such as Florida, Texas and California. We are paying close attention to developments in these states, especially Florida, where we have 21% of our company-owned restaurants. To this point, the increase in COVID cases has not had a material impact on our Florida comp sales results. Month-to-date July comp sales in Florida have been roughly in line with the balance the system. In addition, we have seen little change in Florida trends from where we were in June.",
         "We are seeing similar trends in Texas. In California, where we have a large Outback franchise presence, as well as 20% of our Fleming\u2019s locations, we are seeing more of a sales impact as that state is largely open for off-premises only. It is important to recognize that this is a rapidly changing environment both in terms of the number of COVID cases, as well as the response being put in place by some state and local governments.",
         "As we have shown throughout this pandemic, we will stay agile with our business model and prioritize taking care of our people and serving food in a safe environment that protects both our team members and our customers.",
         "Turning now to Q2 financial performance. Total revenues decreased 43% to $578 million. Combined U.S.-comp sales for the quarter were down 39.4%. GAAP diluted loss per share for the quarter was $1.05 versus $0.32 of diluted earnings per share in 2019. Adjusted diluted loss per share was $0.74 versus $0.36 of adjusted diluted earnings per share last year. As it relates to our operating expenses, there were a few areas worth calling out.",
         "Since the onset of this pandemic, we have been focused on simplification efforts to improve efficiency and lower costs. This has had a positive impact on several areas of our P&L. For example, despite lower overall check averages, cost of goods sold was only 10 basis points higher than last year. The streamlined menus we have utilized since the onset of this pandemic have helped to reduce food waste to record low levels. The labor line also benefited from our simplification efforts.",
         "Hourly labor as a percentage of sales was down 190 basis points in June from pre-COVID levels, excluding relief pay paid to hourly employees. This improvement was driven by a reduction in food prep hours. Operating expenses were higher due to sales deleveraging and increases in to-go and cleaning supplies. These increases were offset by $23 million reduction in marketing expense within the quarter. Despite the significant deleveraging in our P&L from lower sales, our focus on expense controls allowed us to generate positive restaurant level operating margin in the quarter.",
         "On the G&A front, Q2 was down $19 million from last year net of adjustments. This included a roughly $5 million benefit from the cancellation of our Managing Partners\u2019 Conference in 2020. Other areas of benefit within G&A include a significant reduction in travel expenses related to COVID, as well as the ongoing impact of our cost savings initiatives that we discussed in our February earnings call.",
         "Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31.2%. This is a product of our negative pre-tax income as well as additional tax credits such as our FICA tip credit. One other P&L item worth noting is our other revenues category, which is down $14 million year-over-year due to lower royalties and marketing contributions from franchisees. We have been actively working with our franchise partners throughout this pandemic. Each situation is unique, but as we work through potential franchise assistance options, we are going to record royalty income as the cash is received, instead of recording a receivable. When sales and profit trends improve, we would expect a corresponding increase in royalty and marketing contributions.",
         "We permanently closed 30 restaurants within the quarter, including 25 company-owned locations and 5 franchise locations. Impairments related to these closures as well as other fixed assets impairments, restructuring charges and inventory spoilage made up most of the adjustments to EPS within the quarter.",
         "Turning to our balance sheet. Since our last update on June 11, we have improved our total liquidity position to $502 million, which includes $138 million of domestic cash and $364 million of availability on our revolving credit facility. Our improved sales performance combined with steps taken to tightly manage our cash usage has enhanced our liquidity and provides us ample financial flexibility moving forward. Given this stability, we do not intend to provide interim financial updates before we report our Q3 earnings.",
         "In summary, although this situation has been challenging, our improving trends amid this pandemic reinforces the relevance and strong consumer appeal of our brands. And we are looking forward to emerging as a better, stronger operations-focused company. And with that, we will open up the call for questions."

      "David Deno": [
         "Well, thank you, Mark, and welcome to everyone listening today. Our priorities remain unchanged as we continue to navigate these challenging times. We are focused on taking care of our people and serving food in a safe environment that protects both our team members and customers.",
         "The investments made over the past several years to enhance the customer experience and rapidly pursue the emerging delivery opportunity have been critical to our success in navigating this pandemic. At the onset in March, we were able to quickly pivot to an off-premises-only business model as dining rooms were forced to close. The rapid growth we experienced in off-premises sales allowed us to keep substantially all of our locations open during this time.",
         "Starting in May, states began the process of partially re-opening their economies. Our decision not to furlough or layoff any employee during this pandemic has allowed us to quickly prepare our restaurants to re-open dining rooms in a safe and efficient manner. As of July 19, 2020, almost all of our U.S. company-operated restaurants have reopened with limited in-restaurant dining capacity.",
         "During this time, we continue to maintain elevated safety measures including additional sanitation and disinfecting practices, using gloves and facial protection for our employees, as well as contactless payment options for our customers. In addition, dining room seating configuration has been modified to adhere to social distancing and reduce capacity standards.",
         "Customers have responded in taking notice of these additional safety measures. This has translated to improving demand, as overall weekly sales have consistently increased since dining rooms reopened.",
         "At Outback, for the most recent week ending July 19, comparable restaurant sales were down 10.7% versus the prior year in locations that have reopened with limited in-restaurant dining capacity.",
         "Importantly, these locations are also maintaining a high off-premises mix with both delivery and to go. We will continue to leverage our strong capabilities to retain the off-premises growth we achieved during the pandemic. Off-premises remains a large opportunity and a significant part of the go-forward strategy.",
         "The improved sales recovery, coupled with disciplined cost management, enabled us to generate positive cash flow in June. This represents a great step in stabilizing the business and rightsizing our cost structure. The pandemic forced us to operate the business differently, which provides an opportunity to reassess the operating model.",
         "One area we are gaining additional insights is around simplification. This encompasses everything from optimizing the menu and enhancing the labor model to the marketing strategy and how we support our restaurants. These efforts have contributed to reduce complexity, improve consistency, and increase profitability across revenue channels.",
         "We are leveraging these learnings to drive more operating efficiency in the restaurant in the current environment and as we emerge in a post COVID world. None of this progress would be possible without the terrific work done by our team members in the restaurants and the dedicated employees in the restaurant support center. They\u2019ve remained incredibly nimble and agile in finding ways to support guests, as we navigate through this challenging environment.",
         "The enthusiasm and commitment they offer every day to bring life to life hospitality, service and experience is what makes our restaurants so successful. Thank you to everyone for all your hard work.",
         "Turning to Brazil, much like the U.S. and the rest of the world, the Brazilian economy is being impacted from the effects of the pandemic. The country has seen increases in reported COVID cases, which resulted in states and local governments enacting measures to reduce the spread of the virus. This included the closure of restaurant dining rooms, and a shift to an off-premises-only model.",
         "It is more difficult to execute off-premises in Brazil, given that most of our restaurants are located within malls. During this time, we were able to successfully build a carry-off business from scratch in just a few short weeks. Recently, as in the U.S., dining rooms are beginning to safely reopen, and more than 70% of our locations are offering in-restaurant dining.",
         "For the weekend of July 19, comparable restaurant sales at Brazil Outback locations with in-restaurant dining were down 44%. We continue to see an increase in sales volumes and the team is actively addressing cost opportunities to manage cash. Based on current trends, we believe our Brazilian business has adequate liquidity to navigate through this pandemic, and we do not anticipate any further cash infusions into the business.",
         "Outback remains resilient and continues to be one of the highest regarded brands by consumers in Brazil.",
         "In summary, our goal is to emerge as a stronger company and more formidable competitor on the other side of this crisis. We will accomplish this with the following priorities in mind. First, continue to upgrade our food, menu, and service in all of our brands. We made significant investments against these areas over the past 4 years to enhance brand positioning.",
         "This cycle of continuous improvement is aimed at enhancing our value proposition to consumers while taking minimal pricing.",
         "Second, continue to capture the opportunities in our industry-leading delivery and carry-off business. This pandemic has proven the importance of this channel and the role of convenience for our consumers. We are focused on leveraging our strong off-premises capabilities to further grow this opportunity.",
         "Third, make even more progress in our marketing and digital technology efforts. For example, we are making changes to the online ordering platform to enhance stability and performance in this critical channel. We\u2019ve also implemented new tools that will enable us to pursue targeted digital marketing efforts that provide a high return on investment.",
         "Fourth, lead the way in taking care of our people and providing the benefits they need, attracting and keeping a talented and diverse workforce is the key to success in this business. Fifth, continue to enhance our liquidity position and strengthen the balance sheet. Our improved sales performance combined with the recent bond offering and steps taken to tightly manage cash has enhanced our liquidity position. This also provides ample financial flexibility moving forward and enables us to capitalize on future opportunities.",
         "And finally, we will accomplish all this while adhering to strict safety measures, protecting team members and customers remain the top priority. We want consumers to feel safe in any channel, whether that is in our restaurants or in the convenience of their own home.",
         "And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris."

         "Thank you and good morning, everyone. With me on today\u2019s call are: David Deno, our Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Meyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. By now, you should have access to our fiscal second quarter 2020 earnings release. It can also be found on our website at bloominbrands.com in the Investors section.",
         "Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting results on an adjusted basis. An explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures appear in our earnings release on our website, as previously described.",
         "Before we begin formal remarks, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including a discussion of recent performance. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.",
         "Some of these risks are mentioned in our earnings release. Others are discussed in our SEC filings, which are available at sec.gov. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll provide a brief recap of our financial performance for the fiscal second quarter 2020 and a discussion regarding current trends. Once we\u2019ve completed these remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.",

         "Remarks": [
            "I had 2 questions; 1 question, 1 follow-up actually. The question just being on the restaurant margin, you talk about the relative resilience and the low-single-digit positive margin despite the quarterly U.S. comp down 40%-ish. Just wondering if you can give any more color on the greatest area maybe of relative strength. And if the comp stabilized at the current, I guess, you\u2019re running down in the teens levels, what do you think is the appropriate restaurant margin, whether you can share sensitivity or perhaps what was the comp in margin specifically in June, so we have a frame of reference?",
            "Obviously, the comps swung wildly through the second quarter, so it\u2019s hard to assess. But if you can give kind of a current status in terms of what the margin would be on the relative comp, that will be great. And then I have 1 follow-up."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Jeffrey Bernstein"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah, we\u2019ll dig in and figure out what the P6 margin was. We can give you that perspective. But what I would to tell you, Jeff, is our goal, the efficiencies that we saw, certainly in P6, our goal is to retain as much of that efficiency as possible as we move forward. We learned a tremendous amount over this time period about ways that we can do things more effectively, more efficiently.",
            "A lot of it was driven by the menu simplification work. That\u2019s absolutely something we want to preserve moving forward, that\u2019s going to help in cost of goods sold in terms of waste reduction, and it\u2019s going to help in labor in terms of fewer prep hours. So those areas are absolutely key focuses for us.",
            "The other big toggle that when you look at the restaurant operating expense line is your marketing expense, and And I think that we\u2019re just going to have to play a wait-and-see approach as it relates to marketing. Obviously, if we have high ROI ideas related to \u2013 that we feel are worth pursuing, we\u2019re going to invest marketing dollars behind those.",
            "But right now with the restaurants at limited capacity, they\u2019re fairly full. We don\u2019t feel the necessity to really invest a lot of marketing dollars at this point in time. But moving forward, that could change. And obviously, that could change our perspective on how we invest marketing dollars. But if you look at the P&L, certainly in Q2, the marketing pickup, the $23 million we call out in terms of marketing expense efficiency is a big, big driver.",
            "In terms of P6, restaurant margins were 13.5%. Last year, it was 16.1%. So obviously, we made a lot of progress there. Now, again, keep in mind that as you think about P4, P5, P6, there are some changes in terms of fixed and variable costs because P6 is a 5-week period as opposed to 4-week periods that you\u2019d see in the other periods."

         "Remarks": [
            "Got it, but the idea that period 6 had a 13% plus restaurant margin, and comps are seemingly in line to a little bit better than that now. It\u2019s not unreasonable to assume you could sustain a double-digit restaurant margin in the back half of the year or is that something very unique to P6 where you\u2019re likely to see restaurant margins pullback meaningfully?"

            "Yeah, look, I think at these volume levels, we\u2019ve obviously proven that we can generate positive cash flow in this environment, but I think a lot of our go-forward profitability is going to depend on what fixed costs come back into our business, and we talked about marketing, but other things like training expenses, travel expenses, things that maybe hit a little below the restaurant margin line, those are all things that we have to weigh in terms of when we bring those things back into the fold.",
            "And as the situation improves, we\u2019re going to evaluate which of these levers, if any, we will deploy throughout the year with the goal being that we\u2019re going to set ourselves up for success when we emerge from this pandemic."

            "Yeah, I think, Jeff, what it really points to is what a terrific job our team is doing. If you look at the change in sales trends, obviously, consumers want to come and enjoy in-restaurant dining. So, you see the improvement in sales trends during the quarter. You see the off-premises business continuing to do well, and you see a corresponding improvement in profitability. That\u2019s what we hope to do the balance of the year, and our team is doing a great job getting that done."

         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. And then my follow-up just on that exact point, being in New York, we don\u2019t see a lot of people keen to go out for in-restaurant dining, but I get the impression a lot of markets are different. So, Florida and Texas specifically, I know you talked about capacity reductions really having a minimal impact on the overall sales trends, which is very encouraging.",
            "I was wondering whether there\u2019s any incremental color on that or maybe other states are seeing some pressure with the press on the broader infection spike across the U.S. or, like you said, maybe you just don\u2019t see the slowdown because you\u2019re still at limited capacity. And therefore, the demand is still exceeding the seating capacity even though there might be some signs of a consumer pullback. Any kind of color on that would be great."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah, Jeff, what we\u2019ve learned is when you open appropriately with in-restaurant dining in a clean, safe environment for consumers; you offer the food that we offer and the service that we offer, people want to come on our restaurants. And Chris mentioned on the prepared remarks that the sales trends were good in Florida, Texas. There hasn\u2019t been an appreciable change.",
            "Our team continues to do a great job in the restaurants, providing a great environment for our customers. And people want to come in and enjoy some dining. I mean, it\u2019s clearly what we\u2019re seeing. And so, we hope to continue to see that going forward. We\u2019re certainly going to do our part to provide a great environment for our customers and our employees."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. And just a little color on the geographic trends that you brought up. I think generally speaking, states that opened up early have outperformed, Tennessee, Georgia, a lot of the states that have outperformed have been in the south. We actually had 129 restaurants across the portfolio post positive comps this past week. And over half of those were in the south.",
            "The Midwest is also doing pretty well candidly, Ohio in particular. But to the point you raised, the Northeast does remain challenged. Certainly as in-restaurant dining has been slower to resume and in some cases, not even reopened yet. And then the other thing I would call out is what we called out in the prepared remarks in terms of California, the closure of those dining rooms, certainly from a company-owned perspective, and Fleming\u2019s is having an outsized effect on the comp."

            "I guess, I mean, it\u2019s been really impressive to see how quickly Outback, in particular, has rebounded in its comp trends. I\u2019m just curious as you think about the components of the business and how seating capacity is impacting results. Where are the hurdles for your 4 concepts in kind of getting back to pre-coronavirus levels? So like for Fleming\u2019s is alcohol a big component that you can\u2019t recapture?",
            "I\u2019m just trying to figure out like how far you can go in the current environment, because it\u2019s been very impressive, but I\u2019m not sure how much further low-hanging fruit if there is any left?"

            "Thank you, Sharon for that. Yeah, we do believe we can go further in the current environment. What we have seen is the capacity constraints on the weekends during higher volumes, right? That will hold us back a little bit. So we\u2019ve seen some of that.",
            "Our beer, liquor, wine mix is not quite as high as it once was. But we\u2019re working very hard on that. But I look at the ingenuity of our people. I\u2019m thinking about in particular Fleming\u2019s Prime Steakhouse and what they\u2019re doing with outdoor dining, what more things we can do with our marketing programs. We\u2019re really leaning hard into digital, and we\u2019re learning a lot. That\u2019s helping us on marketing.",
            "So, Sharon, I guess, the main point is what we\u2019re trying to lean forward is, we\u2019re trying to lean forward in keeping our large share of our off-premises business. We\u2019re trying to really plus up our digital marketing efforts. We\u2019re trying to be nimble like Fleming\u2019s is with their work in dining, in in-restaurant dining. And I think our hurdles are the capacity on the weekends and then rebuilding our beer, liquor and wine mix."

And then, for Bonefish, is there anything in particular you\u2019d call out? I mean, is it, generally, used for more celebratory experiences and we\u2019re just not seeing as many of those currently or why do you think Bonefish has lagged Carrabba\u2019s and Outback?"

            "Yeah, well, I think the main thing there is they\u2019ve done a fantastic job getting your off-premises business going, which really didn\u2019t exist prior to the pandemic. But it\u2019s still \u2013 their share of off-premise business is still less than what you\u2019d see at Outback and at Carrabba\u2019s.",
            "In addition, it\u2019s a concept that enjoys a robust alcohol mix in their business and we haven\u2019t been able to build that all the way back. But when you look at in-restaurant dining, which gives us so much heart, the Bonefish team is doing just as well as the other casual dining brands in their in-restaurant dining performance.",
            "On Fleming\u2019s, I don\u2019t have off the top of my head how much is business dining. But I know the team is working very hard to kind of rethink that. And one of the things that\u2019s been a really cool innovation is, they\u2019ve had some success with virtual Fleming\u2019s dining, and we\u2019ve done some of that. So it\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019re really trying to innovate around the core share."

And then obviously, we shifted to an off-premises only model in March, and obviously, those investments that we\u2019ve made and that have paid off in a really big way. We tripled the off-premises business, and it peaked at about $32 million a week in off-premises in April prior to the dining rooms reopening.",

So the question is really on simplification broadly. And you did kind of highlight your menu simplification work, less waste around COGS, your prep hours around labor, and obviously, less marketing. I understand that most of that is going to stay, but my question is how much more you have to go? Is there more that you can do on the menu? Is there more that you can do around not just reducing hours around prep, but actually changing some of the structure of both the back of the house and the front of the house of really reducing the number of labor hours on a given level of your customer transaction versus what you\u2019ve done before.",

Number one, you have to make sure at your restaurants are set up for success. So to-go rooms making sure the assets are laid out to delivery and everything else. That\u2019s number one. Number two is, our digital marketing efforts and our partnerships with third-party providers in our own work is really underway and we\u2019re very happy with our partnerships with our third-party providers, and we\u2019ll continue to work through that.",
            "Number three is, we don\u2019t want to wish misfortunate any restaurant company, but there will be changes in the restaurant footprint and we\u2019re going to have a chance to reposition assets, relocate restaurants, which was so successful for us prior to this, but there\u2019s going to be more opportunities. So we\u2019ll be able to put our restaurants in a more convenient place, the more updated restaurants. We\u2019re certainly going to pursue that.",
            "And then on the operating front, I know, all of our brand leaders are thinking very carefully about how they can think through even provide even better delivery and to-go service and their labor models. I think those are the things that we\u2019re doing to make sure that this is really top of mind. And I just think it\u2019s also a mindset. I spent a number of years in Pizza Hut delivery, and yes, they have a mindset about doing delivery and stuff.",

We\u2019re very \u2013 we have measurements against that. We take a look at what\u2019s going on there. Two, the plexiglass is in place appropriately in our restaurants. Three, outdoor dining is clearly in place and we\u2019ve got some great pictures from our people doing some really creative outdoor dining things. We\u2019ve got a restaurant up in Chicago, for instance, the Bonefish Grill, it just is doing an amazing job in their outdoor dining. Having \u2013 with the dining room is virtually closed, they\u2019re doing volumes even higher than what they were doing prior to all this.",

            "Yeah. It probably makes sense to give you some of the relative components of the Q2 G&A. So you can get some perspective on kind of what sticks and what doesn\u2019t. So to your point, there was about $19 million of favorability year-over-year in G&A. There are 2 buckets that you probably want to break that down into. In February, obviously, we laid out the anticipated $20 million of cost savings that we\u2019re going to benefit our 2020 results.",
            "Most of those savings are going to hit in G&A. So those savings are all on track. In Q2, we had nearly $11 million of benefits related to those efforts. And so $5 million of that we talked about, which was the cancellation of the managing partners\u2019 conference. You had about $2.5 million of lower professional fees and legal fees, and then you had lower compensation expense as we work to reduce our overhead that was about $3.5 million.",
            "The conference expenses and the professional fees are largely isolated to the second quarter. But I think you can expect the compensation benefits to continue throughout the year. The other large bucket of G&A savings related to efficiency gained during COVID. So specifically, there\u2019s probably about $7 million in total related to reduced travel, reduced meetings expense, lower training expenses, and then lower compensation expense.",
            "So it really depends in terms of those expenses on a go forward basis. How long this pandemic carries on because the longer that we\u2019re able to see some of these efficiencies in meeting expense and travel expense, obviously, that\u2019s going to benefit our G&A numbers moving forward as well. But at some point in time, as this business continues to normalize, those expenses will be reintroduced back into the business. So some of it, for sure, the $3.5 million, I think, is absolutely safe to say, it\u2019s going to continue. But beyond that, it really honestly depends."

It\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to continue to support. And also think through how we can take it forward.

So you glossed over this briefly earlier, when you were thinking \u2013 when you were talking about some changes to your portfolio. But could you delve a little deeper into how you\u2019re thinking about the current portfolio, not just in terms of brands. But also in terms of the existing units that you have what needs to be done structurally at these units? Are you having conversations with landlords, either about the existing rents or that future projects and what that could mean for your unit economics going forward?",
            "And then when you think about where you are now, do you think you still need to pare down additional units? When do you think returning to unit growth makes more sense? Or do you think optimization is probably something we think about for 2020 and 2021? Thanks."

There\u2019s going to be opportunities in the marketplace. And we\u2019re very well positioned for that. I think everybody who\u2019s listened to these calls over the years now, our relocation program is very successful, and we anticipate that going forward. As far as optimization of assets, I think, Chris, and the finance team, along with our real estate team has done a really good job staying on top of anything that needed to be closed or addressed. I really don\u2019t anticipate much in that area. Going forward, we\u2019re very pleased with our portfolio. Now I think that the Outbacks business in particular is an opportunity for us as we get into beyond this pandemic to grow it.",

But we are taking the opportunity to restructure leases and reduce our cost structure. And we\u2019re pursuing that with some gusto, and our team is doing a wonderful job there. So Brett, there\u2019s a cost saving opportunity. And then there\u2019s an investment opportunity behind relocations, new units, et cetera."

And do you think that what percentage of the portfolio do you think has the \u2013 really the box and the bones right now, where that makes sense and how much of it has to be adjusted or relocated or just something that you\u2019ll just have to work through the current infrastructure?

And so we\u2019ve worked very hard at making sure our assets were in their construction to make sure that we can deliver and have carry-out. Now, we can always make it better. And that\u2019s one of the things I mentioned earlier about looking at relocations or looking at bump outs and things.",
            "But, for us, there are very few restaurants that need major structural changes to achieve the delivery and carry-out opportunities we have. And you see that in our numbers. I mean, you see that in the sales gains we\u2019ve seen.",
            "Now, before all this started, we had identified up to 100 Outbacks that could be relocated for many different reasons, better dine-in, better delivery, newer assets, everything else. And so, we\u2019re going to pursue that, like I mentioned earlier, with a great deal of determination. But I can assure you that the asset configurations we have today can achieve those sales volumes in delivery and carry-out, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be seeing those numbers. We\u2019re going to continue to improve that though going forward."

Or you\u2019ve already begun to dial it back from maybe earlier on in those higher peak levels? Or is the sort of a 50% of \u2013 holding those 50% is sort of in a comparable promotional environment?

So the check is going to be kind of funky. But if you look at the entrees, is there anything there that you can see as far as reading into that consumer?",

Are you appealing to you think, as broad of a demographic in off-premise as you are historically have in the in-store?

And the great thing is we have all this information.",

            "So, Matt, I would say, basically, in summary, people that use our existing systems either to-go or in-house delivery tend to be our more usual customers, and the people that use the third-party aggregators are some of our newer people in our business."

And so, there\u2019s no cap per se on the advertising piece as long as we get the returns that we\u2019re looking for. But we\u2019ve made a pretty big investment in digital.
