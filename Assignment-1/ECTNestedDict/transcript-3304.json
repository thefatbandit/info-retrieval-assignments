      "Brad Green": [
         "Thank you, Jennifer and good morning to everyone. In addition to Jennifer, on the call today, we have our CFO, Joe Leeder.",
         "I'm going to begin with a brief discussion of our business highlights in the quarter. Joe will follow with a more detailed review of our financial results. I'll then attempt to explain the impact of the pandemic on the second quarter, as well as what we might expect the impact to be on our operations for the remainder of the year. After our prepared remarks, we'll of course open it up to take your questions.",
         "We had an exceptional quarter especially considering the challenging environment. Revenue of $85 million, adjusted EBITDA of $19.5 million and comparable growth in revenue at our businesses of 7.3% is a direct result of the hard work dedication and commitment of our Park Lawn team. As I said in our press release, we've grown together as a team and an organization and we've laid a strong foundation and we intend to continue to build on it.",
         "In addition to our strong operating performance in the quarter in early July, we also managed to strengthen our balance sheet by completing an $86.3 million senior unsecured debenture financing. After using the proceeds to pay down our credit facility, our leverage ratio was reduced to approximately 1.5 times. Including our cash on hand the financing gives us approximately $175 million in liquidity to pursue acquisitions which is precisely what we are now doing.",
         "With that brief introduction, I'll now -- I'd like to turn the call over to Joe to review our financial results in more detail. Joe?",
         "Thanks, Joe. When we last spoke in mid-May, which by the way seems like the far distant past during a pandemic, there was still some significant uncertainty as to the impact of COVID-19 in our company. Fortunately things are more, clear today. And even though some uncertainty remains, we feel like we're in a position to effectively address any challenges presented, by operating in this current COVID environment.",
         "All of our businesses, including our support offices have remained open to serve our families. And now back to that conversation in May, I mentioned several factors that we believe could impact our business and those factors did in fact continue to tell the story of the rest of the quarter.",
         "First, we saw a drop in cemetery pre-need sales. Then we saw a stabilization, and then we saw a very strong recovery, which we're still experiencing. Our sales staff's ability to adapt and leverage technology along with the pandemic being a trigger event to get the conversation on pre-need started led to the strong recovery in cemetery pre-need property sales. By strong recovery, I mean, that the pre-need sales almost fully recovered to be equal quarter-over-quarter by the end of June.",
         "Second, we saw a decrease in the average funeral sale which remained a constant through the quarter mainly due to size of service restrictions imposed by regulatory mandates. Again, this decrease was mitigated by our team members' ability to adapt and leverage technology such as webcasting at funeral services.",
         "As a side note, we had many families that chose to defer services for a later date and we're announcing those families followed through with scheduling those services. So, some of this revenue will be recouped in the next two quarters or so.",
         "The third factor I mentioned in mid-May was that, we were seeing significant increase in our at-need volume in our New Jersey Colorado and Michigan businesses or so-called hotspots in the U.S. As the quarter progressed, however, there were other markets that saw an increase in at-need services that may or may not have been related to COVID-19.",
         "This increase in volume occurred in both the funeral and cemetery side of our businesses. Interestingly, the cemetery at-need average actually increased to the point that, it basically offset the decrease in the average funeral sale. So to recap what this means, our average per event, remained effectively unchanged when combined, but we had a significant increase in volume, which translates to our strong quarterly results.",
         "Now to the two questions that everyone has on their minds is this level of performance sustainable? And if not, what amount of this performance can be related to COVID? And my answer to that would be, it depends on the definition of performance. We can obviously operationally perform in this environment and we would expect to continue to execute at a high level.",
         "Bluntly, we expect good results from our businesses, and we work hard on making that happen. However, it's obvious that, the pandemic had an impact on our volume. So some of what you're seeing in these numbers is the direct result of that hard work on integration, as well as increasing our market share in many of our businesses, but some of it is based on the sheer at-need volume in our funeral homes and cemeteries, due to COVID or COVID-related deaths.",
         "So while I cannot quantify, how much of our exceptional performance was due to COVID, it's my personal opinion that we would have exceeded most expectations even in a COVID-free environment.",
         "In closing, these results exist only because of the hard work, dedication and commitment of our employees. You've heard this from me before, but we expect that from them. It's what they do, and they do it better than all others. We remain focused on keeping each of these people safe by quickly adapting to and adopting appropriate health and safety requirements, as the landscape continues to change. It is obvious that by necessities our employees cannot work from home. To the contrary, many of them have worked tirelessly and at times heroically on the front lines during this pandemic. I am extremely proud to be a part of this team and this operating company.",
         "I will now turn it over to the operator, and Joe and I will take your questions."

      "Jennifer Hay": [
         "Thank you, Cheryl. Good morning everybody. We would like to thank you for joining us today. Today's call is being recorded and a replay will be available after the call. Please be aware that certain information discussed today is forward-looking in nature. Any such information is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please see our public filings for more information regarding forward-looking statements.",
         "During the call, we will reference non-IFRS financial measures. Although, we believe these measures provide useful supplemental information about our financial performance they're not recognized measures and do not have standardized meanings under IFRS. Please see our public filings for additional information regarding our non-IFRS financial measures including for reconciliations to the nearest IFRS measures.",
         "I will now hand the call over to Park Lawn's CEO, Brad Green to open our discussion today."
      ],
      "Joe Leeder": [
         "Thanks, Brad and good morning everyone. First, you'll find a detailed breakdown of our second quarter operating results in our financial statements and MD&A which are available on our website and on SEDAR. My comments this morning will focus on the second quarter operating results. We are pleased to report that our total revenue for the three-month period ended June 30, 2020 was $84.7 million compared with $58.6 million in the same three-month period in 2019.",
         "This represents an increase of $26.1 million or 44.6% over the same period last year. And after adjusting for the impact of currency fluctuations, revenue growth from comparable business units in the second quarter was 7.3% over the second quarter of 2019, unadjusted for currency fluctuations that growth would have been 9.1%.",
         "The increase in revenue from comparable business operations during the quarter was the result of both our cemetery and our funeral businesses in the United States. The company's businesses located in markets such as New Jersey, Colorado and Michigan, experienced an overall increase in at-need services associated with COVID-19 cases. Our people in those markets made an exceptional personal effort to keep up with the demands brought on by the pandemic. They made personal sacrifices and we thank them for their commitment to service our families at their time of need.",
         "At the same time, our pre-need cemetery revenue was down in the quarter, as many regions faced the stay-at-home legislation that limited our ability to meet the families and close sales. However, we saw an improvement later in the quarter, as many jurisdictions relax the guidelines and our counselors were able to meet with families under restricted circumstances.",
         "In Canada, the company's cemetery business was not impacted to the same extent by the pandemic and we were able to maintain our pre-need sales activity during the quarter. Comparable funeral revenue in the U.S. market also increased during the quarter as a result of COVID-related services. Although, the number of services was higher, the effect of social distancing brought on by the pandemic resulted in a smaller memorial services which limited ancillary selling opportunities and negatively impacted the average revenue per call.",
         "In Canada, our funeral business was similarly impacted although the number of services did not offset the decline in average revenue per call and revenue was down approximately 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our gross profit increased by approximately $21.4 million in 2020 and our gross profit margin improved to 81% from 80.6% last year.",
         "With respect to expenses, the company's currency adjusted operating expenses including general and administrative, advertising and selling and maintenance expenses for comparable business units for June 2020 increased by approximately $3.9 million compared to last year. Our general and admin expenses for comparable business units increased by approximately $3.5 million.",
         "Our field level general and admin expenses accounted for $1.3 million of this increase over the second quarter of 2019 and the increase in expenses at the field level relates to significant increase in the number of cases in the quarter, as well as increased people to support the growth in certain businesses post acquisition, as well as aligning expenses, such as employee benefits and health insurance costs for employees in acquired businesses with the company's overall benefit plans.",
         "Advertising and selling costs increased also by approximately $400,000 as a result of higher revenue in the quarter. The balance of the quarter-over-quarter increase in general and admin expenses at the corporate level relates principally to expansion of our corporate infrastructure growth -- corporate infrastructure over the course of 2019 to support the company's growth. And you will see in our interest expense this quarter was higher as we utilized our credit facility to fund the acquisition of new businesses over the past year.",
         "With respect to our other income and expense items, on a net basis, we reported income for the quarter of $144,000, including the following items. We had an additional $240,000 in costs relating to the work of the special committee that were not captured at the end of Q1 of this year. We also had approximately $570,000 in restructuring costs in the quarter comprised primarily of severance-related expenses we incurred in early April in response to managing the pandemic risk.",
         "And finally, in Q1, I mentioned that we had qualified in March for a recovery of certain wage expenses in Canada under the CEWS program. During the quarter, we received approximately $1 million in wage subsidies which we recorded as other income. I should say that at this time we don't expect to qualify for any future payments under the extended CEWS program.",
         "Also in the United States, we participated in the CARES Act program established by the federal government, and to-date this has resulted in a deferral of certain payroll withholding taxes of approximately $1 million. These deferrals have no impact on our reported earnings as they are simply a cash deferral and will be repaid over two years commencing 2021.",
         "Our effective income tax rate in this quarter was 32.9%, which is higher than our statutory tax rates in both Canada and the U.S., which are approximately 26%. And the higher effective tax rate is the result of certain permanent timing -- permanent differences, such as non-deductible share-based compensation expenses and certain tax-free dividends that we received in Canada out of our trust funds. We would expect that there would continue to be a difference in effective tax rates as long as these permanent differences exist.",
         "So as a result of the above, I'm pleased to report that our quarterly earnings were up significantly over the same period in 2019. Our net earnings to PLC shareholders in the second quarter was $6.6 million, or $0.223 per share, compared to $1.6 million, or $0.049 per share last year. And our adjusted net earnings for our shareholders in the second quarter of this year was $8.8 million or $0.295 per share, compared with $5.7 million or $0.19 per share in the second quarter last year. This represents an increase of 55% in our adjusted earnings and our adjusted earnings per share.",
         "Similarly our adjusted EBITDA for our shareholders in the current quarter was $19.5 million, or $0.654 per share compared with $13 million or $0.438 per share last year. Again, this represents an increase in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share of 49% over the same period in 2019. That significant double-digit growth in per share earnings metrics from 2019 to 2020 reflects the impact of having all of our businesses included in our operating results for the full quarter and it reflects the fact that we have utilized the cash raised last year in our common share financing or using our credit facility to fund our growth. The combination of those factors has resulted in the significant year-over-year growth in per share earnings.",
         "So let me now say a few words about our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with borrowings of $215 million under our revolving credit facility. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter had increased to $34.3 million leaving us with net debt of $180.8 million. In addition to that debt, we had another $15.2 million in debt that includes notes payable to former business owners that we acquired. And these are held largely as security against non-compete agreements. We had a small mortgage loan and financing provided for -- to fund our insurance premiums, in the quarter. That totaled $15.2 million, altogether.",
         "And as you know we have two covenant tests associated with our revolving credit facility. These two tests are leverage ratio, which compares total debt to trailing pro forma adjusted EBITDA and this must be less than four times. And we have an interest coverage test which compares interest expense to the same adjusted pro forma EBITDA and must be greater than three times.",
         "We were in compliance with both of these tests at the end of the quarter, with our leverage ratio being 2.7 times -- 2.79 times and our interest coverage ratio 10.2 times. In late June, the market provided us with an opportunity to raise additional capital in the form of senior unsecured debentures. And in mid-July we closed a bought deal financing of $86.3 million, netting the company approximately $83 million.",
         "After using this cash to pay down our credit facility, we reduced our leverage ratio to 1.5 times and increased our liquidity to approximately $175 million. While we were comfortable with our financial position going into the pandemic, we believe this debenture financing provides us with the financial flexibility to support our operations through the uncertainties ahead. And also gives us the dry powder to take advantage of any acquisition opportunities that may come our way, in the coming months.",
         "Although, the senior unsecured debentures do not count towards our covenant calculations on our bank facility, we recognize that this is debt. However, the term of the debenture is 5.5 years. We have only a few small debt repayments in the foreseeable future. And so we are very comfortable with our ability to service our debt requirements.",
         "Turning to our various trust funds, market volatility in March put pressure on, the market value of our perpetual care and merchandise trust fund balances. Our perpetual care trust had unrealized losses of approximately $19.6 million, representing a 9.2% decline from book value, at March 31st. And our pre-need merchandise services trust funds also had unrealized losses of $2.9 million, representing a 1.4% decline from book value, at that date.",
         "At June 30th, the capital markets had improved substantially, such that our perpetual trust fund balances had a net unrealized gain of $2.4 million, representing a 1.1% gain from book value. And our pre-need merchandise and services trust funds, had an unrealized gain of $11.1 million or a 4.2% unrealized gain, over book value.",
         "I would also point out, that our pre-need merchandise and services book of business is supported by approximately $375 million of insurance contracts that have predetermined payout value. And this helps limit our exposure to market volatility, within those trusts. So as you know, we have a pipeline of future, revenue that currently sits on our balance sheet in the form of deferred revenue, amounts in our pre-need merchandise trust funds and our pre-need insurance contracts.",
         "And at June 30th, the backlog from this future revenue, currently sits at approximately $832 million, representing a significant source of future revenue for the company. And finally, you will recall, that back in March, as part of our COVID contingency planning we took precautionary steps to curtail some of our planned, expansion and maintenance capital expenditure programs, until we had a better visibility on the economic impact of this pandemic.",
         "Since then, we announced that we were moving forward with certain of those planned expenditures, including the visitation center, at Westminster Cemetery. So during the second quarter of 2020, we spent approximately $2.8 million, on growth-related capital expenditure projects, such as that, new on-site funeral home in Toronto, a new on-site funeral home in Houston, and a new sales office at Eternal Sunset cemetery, in New Jersey to support our pre-need sales programs, at that site.",
         "Also during the quarter, we spent an additional $1 million on expanding inventory at various cemetery properties, in the United States. And the cemetery expansion expenditures include amounts that would be spent on, mausoleum development and additional burial spaces, at those U.S. properties.",
         "Our maintenance capital expenditures at existing properties in the quarter were -- those expenditures totaled $1.6 million. And on an annual basis, our capital maintenance expenditures are planned to be at or below, our annual depreciation expense. And we're tracking to below that.",
         "I will now turn the call back to Brad, for some additional comments."

         "Remarks": [
            "So as I said through June, we saw an uptick in the pre-need cemetery sales and we've seen that continue, as we're going into this quarter. I think what you can point to on that is the fairly obvious triggering event of the pandemic. The hard part of selling pre-need cemetery sales is to get people to start talking about it and the fact that they need it. And since, we're facing the largest pandemic that's been \u2013 that anyone has ever seen in their lifetime, getting the conversation started on pre-need, gets a lot easier with a triggering event like this. So, we've seen it recover and I think it's going to continue to perform well, as long as we're dealing with a pandemic."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. So when you have places like New Jersey and Michigan at the beginning of the pandemic, and in the Northeast, I mean, we all saw it, because we're all watching the television those were hot spots and there was a significant increase in at-need business there. As that started to normalize, and it did we saw other markets starting to see an increase.",
            "Right now, it depends on what you're looking at across the company. But about half of our firms are showing an increase of about, I would say, larger than normal and about half or the same. And it's kind of following, where these COVID and COVID-related deaths are throughout the country. So it's still \u2013 we're still seeing at-need volumes responding to what's going on in COVID but it's not nearly what it was in the hot spot areas."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Brad Green"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Understood. And last quarter there was some pressure on revenue per call. It seems like that's continuing. Is there anything we can do to address that, or is that just a question of restrictions easing and just more folks showing up to funerals?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "George Doumet"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. So, we're -- George, we're laser-focused on that, right? Because that's something that will impact what we do and how we perform. And as best we can tell that is related to -- directly related to the stay-at-home orders in places where it's been locked down. I'm not saying it's jumping back up. But in places like the Northeast where we saw a significant drop, the moment those restrictions started to ease, you started to see an increase in those at-need averages.",
            "So you can't predict how this is going to ultimately impact the consumer, but people tend to get back to the norm. It's a very stable industry. And I would think that the size restrictions on the services, as they are continually relaxed, you're going to see a -- that at-need average return to normal. And we are -- like I said, we're laser-focused on that. So, we're going to do everything we can to make sure it pause-back as quick as we can."

And there were assurances made and we're backing those up. So you obviously go to those people. I've seen -- or we have seen an uptick from the brokers. They're bringing new businesses to us, and we're starting to get phone calls that we hadn't -- that were new businesses.",
            "The frequency of phone calls to people that want to join our company are probably a lot higher than you would think, and we say no a lot. But, there were no phone calls coming in during the pandemic Paul, and now those are starting again. So the answer is we're back on the acquisition trail with the ones that we were looking at pre-pandemic. And as new ones come in the door, we're looking at those as well."

When people are walking in to -- when they're -- when you have people that are coming into either our funeral home or a cemetery on an at-need basis, I mean they're obviously -- they're there, and it makes it a lot easier to talk about pre-need and you'll get pre-need sales out of that and that's what our people do. So, I agree with that assessment completely."

So they reported just under 2% cemetery revenue growth flat funeral home revenues on a 15%, call increase offset by 8% lower average ticket value. Is this a function of your better markets, both regional and micro market better services, better sales programs more wealthy clientele?"

      "33": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So yes, that's a tough question, right? But I would back up and say it this way. We're a lot smaller than SCI is. And I would not ever presume to say that we're doing something necessarily better than that management team is over there, because they're running a $7 billion company. So I can't really speak to what happens in their current environment or what happens in their company. We have a -- we're smaller. We're in more nimble markets I think. We have bluntly less things to worry about because we can -- we're more nimble and can pivot more quickly. So I really would just say that our results are different because we have a lot fewer businesses and I would say that the businesses that we do have are very strong. Most of them have come in through acquisitions. Most of them have been touched by this management team.",
            "So it's hard to compare in my mind actual performance to performance between the two companies. It's a lot easier to compare what we all see. And I think Paul mentioned it in his earlier questions. When he makes a comment that Tom Ryan is seeing this happen between cemetery and funeral homes, I think we can compare that because we see a lot of the similar things. But how the actual performance I can't compare one to the other. They're two drastically different businesses in my mind."

      },
      "35": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So I'll answer that this way. I think that there are owners that -- and I'm starting to see this and this was a challenge to operate a death care company in a pandemic. This executive team and management team, I think they would all tell you that it's probably the hardest and longest they've worked ever in their careers because of what we had to deal with and the speed at which it came at us. And we have a big support structure here to do that, because bluntly we all have each other. If you're that single funeral home owner or own a couple of them that puts you on an island. I mean, sure you have people that you can rely on, but I can only imagine the difficulty of going through that. And so we're seeing some people already that were going to be -- that saw that they were going to look for an exit strategy in three to five years start thinking about that now. So that's -- that would be my answer to what we're seeing is whether or not owners will come forward.",
            "As far as us having an advantage over SCI, we're going to constantly come into contact with them on large acquisitions. They're going to be successful on some and we're going to be successful on some. And I think that there are two different things that the owners can look at. And to dovetail back to your first question, we're different companies. We'll point that out and they'll have some owners that will want to join them and some owners that will want to join us. But we will have plenty of acquisitions to do as a company. The limitation will not be on good acquisitions to purchase. The limitation will be on in my mind the ability to operate them correctly because we're not going to grow, if we cannot operate them well. That's not what we do. And the second limitation would be access to capital and that doesn't appear to be a problem right now either. So I think we'll -- when we want to grow by acquisition, we'll grow by acquisition."

         "Remarks": [
            "So I would -- the operating expenses that you saw in the quarter were lower in some respect because going into this, we anticipated the worst and we prepared for it. So you saw us pull some of the expenses down and really get things tight. As the volume increased in areas or -- more than what we thought, we obviously had some areas that had actually an increase in operating expenses because of just the sheer volume that was coming through. We are integrating these companies as a result of doing the integration. You're going to see costs come down. I mean, hopefully -- I know we've mentioned that over the last three phone calls. And as we keep repeating things and they come to fruition, hopefully we'll continue to gain credibility with our investors. But we're seeing some of those costs come down because of what we said was going to happen. We put cost in Houston and we're integrating the businesses.",
            "I think we've learned a lot through this pandemic and so some of the cost savings that we have seen and some of the things that we cut, we might realize we don't need anymore or didn't need at the level that we needed it in the past. So I think you're going to see our costs continue to go down for two reasons. One we're still integrating like we said and that's been done very successful; and two we learned enough to keep -- that we're going to keep the cost down. But we're not going to cut it so much so that we stress our employees. And we saw that in some areas. I mean, there was fatigue in dealing with COVID and so we went in and quickly shored that up and that increased cost. So to summarize, yes, I think you'll see the costs remain either low or continue trending down."

We saw some people at the beginning close their doors. I mean, that's a very interesting approach to take.",
