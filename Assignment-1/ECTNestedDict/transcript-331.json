      "Bob Foley": [
         "Thanks, Greta, and good morning, everyone. A quick review of operating results. For the second quarter we generated GAAP net income of $42.9 million or $0.52 per diluted common share, net income available to TRTX common shareholders was $40.1 million, also $0.52 per common share and core earnings was $17.5 million or $0.23 per diluted common share.",
         "Our net interest margin was $44.2 million, up 2.1% from the prior quarter. We had no loans on non-accrual at June 30. We paid on July 14th, the $0.43 per share dividend relating to the first quarter of this year and we paid last week on July 24th, the $0.20 per share dividend declared on June 16th.",
         "Book value at quarter end was $16.55 per share, an increase of $0.49 per share, due primarily to the issuance of warrants in connection with the Series B Preferred Stock we issued on May 28th to a fund managed by Starwood Capital Group and GAAP earnings in excess of our $0.20 per share common dividend.",
         "Our second quarter results had seven -- several drivers. First, net interest margin, NIM grew quarter-over-quarter by 2.1%, due largely to the positive benefits of our in the money LIBOR floors on 100% of our loans, combined with non-zero LIBOR floors on only 5% of our liabilities, and that combination remains an important driver of our net interest margin. All of our assets and liabilities are floating rates.",
         "At quarter end, our weighted average LIBOR floor was 1.67%. In comparison, LIBOR at quarter end was 16 basis points. We continue to explore strategies to cost effectively preserve this positive margin against fluctuations in rates.",
         "Expenses were up 26% quarter-over-quarter, due primarily to non-recurring COVID-related expenses of approximately $2.9 million. We continue to manage tightly our controllable expenses but we recognize the need for professional services to help us manage the business.",
         "The base management fee was virtually unchanged from the first quarter. We paid no incentive management fee in the second quarter, nor did we in the first and we will not until we earn back over time the loss sustained in the first quarter.",
         "Loan loss expense was actually a benefit or income during the second quarter of $10.5 million, because the decline in our CECL reserve of $24.3 million net outstripped the loss on sale of $13.8 million incurred from the sale of that first mortgage loan that Greta described. In summary, the loans realized loss was materially less than its CECL related loss reserve that we booked at March 31.",
         "We held higher than normal cash balances during the quarter for defensive purposes, ending the quarter with roughly $300 million of available liquidity, including $173 million of cash on hand, net of cash we are required to hold for covenant compliance, $46.2 million of immediately available funds under our credit facilities and $81.3 million available for reinvestment from our second CLO FL2.",
         "It was a very busy quarter for us on the capital markets front, where we raise $225 million of preferred stock, deleveraged aggregate borrowings under our existing secured credit facilities by $157.7 million or roughly 7.7% of the outstandings.",
         "We extended maturities on three existing credit facilities, while simultaneously rightsizing the commitment amounts of two of those three facilities. We moved certain existing loans to our CLOs, and borrowed and repaid regularly with our repo lenders in the normal course of business.",
         "We issued $225 million of Series B 11% cumulative preferred stock and we hold an option to issue up to $100 million more before year end in two tranches of $50 million each. This capital buttresses our capital base during these uncertain times, with size to address our expected capital needs and aligns us with Starwood Capital Group, one of the strongest investors in the commercial real estate space.",
         "The voluntary deleveraging payments we made in late May, which totaled $157 million, reduced our average advance rate on repo borrowings to 68% from 76%, which implies a lender look-through LTV of a very modest 44%.",
         "In exchange for these payments, we will have a holiday for margin calls for certain defined periods and our work continues to increase from 51% share of total borrowings that are non-mark-to-market, non-recourse and equal or longer dated than our loan investments.",
         "We exercise existing extension options on our credit facilities with Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America to add at least 12 months of term to each arraignment -- arrangements, excuse me. Additional extensions are available to us.",
         "With Goldman and Bank of America, we reduce the financing commitments to avoid unnecessary fees, but we did retain options to increase each facility to $500 million at a future date. The weighted average final maturity of our secured credit facilities is now 2.3 years and these facilities represent 49% of our current borrowings.",
         "Non-recourse, non-mark-to-market borrowings represent 51% of our borrowings. Our two CLOs represent almost 48% of current borrowings have final rated maturities of 2034 and 2037, but their true maturity dates are tied to the repayment behavior of the underlying loans. Across both CLOs, the weighted average extended maturity of the loan so financed is about 4.3 years.",
         "During the quarter we borrowed a total of $23.5 million from four of our repo lenders in connection with the funding of $62.5 million of preexisting loan commitments to our borrowers. During the quarter we recycled $64.6 million of CLO reinvestment capacity, generating $22.6 million of cash for TRTX net of debt repayment on the loans contributed.",
         "That capacity was created by a partial principal payment of $15 million on one of our hotel loans, and the removal and refinancing outside of our CLOs of an existing loan. This recycling will remain available to us until the CLO reinvestment periods expire in the fourth quarter of 2020 for FL2 and the fourth quarter of 2021 for FL3, all subject to loan repayments that create the capacity I just mentioned.",
         "And finally, with respect to leverage, at quarter end, our debt-to-equity ratio was 2.8 to 1, which is consistent with our long-term historical trends and comfortably below our financial covenants.",
         "Regarding CECL, at June 30th, our CECL reserve was $58.7 million or $0.76 per share, a net reduction of $24.3 million over the prior quarter. The principal cause of the decline was the sale in early June of a $99.3 million first mortgage loan that created a realized loss of $13.8 million.",
         "The removal of that loan from our portfolio and its related CECL estimates of loan loss reserves resulted in a reduction in the CECL reserve of $24.8 million. The net impact of these offsetting factors, plus a net increase in the general CECL reserve of $0.5 million was to increase our net income by $10.5 million.",
         "Expressed in basis points against the total commitment amount of our portfolio, the CECL reserve was 104 basis points, as compared to 144 basis points at March 31st. On the same-store basis, our CECL reserve is slightly higher than the 101 basis points at March 31, which reflects our continuing caution regarding the COVID impacted economy and its impact on commercial real estate performance and values.",
         "We independently assess one of our 65 loans, which is a hotel loan that Greta described earlier, because it met the GAAP guidance for doing so. This collateral dependent loans contribution to the CECL reserve was less than $2 million and was estimated using discounted cash flow analysis.",
         "The macroeconomic assumptions embedded in our CECL analysis remained very conservative. We\u2019re three months deeper into this COVID crisis. Our analysis assumes we\u2019re no closer to a recovery.",
         "We do expect quarter-over-quarter changes and those reserve may continue to change materially in responses to COVID macroeconomic assumptions, observe transactions in the investment sales and loan sales markets and the actual operating performance of our loan collateral.",
         "Our weighted average risk rating measured on the amortized cost declined quarter-over-quarter to 3.1 from 3.2, reflecting the sale of one 5 rated loan, classification to 5 from 4 of the hotel portfolio loan Greta described and the upgrade to 2 from 3 of the multifamily loan based on performance that exceeds underwriting.",
         "We modified six loans during the second quarter to allow, among other things, borrowers to accrue 50% of interest due for up to six months. At June 30th, we accrued approximately 551,000 of payment-in-kind or PIK interest.",
         "Interest collections during the quarter were strong and we had no non-accrual loans at quarter end. Future performance will depend on many factors, especially the pace and the strength of the reopening of our national economy.",
         "And with that, we\u2019ll turn the floor, excuse me, we\u2019ll open the floor to questions. Operator?"

      "Deborah Ginsberg": [
         "Thank you. Good morning. And welcome to TPG Real Estate Finance Trust second quarter 2020 conference call. I\u2019m joined today by Greta Guggenheim, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Foley, Chief Financial Officer. Greta and Bob will share some comments about the quarter and then we\u2019ll open up the line for questions.",
         "Yesterday evening we filed our Form 10-Q and issued a press release with a presentation of our operating results, all of which are available on our website in the Investor Relations section.",
         "I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and outside of the company\u2019s control. Actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of some of the risks that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and 10-Q reports.",
         "We do not undertake any duty to update these statements and you should -- we will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures on this call, and for reconciliations you should refer to the press release and our Form 10-Q.",
         "With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Greta Guggenheim, Chief Executive Officer of TPG Real Estate Finance Trust."
      ],
      "Greta Guggenheim": [
         "Thank you, Deborah. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. While the equity and debt capital markets indicate we\u2019re in a recovery, we expect to continue to see significant volatility. The time it will take for us to meaningfully recover is unknown.",
         "With U.S. air travel at a relative standstill and office attendance very low, real estate NOI continues to have downward pressure. Although we believe the trough is behind us, we operate in an environment where there is no clarity regarding near-term economic conditions.",
         "Additionally, there are numerous factors that will continue to affect the slope of the recovery period; virus spread, vaccine, the election, relations with China to name just a few. In this environment, we are defensively focused.",
         "In particular, we are taking the following steps to best position our company. First, we have added to our senior management. I am delighted to announce that Matt Coleman joined us this week as President of the REIT.",
         "Matt\u2019s experience with TPG\u2019s Real Estate Equity Investing business, prior workout experience during the great recession, and his legal and operational background brings valuable experience and perspective to our business.",
         "Matt is very familiar with TRT, as he has been continuously involved with us starting with our inception in 2015 through the IPO in 2017 and to the present. We look forward to partnering with him.",
         "Second, we\u2019re focused on liquidity. A key driver of liquidity is the timing of loan repayments. During the first half of the year, repayments were $321 million. Repayments in the last two years prior to March generally occurred significantly earlier than we had anticipated or wanted, driven in large part by the then continued spread tightening and borrowers\u2019 ability to increase proceeds in a refinance.",
         "This phenomenon has stopped. Borrowers are not rushing to repay despite low LIBOR and treasury rates as they expect NOI will improve as COVID gets under control and the economy rebounds. Despite this, we are aware of several potential repayments in cases where borrowers are in the process of refinancing our loan or selling the underlying properties.",
         "Our primary use of cash is to fund future draws for CapEx, tenant improvement and leasing commissions, and interest reserves on our existing book. We have only $15 million of construction loan future fundings under our one construction loan, and the remainder of our deferred fundings totaled $420 million through December 2021. As a reminder, we received financing from our lenders to finance up to approximately 65% of these future funding draws.",
         "During the quarter, we decided to pay down our whole loan credit facilities by approximately $158 million or 8%. This reduced our advance rate on loans pledged to our bank lenders from 76% to 68%. Our objective was to reduce risk in the portfolio given the uncertainty of the timing of an economic recovery. Also, we continue to evaluate par sales of individual loans or interest in loans where we believe it makes sense.",
         "Third, we are zeroed in on asset management. Our senior and junior origination teams have joined with our asset managers to form a single team to manage our assets. Asset highlights include 63 of our 65 loans are current on interest payments. This represents 97% of interest payments.",
         "We are in the process of completing a loan modification that will bring this number of current loans to 64% in the -- \u2013 the number of current loans to 64% in the near-term. The one loan that will remain as not current is a loan on a portfolio of limited service hotels, and although the operations are certainly feeling the impact of COVID and shutdowns, it is in large part because of a dispute between the two owners that they have not come to the table with additional equity to effectuate a modification.",
         "The properties themselves are Marriott and Hilton branded limited service hotels, and six of the seven have been pipped [ph] in the last year. Current occupancy is in the 40% range, which is approximately breakeven NOI. The properties are in drive to locations and are not dependent on corporate group convention business. This acquisition loan was originated in 2019 with significant new equity invested.",
         "In the second quarter, we modified six loans with a $458 million unpaid principal balance. These modifications resulted in an accrual of $551,000 of interest in the second quarter. Other than the one hotel loan I referenced previously, our hotel sponsors have contributed substantial equity to support their properties. Most of the properties can support their operating costs from property cash flow.",
         "Office property rent collections are averaging about 90% in our diversified office portfolio. Multifamily rent collections by our borrowers have also been strong and averaged over 90%. 86% of the property securing our multifamily properties generally are in non-urban locations and/or our low rise properties. Collections are strong, but we\u2019ve seen a distinction between borrowers who have embraced virtual tours and other non-contact leasing strategies and those who have not.",
         "We executed a non-binding term sheet to provide acquisition financing for an office building in Brooklyn. This financing will repay an existing TRT loan, which was the subject of the deed in lieu request we disclosed last quarter.",
         "The acquirer of this asset and prospective borrower under a new loan is an existing borrower of TRT with whom we have a long successful track record. This is a very experienced office property owner operator in New York City, as well as other markets. The new loan required significant equity contributions from the borrower, including cash at closing and future guaranteed cash contributions. ",
         "Our core earnings for the quarter is $17.5 million or $0.23 a share, which reflects an $0.18 per share or $13.8 million loss on the sale of our $99.3 million loan on a Class A multifamily property in Downtown Houston. The primary purpose of this 50% loan to cost loan was to provide lease-up financing and additional improvements.",
         "Since origination, the property stabilized to a 94% occupancy. However, due to significant rate concessions in the market, retail space vacancy and this property\u2019s higher than underwritten OpEx relative to newly constructed properties, and in our view the low prospects for meaningful NOI growth, we decided to sell the loan.",
         "While COVID and the resulting economic impacts including lower oil prices have not helped the property, our decision to sell the loan was not motivated by COVID. This loan has been the subject of continued focus and we were able to negotiate a price which we felt maximized value to us. Bolstering earnings is our 167-basis-point LIBOR floor on loans, which is 150 basis points in the money, or asset WAC [ph] 5.06% versus our liabilities WAC of approximately 1.86%.",
         "To conclude, we are committed to maximizing the performance of our loan book, and continue to focus on maintaining and increasing liquidity in these uncertain times.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Bob."

First, Greta, if you could talk maybe a little bit about the six loan modifications, how that\u2019s -- those discussions go, what the give and takes are? I would assume the existing LIBOR floors will remain in those loans as is through the new duration. But could you maybe provide a little bit of color around that and how many more modifications from here? I know you mentioned one in process, but additional color on those conversations will be great?"

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Of the loans that we modified in the second quarter, which we mentioned there were six of them, four involved some element of deferral of interest, and in no case was the deferral of interest greater than 50% of the monthly debt service due, and in no case was the period that we allowed any deferral of interest greater than six months and in many cases it was significantly less.",
            "These were all hotel loans and two of the six have no deferral of interest. And they each require the sponsor making significant equity contributions to the property either upfront or on an ongoing basis to cover all the other costs and expenses associated with the hotel, plus, of course, the 50% -- up to 50% of deferral of interest.",
            "In the -- in one case, the borrower contributed equity, representing 13% of the loan amount, of which two-thirds of that went to pay down the loan and the rest of that went to fund and interest reserve. And in the -- and in other case, and in many cases, the flags of these hotels have allowed the borrowers to access FF&E reserves to cover operating costs and debt service and we allow that as well pursuant to these modifications.",
            "We are working on, as we mentioned, one modification and we have completed a couple of modifications. It\u2019s -- post the end of the second quarter, and these are generally for hotel properties which are having the most stress."

         "Remarks": [
            "Great. I appreciate the color on that, Greta. And I guess switching properties just from those hotel loan, you mentioned all hotel loans to office, your largest property type exposure. Can you give us any color just on discussions with borrowers, however, you would like to dissect it, whether it\u2019s gateway city versus non-gateway or maybe central business district versus more outside the downtown area, business office complexes. Can you talk maybe a little bit about what those borrowers are seeing, how those discussions are going and differences in demand and maybe how you expect performance to be inside that property type?"

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Well, it\u2019s -- the -- I guess, the cities, people are most concerned about the urban cores. And in New York City, we have two main office properties -- well, really three, one is classified as mixed-use, because there is a component of retail, but the primary use of that property is office.",
            "And of these three, for the purpose of this call, I\u2019ll refer to them as office. Of these three office properties, one is 100% leased to a very strong tenant for 15 years. The other is 100% leased and 50% of the tenancy or 47% to be precise is leased to one of the most successful online streaming movie company \u2026"

            "\u2026 for a long period of time, and it\u2019s doing quite well, that tenant. And then we have one that is a mixed-use property. We have really one mixed-use property in Manhattan that has more of a diverse tenancy. It happens to be institutionally-owned by one of the top three largest insurance companies and a very, very strong office focused, private equity operator of the property.",
            "So that\u2019s really our New York exposure. We don\u2019t really have downtown exposure in some of the other major cities that people are focused on like, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago. Our properties are pretty diverse. We have some properties in sort of Silicon Valley outside San Francisco that is -- one loan that is life science. We have one outside San Diego that\u2019s life science. But I would say that it\u2019s pretty diverse markets and not a tremendous amount of the cities that people are concerned about locations in at least the in the urban core. I don\u2019t know if that helped you."

And really with the borrower -- these as I mentioned, the office rent collections are in the 90% range, and our office borrowers have not really -- they haven\u2019t come to us like our hotel borrowers have asking for some type of you interest deferral or other types of modifications?"

So, CECL and the assumptions behind that, clearly, the reserve in March was a bigger number for the loan that was sold than what was realized on sale? Can you talk about those assumptions? Is it simply conservatism that something changed from March to May or March to the sale that makes a unique situation, or is there likely conservatism across all the assumptions in CECL? So maybe, and I know that\u2019s a very general broad question, but any color there would be great?"

      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Good morning, Stephen. Let\u2019s see if we can break that down into two topics and take the second one first. I would say that the results of the sale of the loan when compared to the CECL reserve, in our view largely reflects the team\u2019s ability to identify a buyer for that note that had a materially rosier view of Houston and of CBD Houston multifamily than we did. So in that regard, we found the outlier and executed with it.",
            "With respect to our views on the conservatism of our economic assumptions and everything else, all the other judgmental factors that are involved in the CECL reserve. We came out of the box in March on a conservative bent, if you had prepared a schedule and your research that lined up, reserves measured in basis points across the space and ours were near the high-end of the range, frankly. At this quarter end, net of the loan that was sold, it appears that our reserves are more in line relationship wise with our competitors.",
            "But we were conservative out of the box. You saw that we had -- we downgraded from higher levels to four all, but one of the hotel loans in our portfolio at March end and risk ratings were an important driver of a loss reserve estimates.",
            "So I think that quarter-over-quarter, we remain very conservative in our macroeconomic assumptions. But I think the market should evaluate our CECL reserve in the context of us having adopted a very conservative stance beginning in March."

Last question, I think a quick one, the loan that went from a four to five non-accrual.

You\u2019re sitting down maybe beyond just the hotel that you -- Greta you were describing how you met with your hotel borrowers and worked through modifications.

I am curious how you guys think about that given the difficulty, given just sort of the nature of the economic model of regaining that high watermark in the incentive, the ability to capture the incentive fee going forward. How do you think about that and I hate to reuse the word incentive, but from an incentive perspective, I do think it\u2019s a good sign and welcome that that TPG had -- is reiterating their commitment to the vehicle. But I do wonder the challenges with incentive fees being reduced probably for a very long time?"

            "For us to be in the money on the incentive fee or the manager to be in the money on the incentive fee and for the read to be obligated to pay it, several tests need to be met. One of them is that, cumulative core earnings needs to be positive as measured over the preceding 12 quarters.",
            "So the simple math there would be to take a look at what our cumulative core earnings were assuming that last quarter, the first quarter was T equals zero [ph] and then divide that by what you think our run rate core earnings are going forward. And it\u2019s not immediate, but it\u2019s close enough that I think that TPG and the employees of the manager can see it and they know that it\u2019s there and they know that by doing the work that the credit articulated earlier with some cooperation from the macro economy that we can get there.",

We are not the only permanent capital vehicle that the firm has sponsored. TSLX the business lender, the BDC type lender is a very important and a very successful platform as well.

I\u2019m assuming that those conversations have taken a different course.

Should there be a need for an extension of the modification beyond the agreed upon period, can we see further loan modifications at that point or is it likely that those loans would be pretty soon send for the default process. I\u2019m just kind of curious to what your thoughts are kind of beyond the agreed upon period ideally, the longer and better shape then, but just wondering what that might look like?"
