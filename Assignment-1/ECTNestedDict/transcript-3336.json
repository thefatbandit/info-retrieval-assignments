         "Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. We want to spend a few minutes talking to you about our announcement this morning, the acquisition of Vertafore. Briefly, Vertafore is a leading provider of SaaS solutions targeted to the United States property and casualty insurance market.",
         "We\u2019re buying the business for $5.35 billion from Bain Capital and Vista Equity. We expect the deal to close later this quarter and be immediately cash accretive. For calendar 2021, Vertafore will have approximately $590 million of revenue and $290 million of EBITDA. We\u2019ll finance this transaction with a combination of cash on hand, the use of our revolving credit facility and a new bond issuance.",
         "To this end, we remain steadfastly committed to maintaining our solid investment-grade ratings and have fully previewed this transaction with both Moody\u2019s and S&P. Once closed, Vertafore\u2019s results will be reported in our Application Software segment.",
         "Not surprisingly, Vertafore meets all of our acquisition criteria. To name a few, the business has a tremendous margin profile and cash flow characteristics. As usual for us, the business is very asset-light and has negative working capital. This is really just an amazing business model.",
         "The management team is excellent, importantly, one that is deeply committed to executing Vertafore strategy and continuing to build the business for the long-term. We\u2019ve enjoyed getting to know Amy and her leadership team during the diligence process and look forward to welcoming them to the Roper family.",
         "Relative to their market, Vertafore is a clear leader in their niche, which is software for the property and casualty insurance industry in the U.S. And as such, the business has tremendous levels of very deep domain knowledge and they are super intimate with their customers.",
         "And finally, and relative to growth, this business has very high levels of recurring revenue, a touch north of 90% and multiple, multiple growth drivers. We like this business for many reasons, but the durability of their growth and the diversification of their growth drivers are towards the top of our list. So this is just another perfect fit relative to our capital deployment and corporate strategy.",
         "Let\u2019s go ahead and turn to the next page and discuss what Vertafore does. Vertafore is a business that delivers cloud-based software to the property and casualty insurance industry, principally in the United States. Vertafore\u2019s focus is straightforward to simplify, automate, and drive productivity across the complex and highly regulated processes in the P&C space.",
         "Today, the business serves over 20,000 independent P&C agencies, 1,000 insurance carriers and touches over $140 billion of premiums per year. For simplicity, this business can be broken into three components: agency products, carrier products and benchmarking and analytical solutions. Specific to the agency products, Vertafore enables the business processes for the independent P&C agent, by far the largest distribution engine for these insurance products.",
         "Vertafore provides the core agency management software solution. They are the system of record, if you will, for these agencies. These products are the solutions that agencies run their business on from customer acquisition and management to policy applications and renewals to their core financial and accounting functions.",
         "In addition to the core AMS, Vertafore provides several best-of-breed point solutions for the Independent agencies, such as tools that enable the clients, the digital client experience for their agents, how the agents interact with their customers digitally, to solutions that enable more efficient and automated connectivity with their carriers and products that help manage the agent\u2019s health benefits book of business.",
         "On the other side are their carrier solutions, solutions that are all best-of-breed point solutions. A couple of examples here include the tools needed to ensure a producer or agent compliance. As you likely know, this industry is highly regulated at the state level and all agents have to be credentialed and one of Vertafore\u2019s products is used by carriers in over 20 states to manage producer compliance and certification.",
         "Another example is the automation of compensation and commission management into the distribution channel. Essentially, the automation of the way carriers pay agents and the recruitment and onboarding of those agents.",
         "And finally, what sits at the intersection of both product groups is a tremendous amount of data, so Vertafore creates benchmarks and analytics sold back to both the carriers and the agencies, so they can better understand and analyze their book of business.",
         "With that, let\u2019s turn to our final slide. So when we look at this business, we\u2019re attracted by many things. First, they\u2019re a clear leader in a very niche end market. This market, the P&C insurance market is super resilient. In addition to being resilient, this industry is marked by having high levels of complexity and regulation, all things that serve as meaningful barriers to entry and provide tremendous incumbent advantage.",
         "Next what Vertafore does is mission-critical for the agencies. Their agency customers cannot run their business without Vertafore. In addition, Vertafore\u2019s point solutions for both the agencies and carriers provide tremendous incremental value.",
         "Importantly, this business has a very long track record of solid mid single-digit organic growth. We love the durability of this growth engine as discussed. There are many growth drivers here from new logos, to new products, to cross-selling, to up-selling, to modest price increases across two different customer segments, the agents and the carriers.",
         "This business has 90-plus percent recurring revenue and very strong margins. And though we diligence their customer base, we are impressed with the diversity of the customer base, as well as their loyalty and commitment to Vertafore.",
         "And finally, the team is super strong here. They have a tremendous track record over the last four or five years of Vertafore and are excited about having a permanent home for the business, a home that is laser-focused on long-term, durable organic growth, a home where Vertafore\u2019s customers can rest assured we will continue to invest for the long-term. It\u2019s for these reasons, we\u2019re excited about this capital deployment opportunity.",
         "And with that, let\u2019s turn it over to your questions."

         "Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. All participants will be in listen only mode. [Operator Instructions]",

Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President, controller; and Shannon O\u2019Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.",
         "Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our definitive agreement to acquire Vertafore. The press release also includes replay information for today\u2019s call. We prepared a short presentation to accompany today\u2019s call, which is available through the webcast and is also available on our website.",

During the course of today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today\u2019s call in the context of that information.",
         "And now, if you\u2019ll please turn to Slide 3, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Neil. After his prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take questions from our telephone participants. Neil."

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Yes, sir. So what I\u2019d love to start with is that this is an adjacency to iPipeline, which is life insurance. So you guys have done some adjacent purchases like with TransCore, as I recall. But just the dynamics of having two different businesses within insurance, it sounds like you\u2019ll still run them independently. But are there any synergies between the two? And do the regulators see these as completely separate markets?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Deane Dray"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So they are very distinct separate markets. The distribution \u2013 the carriers are, for the most part, different. I think, there\u2019s a handful of carriers that write both property and casualty and life. But for the most part, the insurance writers, if you will, are different. The distribution channels are different. The channel economics are different. Life insurance, you sell once. P&C, you have to sell virtually every year.",
            "So this is \u2013 the industry dynamics are very different. We just to confirm for everybody, well, we will run Vertafore and iPipeline as independent businesses. There\u2019s no plans at all to integrate them in anyway in the short-term or long run.",
            "That said, there certainly probably are some best practices that can be shared across. What is relatively mature in the life insurance space is the automated connectivity between the agencies and the carriers. That\u2019s less mature in the P&C space. And so there\u2019s certainly some best practices that can likely be shared there, but these are fundamentally different end markets.",
            "And then it\u2019s important to note also, Deane, and it\u2019s a subtlety, iPipeline is in our network segment for the reasons that we talked about when we did that deal, the vast majority of that business is about connecting all the parties in the life insurance space, if you will. Vertafore is going to be in our Applications segment, because the core of what Vertafore does is sell this ERP-like solution for the agencies."

         "Speaker": "Neil Hunn"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "All right. That distinction is really helpful. Thanks for that color. And then the follow-up question is, look, this is one of the larger deals that Roper has done and the largest you\u2019ve done, Neil. What are the considerations about the pipeline, no pun intended today? Have you used up your \u2013 all your dry powder? Can you do both on deals in the interim? And might you consider equity, too, as partial funding for this deal?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Deane Dray"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "All right. So we\u2019ll try to hit all of those. So for funding for this deal, no. There\u2019s not going to be use of equity in any shape, way, shape or form. We\u2019re very confident in our funding sources, as we talked about cash revolver and some new bonds and we discussed that process and strategy with the rating agencies.",
            "Relative to the pipeline, this is sort of like back to the future a little bit with Deltek. When we did Deltek, we told investors and the rating agencies and our bond investors that we delever over the course of 12 to 18 months, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do here. There are a few small number of little bolt-ons sort of in that deleveraging period after Deltek. That could be the case here, but we\u2019re committed to deleveraging here over the next bit of time."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hi, good morning, and congratulations. Maybe just my first question around the figures you laid out on Page 3 on the sales and EBITDA. So the margins look very, very high at Vertafore, 49%, 50% or so. Just wondered if you could explain how the margins have trended in recent years in the business, and whether those numbers you lay out for 2021 include anything in the way of sales or cost synergies?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Julian Mitchell"
      },
      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "There\u2019s no \u2013 yes, there\u2019s sales or cost synergies at all in the model, because there\u2019s nothing that we can integrate it into that would drive either one of those lines. To your first question, the \u2013 we\u2019re buying this business from Bain and Vista. Their thesis for 4.5 years ago was to structurally work to improve the margins in this business.",
            "And in the management team here, Amy, did a great job in doing that. And we spent a lot of time in our diligence making sure that this was a durable margin structure. They sort of centralized and standardized. They went from 14 to seven offices. They went from four ERPs to one. They went from three sales force implementations to one. They did a nice job sort of investing go-to-market, investing in the products over this period of time. They added a customer for life organization.",
            "So they are able to sort of take costs out that were truly redundant and then invest where they needed to invest to drive growth and Net Promoter Score gains, if you will. And it\u2019s also \u2013 it\u2019s worth noting that sort of these are the industry \u2013 the margins now is what we understand to be the industry margins, right? So it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not an outlier in that regard."

         "Speaker": "Neil Hunn"
      },
      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, right. It\u2019s a very high gross margin business. And so therefore, you have 30, 35 points of investment. it\u2019s still running EBITDA margins in the high-40s. So it\u2019s a very healthy business and we\u2019ll continue to invest and we\u2019ll continue to invest to accelerate organic growth moving forward."

         "Remarks": [
            "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then maybe if you could just give me some context as to the addressable market that the size of that for Vertafore. I think you mentioned, Neil, it\u2019s a clear market leader in the niche. So any indications of the approximate market share and who its main competitors might be?"

         "Speaker": "Julian Mitchell"
      },
      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. So in aggregate, the market size, if you will, about three $3.5 billion, that\u2019s sort of annual recurring revenue to measure on that market size. It\u2019s split about 40%, 45% or so on the agency side and the balance on the carrier side.",
            "The principal competitor on the agency side is a company called Applied Systems. It\u2019s owned by a sponsor. And then the competitors on the carrier side are really small, niche, best-of-breed or sort of niche competitors. There\u2019s not a single large one in any of the sort of sub-verticals in which Vertafore competes."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hey, Neil, just maybe just give us a little bit more on the history here. So, this is a company that\u2019s kind of traded hands now a couple of times over the past decade. Is this something that you guys have looked at in the past? Like how did this deal come to fruition? How much diligence did you guys do on it?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I appreciate and happy to answer that question. So we first look at this business in the first part of 2016 in the process that was run when Bain and Vista bought it. We liked a lot about the business, then the characteristics of the business, the niche, the market, the durability of the market, the growth drivers, all sort of the business fundamental things.",
            "At that point in time, it was a management team that, that we couldn\u2019t get particularly excited about. And so we backed away, as we often do. That\u2019s \u2013 this \u2013 the management team sort of thriving inside of our culture is outside of cash return threshold is the number one reason we walk away from a transaction, it\u2019s not unusual.",
            "So we stayed close to the business. And then beginning, it was the first quarter of last year, we went to Denver and spent time with Amy and her team to sort of get reacquainted with the business and understand sort of how they evolved, and essentially stayed close to the team over the course last 18 months.",
            "So yes, it\u2019s been an extended getting to know this company process. And then over the last six or so weeks, maybe seven or eight weeks in the market diligence and then the diligence with the company itself, things accelerated as they do in these processes."

It sounds like you guys are pretty enthusiastic about its prospects. I\u2019d just be curious if you could maybe just give us a little bit more on the history.",
            "So you mentioned that, that the private equity partners are really focused on expanding margins. How did this company grow over the past one to three years? And if you\u2019re thinking about kind of like the growth trajectory, what\u2019s the area do you think you\u2019re most excited about?"

The sponsors here, their goal was to \u2013 their investment thesis was certainly to improve the margins, but do it \u2013 basically drive a better operationally and efficient organization, right?",
            "I mean, so they did it the right way. I just want to underscore that. This wasn\u2019t sort of financial engineering and laying off a bunch of people. That\u2019s not what this exercise was. So we feel we\u2019ve got a much more operationally efficiently run business than what we looked at in 2016.",

It\u2019s been consistent mid single-digit organic growth business really for the past decade, and that\u2019s what we see moving forward that are, obviously, we\u2019ll work to do better than that, but very, very consistent, very resilient, holding up very well this year, right in the COVID environment, like many of our software businesses.
