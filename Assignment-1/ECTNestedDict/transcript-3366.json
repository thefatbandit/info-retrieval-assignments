      "Lainie Goldstein": [
         "Thanks, Karl and good afternoon everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.",
         "As Strauss mentioned, fiscal 2021 is off to a great start with our first quarter operating results significantly beating our expectations. Net bookings grew 136% to $996 million, which was a fiscal first quarter record. This result exceeded our outlook of $800 million to $850 million, driven by the exceptional performance throughout our portfolio led by NBA 2K20, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Social Point's mobile games, partially offset by the underperformance of Disintegration.",
         "Digitally delivered net bookings grew 139% as compared to our outlook of 100% growth and accounted for 92% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. During the first quarter, 77% of sales of current generation console games were delivered digitally, up from 75% last year. Recurrent consumer spending grew 127% as compared to our outlook of 75% growth and accounted for 65% of total net bookings. This growth was driven primarily by NBA 2K20, Grand Theft Auto Online, and Social Point's mobile games.",
         "GAAP net revenue grew 54% to $831 million, which is the fiscal first quarter record and cost of goods sold increased to $477 million. Operating expenses increased by 10% to $272 million due primarily to our COVID-19 charitable initiative, head count expansion and higher incentive compensation as a result of the Company's performance. And GAAP net income grew to $89 million or $0.77 per share as compared to $46 million or $0.41 per share in the first quarter last year.",
         "Now to our guidance, starting with the fiscal second quarter. We project net bookings to range from $775 million to $825 million compared to $951 million in the second quarter last year, which benefited from the launch of Borderlands 3. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Borderlands 3, Social Point's mobile games, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and The Outer Worlds. We expect digitally delivered net bookings to be flat, driven by growth in recurrent consumer spending, offset by lower digitally delivered sales of Borderlands 3 which launched last year. Our forecast assumes that 63% [ph] of our current generation console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 51% last year. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 10%. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $750 million to $800 million and cost of goods sold to range from $355 million to $381 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $285 million to $295 million. At the midpoint, this represents 8% decrease over last year, driven primarily by lower marketing expense. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $98 million to $110 million or $0.85 to $0.95 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2021.",
         "Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. We are increasing our net bookings outlook range to $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion from $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion, driven by our outperformance in the first quarter along with an updated forecast for the balance of the year. We are continuing to see elevated engagement and sales from people sheltering at home, which we have included in the second quarter, but have not yet factored into the back half of the year. We expect growth in NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Social Point's mobile games to be offset by lower results in Borderlands 3, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V. Red Dead Online, excluding digital content bundled with the premium edition is projected to be approximately flat versus fiscal 2020.",
         "The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Borderlands 3, Social Point's mobile games, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and The Outer Worlds. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and Social Point. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.",
         "We now project digitally delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 3% as compared to our prior outlook of an 8% decline. This growth is being driven by recurrent consumer spending and digitally delivered sales. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87%, up from 82% last year.",
         "Our forecast assumes that 68% of current generation console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by 15% [ph] as compared to our prior outlook of flat versus fiscal 2020 and represent to 61% of net bookings as compared to 51% last year. This growth is being driven by NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Social Point. We are increasing our non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow outlook to more than $500 million, up from our prior outlook of more than $350 million. We plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion. At the midpoint this represents a 3% increase over the prior year, driven by higher headcount, R&D expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing and stock compensation expenses. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $350 million to $380 million or $3.05 to $3.30 per share.",
         "In closing, fiscal 2021 is off to a strong start and is poised to be another terrific year for our organization. We remain well positioned both to navigate the uncertainties of these times and to capitalize on the positive trends within our industry. Over the long term our industry-leading creative assets, firm commitment to operational excellence and strong financial foundation position our Company to deliver significant growth and margin expansion for our shareholders.",

         "Turning to our business. Fiscal 2021 is off to a terrific start with first quarter operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations, including fiscal first quarter records for GAAP net revenue and net bookings. Our outstanding results were driven by the outperformance of NBA 2K20, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, and Social Point's mobile games. I remain incredibly proud of our entire organization which exemplifies our core tenets of creativity, innovation and efficiency and continues to deliver industry-leading entertainment experiences to our audiences during these challenging times.",
         "In the first quarter NBA 2K20 significantly outperformed expectations and recently achieved the franchise milestone of $1 billion in net bookings since launch. Consumer engagement with NBA 2K continues to increase with daily active users growing 82%, MyCAREER users growing 78% and MyTEAM users up a remarkable 108% as compared to the first quarter of last year. Recurrent consumer spending in NBA 2K grew 126% to a new record and remained as the largest contributor to that part of our business. To date, NBA 2K20 has sold in over 14 million units, up over 18% compared with NBA 2K19 in the same time frame.

In addition, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our forecast growing 155% to a new record.",
         "In April, Rockstar Games released Gerald's Last Play, a series of six new Contact Missions for Grand Theft Auto Online. The first quarter was the second best period ever for a new player acquisition since the title launch in 2013. The unprecedented player volume trends that started with the superlative performance of the Diamond Casino & Resort update in July, 2019 and drove record average multiplayer MAUs through August 2019 persisted with sequential records in average multiplayer MAUs from December 2019 through May 2020. We now expect Grand Theft Auto Online to establish a new net bookings record in fiscal 2021.",
         "In addition, the partnership with Epic Games Store were Grand Theft Auto V was offered free for a week in mid-May was a contributing factor to the strong performance of Grand Theft Auto Online and did not come at the expense of paid sales of the title. In fact Grand Theft Auto V sold through more units in the period than any first quarter since the title launch in 2013. And in the six weeks following the Epic Store promotion, Grand Theft Auto V sold more units than in the same period in any previous year.",
         "Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed and to date has sold in more than 32 million units worldwide. The title sold through twice as many units compared to last year.

During the first quarter 2K and Gearbox launched Bounty of Blood, the third of four announced paid campaigns that are included in the Borderlands 3 Super Deluxe Edition and the Season Pass or are available for purchase separately upon release. The Season Pass attach rate for Borderlands 3 continues to be the highest in 2K's history and there is more content coming. In the period MAUs grew as sales continued at a steady pace with the consistent release of free and paid content. We attribute this ongoing success in part to 2K's and Gearbox Software's continued efforts to support Borderlands 3 as a live service game, which should continue to benefit the title and series over the long term.",
         "Private Division's critical and commercial success The Outer Worlds outperformed expectations in the first quarter and is now sold in 2.8 million units. On June 5th the title was released for Nintendo Switch.

And was that decision broadbased or title specific spans [ph] NBA 2K21 will span two NBA seasons this time instead of one?

And of course GTA V was created for the last console generation. It's the standard-bearer in this generation. And now we've announced that it will be available for the next generation of consoles which is just amazing. Historically Rock Star always delivers a great new experience with new content and new opportunities to excite, engage and surprise players. That's true of everything that Rockstar Games releases.

So our question was around this. Strauss when you mentioned -- I think you said The Outer Worlds and the Switch was 2.8 million units already. How do you see Private Division aggregating up volumes over time? Lainie, I think you said near term it's going to hit 10%, that's Private Division and Social Point. So how should we think about that metering out, going to be longer down the road, going to be a bigger percentage?",

Can you give us any color or dynamics in terms of how types of players are engaging with private label versus some of your other studios?"

So -- and we're very excited about it. Outer Worlds also has more content coming and that's a very exciting opportunity. We think the opportunity for Private Division to be a greater percentage of our overall net bookings is strong and to state the obvious, it will all depend on the quality of the releases. But they [ph] continue to sign up and announce great publishing arrangements with first class independent developers and so far their track record is pretty extraordinary which is amazing.",
            "In terms of the demographic to which they appeal, I think that's title by title. I don't think there's anything in particular in their strategy that would either limit or expand the scope of their potential audience except that their titles are created by developers who live outside of the big company system. And does that give them an opportunity to be perhaps more innovative and take more risk, possibly, although we pride ourselves on being the most innovative company across everything we do. So it's a -- it's a really good start. We're incredibly proud of what the team has achieved so far at Private Division and very optimistic about the future."

And then a bigger picture question on digital distribution. Strauss, I know you guys support platforms where your users are where they were they want to access games. There are an increasing number of platforms, which seems to add some complexity to the industry. And I'm curious if you have any updated thoughts on a direct-to-consumer offering, if you think that makes more sense now or maybe less sense, but just curious on your thoughts on distribution.

We were original projecting that it wasn't going to be a record year. And now it's going to be a record year across the board. We obviously have some tailwind with that behind the shelter-at-home. But generally speaking the game has been improving since the day it came out and it's really generated a huge amount of interest across the Board. In terms of has that interest changed with the new seasons etc. There's really nothing to report there at this point. It is -- certainly we're excited that basketball is back at it. It's always a good thing when people are engaged with the NBA. It's an incredible brand and having players on the court is obviously a good thing for us.

We need to find that intersection of what's great for the consumer and what makes sense for us as a producer and distributor. And there are a lot of opportunities. We tend to be very supportive of new launches. We were supportive early of Google Stadia. We certainly support what Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo do when they bring out new platforms and I think that will continue. In terms of direct to consumer opportunities, naturally we have the ability to go direct to consumer. Rockstar goes direct to consumer through their Launcher. 2K goes direct to consumer. We have the ability for consumers to buy goods directly from our Company and I expect that to continue. It's still a relatively small portion of our business. And I think our expectation over time is that our goal is not to drive consumers to any particular destination including one of our own. Our goal is to be where the consumer is."

Some of these titles are early on in development, some of those titles are much further along in development. Some of these titles are very, very big titles and some of these titles are very, very, very small titles. And so there is a big -- there is a big mix there. And in terms of -- so you can't really say whether it's just more titles are they are less expensive because there is such a play between those two elements. But you identified those elements.

In terms of the lasting impact of this period of time, it's so hard to predict because most humans tend to believe that whatever is going on right now is what will always continue and of course that's not the case. Everything in fact generally changes. So we've seen certain companies announce that from their point of view, everyone should just always work from home. And I know there are people -- I know who believe they'll never go to the movies again or they'll never fly in an airplane again or stay in a hotel again or eat inside in a restaurant again. I don't see the world that way.",
            "So from our point of view this tragedy will pass and the world will go back to looking an awful lot like it did before. However, it does feel like this has been a period of time where previously existing trends have been accelerated. And I do think that we appreciate the possibility of remote work as needed where we understand in a disaster scenario how we can continue to be productive. I think, frankly, it's created a great benefit in our morale as an organization. As any tragedy does, I think tragedy will either pull people together, push them apart. I think we had a strong enough culture that it pulled people even more together. It's just my point of view. But I think it's borne out in the level of productivity, in the quality of our games and the quality of our operations. I'm hopeful that that continues.",
            "In terms of the consumer, I do think that this has intensified a shift from old analog entertainment to new interactive entertainment. And I do think that people have come back to video games and tried video games when they hadn't tried them previously. And I think you're going to see a long-lasting increase in demand. Again, that's not reflected in our numbers because we don't build our guidance based on my opinion about things, luckily. But I do believe that's the case and I think you're seeing a systemic shift in favor of interactive entertainment. And there are only a handful of companies on earth who aim to do what we do, never mind are able to do what we do. So, it puts us in a very good position indeed.",

I'd just be curious, the response you've gotten from your player community on The Naturalist experience, latest upgrade or update for Red Dead Online and also curious about future cadence of content. I think it was December last year when we got the Moonshiners update. So, it seemed like it was sort of an extended period of time before we got an update. I'm just curious if that was maybe because of work from home or if there is something else going on that sort of led to that sort of lengthy time in between updates.",

Obviously a lot of people without jobs, how you think about how it could impact the recurrent spend within the game and if you've done any sort of survey work or what gives you, I guess, the confidence that demand won't slip with that price point?

And as you know, Rockstar Games decides on the cadence of updates and it's driven by great ideas and the ability to deliver those great ideas into superb experiences. And all of our labels wait to distribute new content until it's nearly -- it's as perfect as it can possibly be. There is more content coming for both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online this fiscal year. So stay tuned. I think it's going to be awesome. In terms of the price point, this is a very modest price increase. The pricing has been going down on a real dollar basis for the better part of 15 years. And we're applying this price point in the case where we think the quality not only supports it, but demands it. Our production costs have gone up greatly. But most importantly, the consumer experience is more robust than ever before. And I am utterly convinced that NBA 2K '21 will be nothing short of extraordinary.

And just at a higher level without the specifics, what sorts of factors go into the decision to make such a partnership with a company like Sony?

It's like something that would probably not have happened but were not for the COVID situation. So in a lot of ways there are some interesting things that come out of these situations when you're dealt with them. This particular one, I wouldn't really think about it as a specific moneymaking opportunity in the moment. But like any marketing or anything that engages an audience or even creates new audience, it has the benefit of creating interest and engagement with the game. So we really look at that kind of thing, like we would as any other marketing opportunity.",

So that's not to say we can do it every day or that this is something that is going to set some kind of precedent for us, but it certainly is interesting, it was a lot of fun to do and it undoubtedly increased interest and engagement with the game.

And that's really a reflection of NBA 2K morphing from being the highest quality sim in the market to one of the highest quality interactive entertainment experiences of any kind. And it's both a sim and the lifestyle and a world you can inhabit that's constantly evolving and changing. That's very much the goal of visual concepts and you're seeing that goal being realized. And I believe you will see it'd be more and more realized. Does the League form a part of that, unquestionably. We also expect it to be very successful on a standalone basis."

Karl, a follow up to previous question, but the upcoming game pipeline for 93 new titles that you mentioned last quarter that will launch by, I think, it was fiscal '25. Should we expect a similar cadence as we've seen in the past of maybe one non-sports AAA title per year? And I think that the 11 franchises in your portfolio now that have sold in at least 5 million units. Is it also fair to assume that the content play will include people from most of bigger franchise? Thanks."

So whether that number is one to three, that certainly would be the goal."

So the 100% plus growth in MyTEAM players, certainly consistent with demand we're seeing for expression personalization in games right now. But does this speak to the opportunity for a non-sim game from the NFL and why 2021 is the right time in place to deliver that game? And then on a related matter, the doubling of the NBA players I think it was last quarter. Can you speak to how much you've seen a growth in players brand new to the franchise so that as you look forward even if you lost some of these kind of French casual guys you will still be net ahead? Thanks."

And we'll leave to visual concepts how that will be expressed going forward. But right now we think NBA 2K offers something for everyone. You want the best sim game, it's there; you want an opportunity to experience great music, it's there; great characters, it's there; play outside of the sim game, it's there; or just experience the world, that's a possibility too. So I'm sure there'll be much more to talk about. We'll let visual concepts and 2K talk about it. In terms of data around players, we don't tend to get -- to go into that much detail. But with 14 million units sold, 18% greater than last year, wonderful engagement and enormous growth in recurrent consumer spending. I think you can safely assume that the audience is expanding."

Otherwise we wouldn't have done that partnership and won't be so excited about it. The fact -- the success of MyTEAM isn't necessarily a barometer for that. There are so many different kinds of non-simulation play. Whether the MyTEAM phenomenon is relevant or not, remains to be seen. But irrespective of that the non-sim market is very exciting for us and that's why we're going forward with NFL with that."
