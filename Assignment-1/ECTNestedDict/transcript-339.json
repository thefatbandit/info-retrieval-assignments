         "Thank you, Pedro. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us today. I\u2019d like to join Pedro in acknowledging our Copa team. Today, under very difficult circumstances, they are showing their great spirit. For the second quarter, we reported a net loss of $386 million or a $9.08 per share. As Pedro mentioned, our results include several noncash special charges.",
         "So let me begin by first [Audio Dip] during the quarter, we made the decision to pace the Boeing 737-700 fleet for sale. And given the reduced capacity plans, determined that we would likely not operate those aircraft again. That decision triggered a $186.8 million noncash and nonrecurring charge, and the assets are now classified as held-for-sale on the balance sheet.",
         "During the quarter, we also negotiated the sale of all of our remaining 14 Embraer-190 aircraft, 6 spare engines and spare parts inventory. This transaction was concluded last week. You might remember those assets were already booked as held-for-sale since our fourth quarter 2019 results. Even though the agreed sale price was lower than our original estimates, which resulted in a $50 million noncash and nonrecurring loss, given the current market conditions, we believe this was a good deal for us. We also recorded a noncash $22.2 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on the implicit derivative instrument related to the cash settlement option of the senior convertible notes issued in April 2020.",
         "And finally, a $12.3 million noncash reversal of unredeemed ticket revenue provisions booked during the first quarter of 2020, given the uncertainty in future passenger behavior related to the COVID-19 crisis. Excluding these special items, our underlying net loss for the second quarter came at $114.6 million or a loss of $2.70 per share. Our cash burn for the second quarter came in at $232 million, an average of $77 million per month, which is lower than our prior estimates, as we mainly focused on reducing our fixed expenses and had a lower number of cash ticket refunds than forecasted. This figure only excludes proceeds and payments from extraordinary financing activities.",
         "In terms of capacity for the remainder of the year, our operating plan for the month of September represents less than 10% of 2019 capacity for the month and could build up to a range of 30% to 40% of 2019 ASM levels by December. Assuming this gradual restart of operations, we should be able to further reduce our average monthly cash outflow to around $66 million for the second half of 2020. This figure assumes that our leased aircraft and debt commitments are paid in full and that we stay current in all of our obligations. The improvement in our cash burn estimate for the remainder of the year is a function of our sharp focus in the reduction of our cost base as well as a gradual restart of our operations.",
         "I\u2019m going to spend some time now discussing our balance sheet and liquidity. As of the end of the second quarter, assets totaled $4.1 billion, owners equity was almost $1.7 billion. Our debt plus our lease liabilities totaled $1.6 billion. Our lease liability adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio came in at 0.9x, and our debt-to-equity ratio ended the quarter at 1.1x. We closed the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in debt, more than 78% of which is fixed with a blended rate, including fixed and floating rate debt of approximately 3%. This debt balance includes $50 million in revolving short-term credit lines, which we drew on during month of March as well as the convertible notes issued in April.",
         "During the quarter, we also repaid $95 million of our short-term credit facilities. As to cash, short and long-term investments, we closed the quarter with $1.14 billion. As previously reported, during the second quarter, the company took aggressive actions to further bolster its liquidity position, including raising $343 million in cash and net of expenses through a senior unsecured convertible note offering, maturing in 2025 and adding new committed credit facilities for an aggregate amount of $150 million, taking our total available liquidity up to almost $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter. Furthermore, during the month of July, we closed a secured revolving credit facility for an initial aggregate amount of $105 million. Including this facility, we now have an aggregate amount of $255 million in unutilized committed credit facilities.",
         "Let me close by saying that once this most challenging situation passes, we believe Copa\u2019s Hub of the Americas will remain as the best connecting point for travel in the region, with a privileged location, an even more efficient business model and the best team in the industry. We are working harder than ever with these goals in mind.",
         "Thank you. And with that, we\u2019ll open the call to some questions."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Copa Holdings Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being webcast and recorded on August 6, 2020.",
         "Now I will turn the conference call over to Raul Pascual, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin."
      ],
      "Pedro Heilbron": [
         "Thank you, Raul. Good morning to all, and thanks for participating in our second quarter earnings call. I hope that all of you and your families are doing well and staying safe.",
         "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to thank all of our coworkers for their commitment to the company and recognize their efforts and many sacrifices during these very difficult times. To them, my utmost respect and admiration. Over the last several months, many countries, including Panama, extended their travel restrictions. We have not been able to provide scheduled commercial operations since March 22, and remains subject to the eventual easing of air travel restrictions in the region.",
         "During the second quarter, we completed a total of 86 humanitarian and charter operations, which although only provided a marginal revenue contribution, allowed us to demonstrate our readiness and ability to operate flights with effective biosafety measures. This has been the most challenging quarter in our history. The current demand environment and operating restrictions have had a significant impact on our financial results. We recorded a net loss of $386 million, including significant noncash and nonrecurring charges, which Jose will explain in detail.",
         "Excluding special items, we would have reported a net loss of $114.6 million, our first quarterly loss on an underlying basis in 20 years. During this period, we have obtained new credit facilities, once again demonstrated our ability to control costs and kept our cash burn below our original expectation. We closed the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and undrawn committed credit lines. Our very strong liquidity position and great cost discipline, we believe, makes us one of the best prepared airlines to withstand the crisis. Assuming there are no further extensions to their travel restrictions in Panama, we will restart our commercial operations on September 4. The scaled down schedule, equivalent to less than 10% of our September 2019 capacity.",
         "In the meantime, for the month of August, we have obtained approval to operate a limited number of humanitarian flights. Initially, we will serve 10 cities for passengers departing and connecting via Panama, while arrivals in Panama would be subject to specific approvals by the Panamanian government. Subject to the easing of travel restrictions in the region and the demand environment, our plan is to gradually spool up our network, so that by December 2020, we\u2019re at approximately 30% to 40% of December 2019 capacity. To adjust to this reduced demand and capacity expectations, we continue making changes to our fleet. We finalized the sales of all our Embraer aircraft, engines and spare parts and have agreed to deliver these assets during the next 12 months. We\u2019re also marketing for sale, our Boeing 737-700 fleet and plan to operate a simplified fleet of Boeing 737-800 and MAX 9s. And in order to retain flexibility, we plan to keep several aircraft in long-term storage to be able to accelerate our capacity plans if needed.",
         "Lastly, we have a proven and very strong business model, which is based on operating the best and most convenient network for Intra Latin America travel from our Hub of the Americas, leveraging Panama\u2019s advantageous geographic position with the region\u2019s low unit cost, best on-time performance and strongest balance sheet. Going forward, we expect that our Hub of the Americas will be an even more valuable source of strategic advantage. Especially fewer Intra Latin America markets are able to sustain direct point-to-point service. We believe the Hub of the Americas will be the best position to serve this market.",
         "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jose, who will go over our financial results in more detail."

      "Raul Pascual": [
         "Thank you, Laurence, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call. Joining us today are Pedro Heilbron, CEO of Copa Holdings; Jose Montero, our CFO.",
         "First, Pedro will start by going over the actions the company has taken to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, followed by Jose who will discuss our financial results. Immediately after, we will open the call for questions from analysts.",
         "Copa Holdings financial reports have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards. In today\u2019s call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-IFRS to IFRS financial measures can be found in our earnings release, which has been posted on the company\u2019s website, copa.com.",
         "Our discussion today will also contain forward-looking statements, not limited to historical facts that reflect the company\u2019s current beliefs, expectations and/or intentions regarding future events and results. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and are based on assumptions subject to change. Many of these are discussed in our annual reports filed with the SEC.",
         "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. Pedro Heilbron."

I\u2019m curious how you \u2013 what you view as key for Copa to being competitive in a backdrop where your competitors are going to come out with potentially leaner cost structures?"

So first of all, I have to say that we\u2019re very happy to be able to avoid a Chapter 11 proceeding, which we all know that, that one never knows how it turns out, and it can be a lot more complicated than what one would think. So we\u2019re very happy to be able to stay away from that. It\u2019s good for our shareholders also, of course. We had such an advantage in terms of balance sheet strength, liquidity and unit cost that we\u2019re very confident that after we get out of this crisis, even if our competitors have a successful Chapter 11 process, we will retain, maybe, not the same advantage as before. The gap might close, but we will still have an advantage in that sense. Plus, of course, our very strong Intra America network. We hope that, that will also remain as an advantage. So we\u2019re confident on that."

      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, Hunter, the revenue standard, accounting standard calls for you to make an estimation every month on how much of your sales are going to actually expire a year from the period where you sell and then you basically perform a reconciliation once that moment passes. And you make that accounting entry based on past behavior or past observed behavior that you see. Yes, mathematical formula. And so in first quarter, we are still business as usual. So we follow the accounting rule and perform that entry. But the reality is that given our changes in policy for re-accommodating passengers, et cetera, you cannot determine that, that those tickets are going to expire a year from the first order. So we reversed that expiration entry. So that\u2019s the nature of that."

         "Remarks": [
            "Duane, I think that our capacity for the next couple of years, I think we still have some flexibility in terms of lease expirations with the remainder of the fleet. And so we are now trying to make sure that our fleet matches what could be a demand environment in the next couple of years. So more likely than not, we would \u2013 we\u2019re expecting to return the majority of the lease airplanes that we have, once those contracts expire, to be able to match our fleet size to what we have. So what we have right now, even with the retirement of the 700s and the E-190s is that we still probably see that there\u2019s further fleet moves less to match to where demand is. And so that\u2019s, I think, what we can say about that and just keeping our flexibility open. I mean, on the downside, more anything, just simply to adapt our fleet to where demand could be."

And we have a large order for MAX 9s as we know. And we can work with deliveries. We can accelerate. We can defer. And as Jose mentioned, we can return leases or renew them depending on how demand behaves going forward. So right now, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re protected on the downside. So if things stay low, stay weak, we will have a fleet that can adjust to that demand, knowing that it\u2019s not very difficult for us to increase the fleet if needed, given the flexibility that\u2019s embedded in our plans."

But in terms of our fleet, we can \u2013 our plan is to bring down our fleet to a number that\u2019s going to be in the high 70s, but some of those planes are going to be in long-term storage, depending on demand forecast. And we can bring them out of storage at any time if demand improves. And again, we have the leases we can renew. We have the MAX 9 deliveries. So there\u2019s plenty of flexibility there."

Or which \u2013 what do you think your network will look like on that first kind of 10% that you\u2019re targeting in September? And what data are you guys watching that gives you any change in confidence that this late August time frame is the right time frame?"

            "Right. Well, the right time frame I think no one knows that, to be very honest. So we\u2019re going by when countries are lifting the restrictions, the flight restrictions. What I also mentioned at the beginning of this earnings call is that we have been approved to start flying, where we could call some sort of a mini-hub starting mid-August, the 14th of August. Going to start serving 10 destinations, and that\u2019s Miami; New York; Mexico; Ecuador, I mean, in Ecuador, Guayaquil and Quito; we\u2019re going to fly Santo Domingo. We\u2019re going to fly Santiago, Chile, S\u00e3o Paulo and I think Havana and San Jose. So we\u2019re going to fly around 10 destinations, mid-August.",
            "We\u2019re going to offer connections, connectivity amongst those destinations. And even if the date of September gets delayed, just the fact that we\u2019re already offering this mini hub starting in August, even though it\u2019s going to be, yes, only a few percentage points, we can add destinations as the country\u2019s list restrictions and as demand improves. So once we\u2019re up in the air flying with a small network, it\u2019s very easy to take it from there and just increase service as demand shows up. So that\u2019s the plan right now."

            "Yes. Good morning. Jose, can you talk a little bit about your expectations for non-fuel costs over the next few quarters as you bring back capacity? And then what level of capacity, you think, you need to get CASM ex back to 2019 levels just in the context that you\u2019ll likely emerge in this a little leaner? Can you get back to 2019 CASM ex with a substantially smaller ASM base?"

            "Okay. I\u2019ll start, and then I\u2019ll let Jose complement me. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the second part of your question. Of course, for an airline, it\u2019s very difficult to bring down unit cost to pre-crisis level unless capacity is up at a similar percent. So we\u2019re not focusing so much on unit cost, on ex fuel CASM right now. We\u2019re focusing mostly on bringing down our fixed costs, renegotiating contracts, making costs more variable than fixed, and of course, with two eyes set on our cash burn. And our liquidity. So that\u2019s our focus right now.",

But if I had to give you a number, we think that when we get to the 70% range of capacity, let\u2019s say, of 2019 capacities of 70 \u2013 we\u2019re in the 70% range of 2019 capacity, our unit costs are also going to be in the range of what we had before this crisis, what we had in 2019. And that\u2019s going to be a result of the efforts we\u2019re making to lower our fixed cost to renegotiate contracts \u2013 contract and to make sure that we can have the success we had before at a smaller capacity size."

And so I think when you add all that, it\u2019s probably going to be a 40% reduction versus the baseline at the very least. So \u2013 and here, we\u2019re talking about kind of trying to get shed from the baseline all the \u2013 most of the sort of unnecessary fixed cost that we might have, and we\u2019re doing a lot in renegotiating contracts with suppliers and just simply getting rid of items that we don\u2019t need under a reduced operation scenario.

But maybe you can share what it could look like under the 30% to 40% capacity by the end of the year. Is it possible to hypothetically breakeven at that level? Or is it not necessarily prudent to take that much cost out of the business given it impairs you going forward? Any thoughts on that?"

But we \u2013 again, with the estimates that we have right now, we still will be \u2013 even under a 30% operational, a 30%, 40% range operation, we\u2019ll still be burning a figure of cash."

And there\u2019s also 7, what they call, implemented aircraft, which still need to be built, but everything has been ordered. Maybe parts of it have already been manufactured by Boeing suppliers. So it\u2019s to be expected that those 14 aircraft will be delivered, I would say, in the 18 months after the MAX starts delivering again. So in that 18-month period, it is expected that we could be taking delivery of 14 aircraft, even though we\u2019re still negotiating with Boeing. So that\u2019s not a given right now.

We have a vast, the most complete network, where also there\u2019s a combination of leisure markets and business and VFR. So we expect VFR, basically in France and relatives, to recuperate faster, probably followed by leisure. Business will reach a plateau, maybe, that won\u2019t take that much, but it\u2019s going to take, maybe, longer to go back to what it used to be. But I think we can balance the fact that we have such a diversified market and network to just put more emphasis and capacity where it\u2019s needed most.

I mean, what\u2019s your focus at this time, if \u2013 I mean, that is to, let\u2019s say, have a positive margin of contribution, I think about cash, and not necessarily on margins? And if you can also go a little bit deeper and comment a little bit how your forward bookings look like today?

We think that pricing strategy is probably \u2013 might be different post crisis, at least, for a while. We always strive to have the lowest cost, so we can be as competitive as needed in terms of pricing and pricing reaction to our competitors. There will be lower yields, as we mentioned before, and that\u2019s going to be a way of stimulate new traffic, even though we\u2019re also in other segments that, that will travel because they need to and not tied to pricing.

The government is not really involved with that. The government\u2019s main concern has to do with passengers entering Panama, which they\u2019re limiting to Panamanians and residents of Panama, and that\u2019s what they will control. A broader wise in terms of connectivity and city, we can \u2013 we have full flexibility there.

And I think that the definition or \u2013 it depends on several factors in terms of what decision we make. It depends on just simply keeping the flexibility, pricing on a particular moment in terms of the markets for financing. And so that decision gets made, I think, in each individual sort of campaign that we perform for the financing of each individual airplane, always keeping a balance and trying to maintain flexibility. I think that the fact we have had a portion of the fleet has leased, has provided flexibility in the past, and that\u2019s been okay. But at the same time, ownership of aircraft has been much cheaper for us. So I think it\u2019s a balance. I would say that, that going forward, probably our preference is to own aircraft, but it\u2019s something that we consider, depending on what market conditions are at that time."
