      "Bill Staples": [
         "Thanks, Lew. You covered a great deal of it, but maybe I can add a few details. Having spent the past two decades at Microsoft and Adobe, I learned many things, but one in particular is key to building a successful business, focus the product strategy on creating customer value and great things will happen. And as our Chief Product Officer, I feel like that's my number one focus, to create value for customers.",
         "The reimagined New Relic One platform that we announced last year has a very different value proposition than what we announced just this week. When I say value proposition, I mean the value exchange customers perceive by adopting the platform as experienced through a combination of innovation, packaging and pricing. And last week, as you mentioned, we made dramatic changes to all three. Let me take a moment just to describe in each in turn and why I believe this is an important milestone, not only for New Relic, but for our industry as a whole.",
         "First on the innovation dimension, the product team has been accelerating execution towards this new platform vision and delivered some really compelling work in a short period of time. First, our customers have been telling us since the New Relic One launched last year, that while they love the new look and feel with New Relic One, they needed to see convergence of all our applications and capabilities into a single place, to simplify the user experience and easeful platform adoption. And as you said, we're excited to share that with the launch last week we have achieved that milestone. All New Relic capabilities are now available in New Relic One, and we have migrated 100% of our users to the New Relic One experience.",
         "In addition, we took steps to simplify the first time user experience, build into the product documentation and support, and reduce complexity and adopting more of a platform with guided experiences. We also incorporated a direct in product feedback channel from users directly to our engineering team. And the engineering team has been swarming on customer feedback in preparation for launch with our preview customers, and since launch turning around fixes to bugs and making improvements at times in just hours. This is a massive achievement. And as you can imagine, integrating decade\u2019s worth of IP and migrating hundreds of thousands of users is not for the faint of heart, but I'm happy to share it's gone very smoothly and with less than one-half of 1% of our users registering a complaint or opening a support ticket with us in the day since launch.",
         "Another innovation that we're excited about is as a top contributor for the CloudFoundation\u2019s OpenTelemetry project, we announced that we're embracing an open first approach to all of our instrumentation. We open sourced decades of IP with our own agents and integrations and begun embracing all of the most popular open source tools on the planet as data sources for the telemetry data platform. We\u2019ve been excited to see the community respond not only with enthusiasm, but our first fully implemented poll request or code contribution from outside of New Relic came to us within just hours of the announcement and more in the last few days.",
         "Another potent example of our embrace of open source is our announcement for support for Prometheus, one of those popular open source metrics solutions on the market, which is baked into Kubernetes and has enjoyed widespread adoption. Last week, we announced out of the box support for ingesting Prometheus metrics, with just a few clicks, solving customer problems with scale, retention and security concerns and opening up an all new channel of data that\u2019s completely separate and independent from our own applications. This is just one example of how we\u2019re opening up the platform to all kinds of data, including metrics, events, traces and logs from open source and other commercial systems.",
         "Another powerful example of how we\u2019re delivering a true platform approach is our support for Grafana. One of the most popular, open sourcing \u2013 open source dashboarding tools on the market. Customers can now choose to use our dashboarding tools or Grafana for all the data and telemetry data platform. Customers I\u2019ve spoken with since this announcement have received this news with a lot of joy, Grafana is super popular for a lot of companies.",
         "So second, on the value proposition is the packaging side. And here too, as you mentioned, we\u2019ve made some dramatic changes. New Relic One like one last year was an application first business, which is the same approach as many of our competitors and sold our customers more than a dozen different applications, which collected, analyzed and help them troubleshoot their applications. Well, New Relic One today is a data first business. We believe observability is a big data problem.",
         "And with last week\u2019s release, we took one of the most impressive technical moats I\u2019ve seen in my career, the NRDB technology that we\u2019ve quietly nurtured for over a decade to support our own applications. And we promoted it to be a first class standalone platform for engineers to consume as a service. We believe telemetry data platform is the world\u2019s only petabyte scale, multitenant store for all kinds of operational data. And we\u2019re really proud to offer it as a platform service with incredible economics.",
         "With built-in visualization, programmability and best-in-class support for dashboards, we\u2019re removing all technical and economic barriers to instrument everything and provide a single source of truth for all operational data. We also heard from our customers that the complexity of our own tooling together with the array of open source and commercial tools they need to adopt to achieve full stack visibility is impinging on their efficiency of their engineering teams and driving up costs.",
         "As the company who created the APM category. We\u2019re going to be the ones who ended. We took APM off of our product list, along with all of our other independent products. And as you mentioned, we now offer only three products, the full stack observability product, being a combination of APM, infrastructure, logging and all the digital experience monitoring solutions that we\u2019ve provided in the past, making it the easiest platform to standardize on across your engineering organization.",
         "And last price. I\u2019ve seen some speculation that we\u2019re discounting price to help drive adoption of the platform. And I want to be absolutely clear. We are not discounting price. With our new packaging, we\u2019ve aligned pricing with the way customers tell us they want to consume observability going forward.",
         "We\u2019re unlocking their ability to instrument everything, thanks to the pennies per gigabyte cost of the telemetry data platform and making observability costs more predictable with our per user pricing of full stack observability. We\u2019re proud to be the first major player in this industry to offer full stack observability with a single per user price. We\u2019ve tested this model, as you mentioned, and customers have given us tremendously positive feedback and a willingness in many cases to spend more on New Relic One, not less because it increases and unlocks more value. Thanks. I hope that answers the question."

      "Lew Cirne": [
         "Thank you very much, Peter. Thank you all for joining. I hope you all are staying safe and particularly, on the East Coast, I hope you're managing the weather as best you can. As you can see from our earnings release today, our Q1 performance exceeded our guidance, which reflected expectations around headwinds, including COVID-19 and a seasonally soft first quarter.",
         "Although, we did exceed our guidance, we believe we can and should do better. And we aspire to grow faster. In fact, much of what I talk about during today's prepared remarks, provide our strategy to improve New Relic\u2019s growth rate over the long-term and help the world deliver more perfect software.",
         "When New Relic was founded back in 2008, we firmly believe that applications will become the center of daily living and thus, every business. We understood that application performance monitoring or APM gave developers the ability to see into the health and performance of these crucial applications, ensuring that their customers had a great experience every time they clicked, scrolled or swiped.",
         "Data showed us a great application experiences, whether in the browser or increasingly on a mobile device, drove customer adoption, conversion and affinity, allowing some companies to pull away from competitors as customer expectations were reset higher and higher.",
         "New Relic was at the forefront of this inflection point by delivering a comprehensive APM capabilities as well as a fully managed SaaS offering, New Relic established market leadership and revolutionize both the time to value for developers and scale, speed and performance by designing the product atop a massively scalable multitenant architecture, the very same architecture that has laid the foundation for our next chapter.",
         "Since then, the way software gets delivered and operated has fundamentally changed, as traditional monolithic applications have been redesigned according to cloud-native microserviced architectures. In which the lifetime of some parts is measured in minutes, and the number of discrete components to be monitored have exploded into hundreds or even thousands per application. Added to this complexity is the emergence of DevOps and continuous delivery where software changes are now happening fast and frequently into hundreds and thousands a day in some organizations.",
         "As applications have become more complex, the market has evolved into a variety of monitoring tool to address discrete problems, creating product categories around log management, infrastructure monitoring, APM, and other adjacent categories. Accordingly, vendors in these categories today overwhelm IT and development teams with an array of adjacent, overlapping and disconnected tools.",
         "Each of these tools employs a different user interface and fundamental architecture and each promises visibility, proactive detection, and a mythical single pane of glass through which teams can allegedly see the entirety of their application infrastructure footprint. Meanwhile, the heretofore standard pricing system for APM and infrastructure based on hosts has become increasingly costly and difficult to predict in an age of distributed architectures. It also correlates very poorly to customer value.",
         "Furthermore, when considering other tools related to beyond APM, teams have to estimate and budget according to a number of different and obscure pricing metrics such as page views, mobile users, data retention periods, resulting in a friction-filled provisioning process that often forces suboptimal usage in order to keep purchasing in line with budgets.",
         "In short, current monitoring pricing models create a financial disincentive for teams to instrument all of their applications and infrastructure. Fundamentally undermining the holistic visibility, these teams strive to consider when these solutions were in the first place. Furthermore, customers who adopt these tools encounter surprise overage charges that may cause them de-instrument software or infrastructure to scale back costs further restricting the visibility provided by today's monitoring offerings.",
         "To cope, customers install even more tools, open-source tools, alongside commercial tools, sometimes augmenting and sometimes overlapping functionality. Fragments of critical operational data gets trapped in siloed databases, creating acute bind spots that cripple the team's ability to deliver and operate software effectively. The average organization can end up with dozens of tools to monitor different parts of their stack, forcing engineers, to scramble and switch between these disconnected and often expensive tools to investigate issues while precious time passes in which end users are stuck and disgruntled.",
         "We believe this model no longer works, engineers deserve better. End users deserve better. Customers deserve better. Traditional monitoring technique no longer \u2013 are no longer sufficient to provide visibility into modern systems. Complex punitive pricing from monitoring vendors flies in the face of the mission to deliver critical operational visibility. It's time for a new approach. One predicated on a connected, real view of the entirety of an organization's operational data in one central store.",
         "This approach must be flexible enough to deliver answers to questions. One did not even know they needed to ask or even could ask of all their operational data. This approach must do more than just notify teams when an issue occurs but also illuminate what caused the issue and why. This approach must be petabyte scale with pricing that encourages teams to instrument all of their applications and infrastructure and collect all of their operational data into one central store in near real-time.",
         "As the lines blur between infrastructure and applications, it's more critical than ever to be able to see across your entire software system and get traceability through your entire stack. New Relic to find this approach is observability. Observability describes how well your teams can understand the behavior of a complex digital system. If monitoring tells you when something is wrong, observability lets you ask why. Observability is predicated on upon your software and infrastructure being able to deliver the data, all of the data to provide an answer, supporting questions that lead to other questions that ultimately lead to the ultimate answer.",
         "For a shift from traditional monitoring to observability to happen, our experience shows that customers require the following four things. One, a single source of truth for all your operational data, metrics, events, logs, and traces, not only coming from a vendor's agents but from any source of data; two, comprehensive visibility across the software stack in one unified user experience; three, AI and machine learning driven capabilities to detect anomalies and extract insights in real-time and at petabyte scale; and four, programmability so that customer and third-party developers can build applications and connectors to add functionality, creating an ecosystem of developers and partners.",
         "Furthermore, observability requires pricing and technical enablement such that teams can readily instrument all of their applications and infrastructure, then collect that data. These are the design principles behind New Relic One. When we first announced New Relic One last year, we began a journey to reimagine what we offer our customers from the ground up, starting with the user experience and extending to how customers do business with us.",
         "Simplicity is key to our strategy, across packaging, pricing, adoption and the user experience. Unlike other commercial monitoring tools or related open-source projects, we see New Relic as well positioned to offer the convenience of SaaS with industry best scale and performance at the data platform layer, extensibility, and full integration for open-source projects, to help engineers build and troubleshoot faster, which brings us to today.",
         "July 2020 was perhaps the most important moment in New Relic\u2019s 13-year history with the possible exception of our initial launch in June of 2008. In the last two weeks alone, we have made five major announcements. The first announcement was our commitment to open source release of all of our agents for APM, mobile, browser, infrastructure and all of our infrastructure integrations. Our second announcement was the dramatic simplification of the New Relic product portfolio, from 11 SKUs to just three powerful comprehensive products in one unified platform.",
         "Three, we announced a new customer-friendly pricing model that we believe will define how companies will prefer to consume observability platforms going forward. Four, we announced the complete transition of all of our products, features and capabilities into New Relic One with 100% of our customers transitioned over to the New Relic One user interface. And five, we announced a new powerful perpetual free tier of the New Relic One observability platform that we believe effectively competes with solutions that could cost in the range of $10,000 per year.",
         "New Relic One is how we deliver observability to the market in a way that is unique from any other commercial vendor or open-source stack. As I mentioned earlier, New Relic One now includes three and only three products. The first product is telemetry data platform. Telemetry data platform ingests, visualizes, alerts on all your metrics, events, logs and traces from any source that could include our agents or to conclude third-party sources of instrumentation or telemetry data. It does this at petabyte scale and pennies per gigabyte.",
         "Our second product full stack observability correlates that data from the APM, logs, infrastructure monitoring, client side monitoring and distributed tracing all the way into a single integrated user interface and product, that is easy to analyze and troubleshoot your entire stack in one connected curated experience. Unlike anybody else in our space, we price this product per seat.",
         "Our third product, applied intelligence, to texts, resolve incidents faster than with machine learning models trained using the entirety of a customer's operational data in the telemetry data platform. As is the case with other AI platforms, the more underlying data there is to work, the better the AI. I encourage you to read the investor letter we published today as well as our website to learn more about each of our three amazing products.",
         "During Q1, we conducted many pilots, where we made proposals to a wide variety of customers and prospects using our new simplified model. Overwhelmingly, customers demonstrated a strong preference for our new pricing model. And this resulted in a higher level of willingness to spend and broader platform adoption with us than what would have been the case, where they to have stuck with our previous model. In one or two cases, customers who had been planning to leave New Relic for a competitive solution decided to do an about face and standardize on the New Relic platform, specifically because of this new model.",
         "We've now trained and enabled our sales force to take our new packaging and pricing model to market, including our entire customer base. And while we are very excited about what this will do for our customers and our business, note that it will take time for the benefits of this new model to show up in our financial results.",
         "I wanted to talk about just one more tenet of our strategy, which is our renewed commitment to developers and startups at a grassroots level. We will embrace these thought leaders and future decision makers by providing a robust free tier to encourage usage and adoption of our entire platform, as well as going all in to support key open source projects like Prometheus, Grafana and OpenTelemetry. Additionally, we are making our agents, integrations and SDKs available under an open-source license to increase the pace of innovation and quality in our products by engaging the broader developer community. It is with this community that New Relic was born \u2013 in which New Relic was born and first came to prominence, and it will be with this community that New Relic ascends to the next chapter of our company.",
         "In summary, we are incredibly excited and proud of the product, packaging, pricing and strategy work we have just completed and announced. We have reimagined the New Relic One platform in order to return New Relic to the head of the pack in its fast-growing space, giving shape to the promise of deservability for team struggling with current monitoring offerings. Engineers building, delivering and operating complex highly distributed software have to do their jobs with data scattered across too many disparate tools and data stores. We believe those days are now over. Neither costs nor functional gaps needs stand in the way of organizations seeking to complete their observability mission any longer.",
         "New Relic One provides the ability to collect, search, visualizing alert on all operational data via the telemetry data platform, at massive scale and speed, and that at data ingestion price point previously unimaginable in this market. Full stack observability delivers hyper-connected curated views of that data to speed insights and it's priced per user, which is customer-friendly compared to the array of Byzantine pricing meters that our competitors continue to use. The collection and analysis of all of our customer's data enables New Relic One to deliver AI and ML-driven value like anomaly detection and alert suppression via applied intelligence, making the day in day out work of engineers more efficient and of higher value. In short, with New Relic One we have now simplified what has become too complex. We believe our strategy is one that our competitors can neither copy nor beat.",
         "So that concludes my prepared remarks. And before we jump into the questions from all of you, I would like to throw our first question to our new Chief Product Officer because this is one that we've already heard from an analyst. And so Bill, since we announced New Relic One a year ago, what specifically has changed? What's new today?",
         "Okay. Thank you, Bill. And we\u2019ve gone quite a bit without taking some questions. So I think now is a good time to take our first question from an analyst. So Peter, why don\u2019t you tell to our first question come from?"

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.",
         "I would now like to turn the conference over to Peter Goldmacher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead."

         "We published a letter on our Investor Relations website about an hour ago and hope all of you had a chance to read the letter along with today's earnings press release. Because of the level of detail we provided across the two documents, today's call will begin with opening remarks from Lew, and then we'll just dive right into your questions.",
         "During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements, including about our business outlook and strategies, which we based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors and our most recent 10-K and upcoming 10-Q to be filed with the SEC. Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. We have reconciled those to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And finally, this call, in its entirety, is being webcast from our Investor Relations website and an audio replay will be available there in a few hours.",
         "And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Lew.",

            "This is Philip Rigby on for Rishi Jaluria. Thanks for taking our questions. I have a couple around the announcement open sourcing your agents. So first, as the open source community and products start to build out, could that potentially free up some of your engineering talent on the agent side? And if so curious, where in your platform you\u2019d be looking to shift those resources to if that plays out? And then just on the open source community, can you give us a color on what you\u2019re doing or planning to do to build and maintain the community around open source projects? Thanks."

      },
      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, happy to. So first question around whether this will free up engineering resources. I do believe, the long list, we have more than 300 agents in immigrations to get data into the New Relic One platform. And that is a lot of code to maintain. And the pace of innovation in each of those areas, whether it\u2019s languages or public cloud APIs, or open source systems is immense. And it is difficult and costly for us to keep up with the pace of that innovation. Our commitment to it remains the same. However, I do see the opportunity to innovate and create more value through an open source approach. And as I mentioned customers have been validating that already with their own poll request.",
            "To the extent it does allow our engineers to move into other places of the platform to deliver increased innovation. I think where we would be able to apply more of that engineering capacity would be on the analysis and visualization front as well as our AI capabilities. Increasingly, we believe the future of instrumentation is open. That\u2019s why we\u2019re a top contributor or number three contributor to open telemetry. And the need for standardization on the instrumentation side is just a given. And so to the extent we can bet on and make open telemetry the first class instrumentation path for all applications that will allow us to then shift resources onto the things that make New Relic really unique, which is our incredible analytics capabilities and increasingly our AI layer.",
            "To the question around embracing supporting the community, when we announced open source, we didn\u2019t just throw the code over the wall and publish it on GitHub. We announced we are embracing an open standard and open approach for building the community and operating those projects. So for example, all of the issues will be tracked publicly in the community. We will publish roadmaps in the community. And as I mentioned, take poll requests, which we\u2019ve already begun doing. So it\u2019s a true open source model that we have engineers committed to full time to support in addition to the open telemetry project in the cloud foundation. I hope that answers your question."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. And then it looked like dollar base net retention dipped a little bit in the quarter. Can you just give us some thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about that going forward?"

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, I can take that. So Q1 is a seasonally weak core of our expansion rate. And in Q1, we had several factors that impacted it. In terms of expansions, our non-U.S. business grew year-over-year, but North America underperformed. And this was due to a combination of issues around COVID-19 and a weak economy along with our own execution issues. As you can imagine, given the magnitude of our announcement last week, over the past four months, there's been a broad effort throughout the company working toward this launch.",
            "We included a lot of tests in discussions with customers and prospects as Lew and Bill mentioned. And while this helped define our direction and provided more competence in the long-term success of that strategy, it did take away some of the focus of the team on Q1 results. In addition, we had a leadership transition during the quarter, and we're excited to have a new North America Head of Sales, who recently signed. I think we just sent that announcement out this afternoon. He'll be starting later this month and we're very excited about John Siebert coming over, who's worked with Mike in the past and great experience of both established companies and high growth organizations.",
            "On the other side of the equation of customers reducing their spend. So in the quarter, that number was also \u2013 we had $5 million to $6 million of downgrades that were COVID or macro related. If we exclude those transactions, our renewal rate was up slightly year-over-year. But as we've said previously, we feel our new rates should be higher than they are. And we want to drive to higher numbers and we've been achieving. And when we look at the customer base, what are the dynamics we see with customers who adopt and use the full platform tend to expand their spend. Customers use one product, use the APM only are more likely to say flat or reduce their spend. So this is one of the many factors that drove our new pricing and packaging, making easy for our customers to consume the full platform. By removing this friction around deployment and usage, we're competent. Customers will see the value of New Relic One and expand their spend over time.",
            "Now you talked about going forward. You can see from our guidance that we're looking at roughly flat ARR in this current core Q2, and that's driven by the fact that we are being incredibly generous with our \u2013 with the offering that we've just put out there. We have the free tier, so for low end customers, many of these who would have turned out over time, or they come and go. We're saying, what, you have free use of the entire New Relic platform.",
            "And so we expect a fair amount of our low end customers to convert to free tier users. And we expect over the rest of fiscal 2021 to take $15 million to $20 million hit in ARR of customers that are going to migrating to our free tier. Much of that will happen. We believe in the near term, front end \u2013 front loaded. So we believe that'll have an impact on this quarter. And that will offset much of the increase in ARR we see.",
            "The other thing, we've done is we've entitled our entire user base for the full platform. And we think that sets us up for great long-term success. We want people to adopt it, so they expand on it. But that's we think going to cause near term headwind to our results, but set ourselves up for success in the second half and accelerated growth as we get into next year."

            "Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the major product launch. I wanted to go back to the announcement and sort of make sure that I'm thinking about this, right? There's a lot of components here, but the one that sort of stood out to me is on the pricing and packaging side. And it seems like the focus here is just driving greater consumption of all the new innovations that you guys have put out in the last year, potentially, ahead of monetization. It sounds like Mark, that's sort of what you were alluding to.",
            "So if you had an existing customer, for example, about that's spending a million dollars in ARR today as they migrate that \u2013 migrate to the new pricing and the new packaging platform, what's sort of the impact for that customer in the near term in sort of in year one. I assume it will expand even more vigorously over time, but as we go through this transition, how should we think about the impacts on the customer base?"

            "I'll take a stab and then I'll have Mike kind of fall through. On how we designed the model, let's take a typical million dollar customer. There may be many versions of that. But many of them might be a million dollars almost entirely on APM. And in all likelihood they have not deployed APM everywhere they would like to, right? And that's because like all of our competitors, but we historically priced by the host on APM.",
            "So now with this new model where the bulk of a typical New Relic bill will actually be per user, which is more predictable and better correlates with value. That customer will have more incentive to not only deploy more APM because the marginal cost to add more hosts is low at that per gigabyte pricing on the translated platform, but also very cost effective to add logs.",
            "And there is no new product to buy, no new procurement cycle, so why not add logs? Why not add Synthetics? Why not add more data into the same place to get better correlation, better value, particularly if the economics are so attractive on the data side. And that's why Bill describes as a data-driven product strategy. So we believe there's no reason to expect that all of our customers will suddenly reduce their spend in the short term, some might, but many will increase their spend, but certainly, we expect that this model will incent our customers to standardize on one place as a single source of truth, all their telemetry data that'll drive more users, which will also create a flywheel effect."

And we'd break it into two, three quarter pieces. So we've gone through all the details of what we adjusted in 3Q, 4Q and 1Q just recently. And now we're in the next three quarters segment.",
            "Obviously, this change in the breadth and capabilities of our product portfolio is a huge help. And the transaction model will create a number of other opportunities to drive productivity in our sales force. So I would say that that second three of further refinement of our go-to-market motion, how we approach our customers, the transaction model, we can \u2013 I think we can stick to that timetable.",

And a lot of what we heard in this announcement is kind of driving a platform adoption across that. I guess the question is in order for you to succeed, do you have to have full platform adoption by your customers? Meaning it\u2019s a little bit of all or nothing, or is there a way to still play nicely within the context of a customer might want to use Datadog for infrastructure and Splunk for logging?"

But in those cases, even in some of our largest customers, many of them have withheld deployment of APM to everywhere they\u2019d like to use it, because of the nature of our pricing model.",
            "And so in that case, we believe that this new strategy we put together will increase broader adoption of our flagship product. And it\u2019ll just reduce the friction involved in customers, trying our other products, logging, being very compelling, particularly at the price point that we\u2019re talking about in Splunk\u2019s data platform. But doing that in a way that isn\u2019t an all or nothing kind of bad, it\u2019s an easy experiment to run. And then we think over time, customers will include increasingly standardized in our platform, but that\u2019s not the only way in which we can grow within a given a customer."

As Lew mentioned, we\u2019ve got a lot of customers, who are not instrumenting, not covering their full estate, because of the owner\u2019s pricing, the complex cost structure and the unpredictability of monitoring, and collecting all this data. So, we feel like by making that easier, making that, cheaper for them on a per-unit basis allows them to achieve much better value and cover much more of their applications, much more of their digital business. And so we think it actually expands the overall market. And I think there have been a lot of examples of this historically, where as price goes down, the end goes up by a greater percentage and the overall market expands.",

We can do that, because of our architecture that Lew has talked about and \u2013 but that margin is lower than our \u2013 than our full stack of their ability and other products. That said, we feel like as we continue to go through our migration to the cloud, overall, our gross margins will remain in the 80% range \u2013 80% plus range over the long-term once we get through the cloud migration over the next couple years. And then from an offering standpoint, we feel like that we will \u2013 this will have \u2013 will have no negative impact on our long-term operating margins."

There\u2019s actually, if you look at the blog post that announced it, that\u2019s undermining, there\u2019s a graphic that in that graph, the blog post, that I\u2019ve shown to about 15 CTOs over the last three months, every one of them viscerally reacted saying, this is the world I live in, and what that chart or picture shows is just a huge complex collection of a bunch of different sources of data going to a bunch of different databases and a lack of unity. We\u2019ve seen customers spending over $20 million on observability tools alone, across many, many vendors. Customers routinely tell us they have 20, 30 plus tools all in and around the space of observing what\u2019s going on production. None of them designed to work together, at least in a cohesive way, and certainly, not all in a single data platform.",

And then just going back to the earlier question that tended to ask about, if a customer has $1 million, what happens under the new model, and Lew, you gave the example of a hypothetical customer that was predominantly APM. but there\u2019s a lot of different ways that customers can get to a certain deal size. One is expansive usage; other is upsell, which it sounds like some of those upsells will now be rolled into the packages. So, is the aspiration here that a customer that was $100,000 customer under the old model will be a $100,000 customer under the new model, just maybe looking a little different and around the edges and how they get there, or could you see meaningful variation in those contract sizes as customers roll over?"

So, as Mike said, we\u2019ll go to the new pricing model at the time of renewal. They could say all become an annual pool of funds customer and spend $100,000 with you committed. And then they\u2019ll start to use the platform, they\u2019ll realize the ease and the simplicity of it. They\u2019ll start to adopt it more and more, and they\u2019ll burn through that pool quicker than expected, at which point, we get to \u2013 they get to the end of the pool instead of 12 months, they get to the end of the pool at nine months and we\u2019re talking to them about an upsell.",
            "On the other hand, what we\u2019ve seen in a lot of the pilots we\u2019ve run is that customers recognize that they\u2019re getting a much broader set of capabilities, and they are willing to pay for that at the time that they convert to the new pricing. So, a 100,000 customer, perhaps they say, okay, I\u2019m getting all this incredible value. It\u2019s easier to manage. It\u2019s more simple, I\u2019d like it. I\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll bump up by 30%, 40% or some number. So, I think it\u2019s a combination of both, but the important thing is that we believe over the longer-term, this is going to allow customers to experience the value and make it a much more efficient way on their end or on our end for them to increase their spend."

I believe in general, it\u2019s going to be much more like a force.com like platform, where the applications built on it, are going to be customer specific.",

And in general, it will be customer specific. So, I don\u2019t anticipate many ISVs, building a business on top of our platform in the short-term, but that could develop over time as more and more customers start to do more interesting things on top of our telemetry data platform."

            "Hi, many thanks. I wanted to ask two questions and I'll ask them concurrently. The first is on ARR, the second is on go-to-market. The first on ARR, it wasn't quite sure from the previous discussion, when you anticipated returning to call it 15% to 20% kind of ARR growth, is that in FY2022 that you get there? Or is there some rebound towards the end of this FY, call it December, March, if the benchmark is something like 15% to 20% growth.",
            "And part B of the question is you've guided to basically 10% kind of ARR growth, I know there is a lot of changes going on, but the closest competitor that we have public information on is Dynatrace is growing, ARR by mid-30s call it per round numbers. And while you do have a lot of changes going on, I'm just surprised that the economy or the variance, if you will of those changes, is it SMB related or is there any kind of characterization even as you go through this process about why there's such a difference? And then I follow up if I could on go-to-market."

I would say we spent the better part of the last hour talking about what we are doing to grow faster. And while we've been focused on doing those things that is coming at the expense of more expedient short-term things that could have helped short-term growth. We think we've got a very competitive strategy that we think will put us in a position to be in a leadership position over the long-term. And so the short version of it is, we've done great strategic work and that's come at some short-term costs that we\u2019re willing to take the trade off on."

Previously at the Analyst Day the discussion was an intent to capture more of the higher end of the market, whether it\u2019d be large midsize companies or enterprise organizations. And typically when you're trying to do more of an all encompassing, I think that that makes it tougher to go to enterprise because enterprise have been historically more best of breed.",

So we do well, I think with $1 million plus customers, and that's still a healthy and growing segment. But what we really want to do is grow the number of 100K customers. And those are the 100K-plus customers obviously, and most of them will be medium and large businesses, we think this strategy absolutely is well suited to accelerate the growth of that number."

So I think it was only mentioned that it was around the \u2013 it will be around the time renewals when the new pricing built in for existing customers, right. So I was wondering in terms of just better recovering the salesforce to have some of the conversations around renewals and pricing changes kicking in to make sure that customers don't see like a big sort of like reduction in spend. Like, how are you equipping and stuffs like, what are some of the communication channels that will be used to make sure the customers can maintain their spend, at least in the near-term? That's all from my side guys. Thank you."
