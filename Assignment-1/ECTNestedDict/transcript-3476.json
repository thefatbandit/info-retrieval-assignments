         "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone.",
         "Let me briefly walk through the P&L before commenting on trends we are seeing as we closeout fiscal 2020. For the third quarter, global revenue of $768 million increased 6% over prior-year revenue of $727 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 7%. Core revenue advanced 12%, reflecting a benefit from COVID-related purchases of more than $100 million, new product contributions, as well as approximately 400 basis points from the Breathe Technologies acquisition, which will anniversary in August.",
         "Adjusted gross margin expanded 350 basis points versus the prior-year and peaked at 53.8%, a new record level. This reflects favorable product mix, particularly from higher margin one-time COVID purchases, as well as the impact of new product and portfolio optimization initiatives and the benefit of lower manufacturing and service costs.",
         "R&D spending of $34 million was comparable to the prior-year.",
         "Adjusted SG&A of $197 million decreased 3% primarily as lower discretionary spending, like travel, meetings, and certain marketing expenses more than offset strategic investments to drive future growth.",
         "Given strong adjusted gross margin expansion and expense leverage, adjusted operating margin of 23.7% improved 590 basis points compared to the prior-year, setting a high watermark for the fiscal year.",
         "Interest and other non-operating expenses for the quarter totaled $17 million and the adjusted tax rate was 21%. This translates into adjusted earnings for the fiscal third quarter of $1.95 per diluted share, which is an increase of 59% from $1.23 per diluted share in the prior-year. Excluding the diluted impact of the Surgical Consumable divestiture which contributed $0.07 per diluted share last year, adjusted earnings per share increased 68%.",
         "Now, turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the first nine months of 2020 was $315 million, a 5% increase to prior-year.",
         "Capital expenditures on a year-to-date basis totaled $72 million, $21 million higher than the prior-year, driven by IT transformation costs and capitalized software costs related to R&D investments. As a result, year-to-date free cash flow totaled $243 million.",
         "Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains very strong. To-date we returned $114 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during fiscal 2020.",
         "We ended the quarter with $332 million in cash and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of June was 2.9 times. The first time it's been below three times since the Welch Allyn acquisition.",
         "We continue to operate well within our debt covenants and we have no material debt maturities until 2024.",
         "Lastly, given our refinancing efforts last year, we have access to a revolving credit facility of up to $1.2 billion to address any capital needs as necessary.",
         "Now, before turning the call back over to John, let me expand on the current business trends as we continue to actively monitor the evolving landscape and track potential implications geographically and within each of our three businesses.",
         "As John mentioned, Q3 reflected peak demand overall for 60% of the portfolio, which translated into actual growth of more than 40% for this category of products. As demand for certain products like ICU and med-surg beds begins to normalize, we do expect double-digit growth for other products in this category like thermometry, vital signs monitoring and respiratory products as we exit the year.",
         "Collectively for the 60% revenue category, we expect Q4 revenues to be comparable to the strong fourth quarter last year, resulting in growth of nearly 20% for the second half of 2020. This reflect the current backlog and visibility to orders and no benefits from a second wave. The other 40% of our revenue is now showing signs of recovery and is expected to show sequential double-digit revenue growth as we exit our fiscal year as customer access and physician office visits improve. We continue to expect second half revenue for this portion of the portfolio to decline by about 25%. This is in line with the expectations we shared with you last quarter.",
         "Given the ongoing uncertainty, scope and evolving nature of the pandemic, we're not reinstating formal guidance. We would also not recommend extrapolating our recent results into projections for the remainder of the fiscal year. However, given our results today, and disciplined management of the business, we can say that we expect full-year adjusted earnings of at least $5.40 per diluted share. We look forward to providing you with additional updates in the future.",
         "Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to John."
      ],
      "John Groetelaars": [
         "Thanks, Mary Kay, and good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. And thank you for joining the call.",
         "I'd like to start the call today by recognizing the dedicated, committed, passionate and mission-driven team that we have here at Hill-Rom. It's truly extraordinary. And I do mean extra ordinary. We were called to fulfill our mission to enhance outcomes for patients and caregivers, and as a team, we unequivocally executed to achieve.",
         "Ramping up and shipping two times the normal volume of smart beds, ramping up and delivering seven times the normal volume of non-invasive ventilators, securing our global supply chain, ensuring our workers safety, involving five of our largest manufacturing sites in ramping up manufacturing to meet customer needs, continuing to engage our over 1,200 Field Service employees and rental employees and those involved in logistics and shipping, you name it, our overall operational team delivered excellent.",
         "And this group of people, which is approximately 7,000 employees out of our 10,000 employees, really deserve special recognition.",
         "Next, we pivoted and accelerated our R&D pipeline during the pandemic, launching five new products and pivoting our programs towards innovations to help patients dealing with COVID.",
         "It doesn't stop there. We closed the two acquisitions, and supported our vision of advancing connected care in both patient monitoring and OR data integration.",
         "And if all that wasn't enough for you, we actually did this, while all of our office workers moved to remote work-from-home, and we launched a new website for the company, as I said, extra ordinary, incredible execution by the Hill-Rom team. The combination of our exceptional execution, financial strength, and diverse portfolio underscores our commitment to enhancing value for customers, caregivers, and our shareholders today, and over the long-term.",
         "Moving to financial highlights for the third quarter, we're pleased to report record results that exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line. Core revenue growth was 12% reflecting the durability and strong value proposition of our critical care products and our category leadership in the markets we served.",
         "Core revenue includes a contribution of approximately 400 basis points from the Breathe acquisition and benefit of more than $100 million related to other COVID-related purchases.",
         "We continue to be pleased with our ability to significantly expand margins, achieving a record adjusted gross margin of 53.8%. With disciplined cost management and expense leverage, we posted an operating margin of 23.7%. This resulted in adjusted EPS of $1.95 per diluted share, an increase of 59%.",
         "Before turning to performance by business, I'd like to highlight that growth from new products accelerated again this quarter, resulting in more than $440 million in new product revenue year-to-date, an increase of 40% versus the prior-year. Importantly, this sets a solid foundation for achieving our $550 million in new product revenue, a key objective we set at the beginning of the fiscal year.",
         "I'm very proud of how we pivoted our R&D efforts and recently introduced five new products in the areas of remote monitoring, respiratory care, and surgical workflow. These were highlighted in the press release issued this morning. So given our limited time together, I won't walk through them individually, other than to note that they are all representative of how we're advancing our category leadership and plan to accelerate future growth through innovation.",
         "Geographically, international performance was strong with core revenue growth of nearly 40% due to a surge in demand for COVID-related products like ICU and med-surg beds, thermometry and vital signs monitoring equipment.",
         "As expected, with the exception of Asia-Pacific, all regions generated positive growth, including significant double-digit growth from EMEA, Canada, and Latin America.",
         "In the U.S., growth of 2% reflects the puts and takes across our diverse portfolio. Patient Support Systems led the way with core growth of 12% which was offset by lower revenues in Front Line Care and Surgical Solutions.",
         "Now, let me touch on our third quarter performance by business at constant currency rate. First, Patient Support Systems revenue increased 21%. Core revenue growth of 23% was driven by a global surge of demand for our ICU and med-surg bed systems, as hospitals expanded capacity in the early phase of the COVID outbreak.",
         "The vast majority of the company's COVID benefit that I referenced earlier was from med-surg and ICU beds, which comprised approximately 30% of total company revenue in Q3. That's a full 10 percentage points higher than typical.",
         "During the quarter, we worked through a significant backlog in orders that accumulated during the month of March and April, particularly in the U.S., Canada, and EMEA. This resulted in revenue that was nearly two times the level of prior-year. In the U.S., we estimate that approximately 50% of the peak demand for bed was due to market expansion, while the other 50% was pulled forward from our fourth quarter funnel.",
         "Global demand for beds is now beginning to normalize. Due to the pull-forward effect, and surge demand previously mentioned, we anticipate near-term transitory headwinds for our bed portfolio. That being said, we remain optimistic about recent customer commentary, and prioritization around ICU bed as a top CapEx investment priority, as they balanced capacity needs to treat both COVID and non-COVID patients.",
         "We remain encouraged by the long-term growth prospects of ICU market expansion, which may help overcome some otherwise difficult growth comparisons in coming quarters.",
         "While bed revenue was strong, it was partially offset by anticipated headwinds in other parts of the business, including Care Communications, which was impacted by hospital access restrictions to complete installations.",
         "The good news is that access restrictions are starting to ease, installations and coding activity is accelerating towards pre-COVID levels, and we are currently building a robust funnel that we expect to benefit from in fiscal 2021.",
         "Turning to Front Line Care, third quarter revenue increased 4% reflecting strength in international and one-time non-invasive ventilator orders of approximately $25 million to support U.S. stockpiles.",
         "While we experienced strong demand for vital signs monitoring equipment and thermometry, it was not enough to offset the impact of lower physician office visits in the U.S. on the other patient exam and diagnostic tools, including cardiology, and vision screening. Generally, physician offices are now resuming and recovery towards pre-COVID levels is occurring across multiple areas of our Front Line Care portfolio.",
         "Lastly, Surgical Solutions revenue declined 37% reflecting the surgical consumables divestiture last year. Core revenue declined 21% as a result of project timing and capital delays due to COVID-19. We expect recovery in the surgical business to be more gradual, as OR capital projects, as you can imagine, are currently being deferred by our customers.",
         "With that as a backdrop, I'd like to provide some additional perspectives on our results and visibility to the trends we're now seeing across the portfolio.",
         "As you may recall, we have portions of our business that have been favorably impacted, and those that have been negatively impacted by the evolving market trends. The net impact to Hill-Rom in various regions and product categories will largely depend on the scope, intensity, and duration of the pandemic, as well as the shape of the recovery in demand for healthcare and access into acute care facilities. Given all these variables last quarter, we elected to suspend our previously issued guidance.",
         "And while we're not reinstating guidance today, as the situation remains very fluid, we're now through three quarters of our fiscal year and we have some visibility into our final fourth quarter.",
         "Given the strength of our financial results to-date, including core revenue growth of 8% and adjusted EPS growth of 28% and the evaluation of various scenarios for Q4, we're confident in projecting adjusted earnings of at least $5.40 per diluted share for fiscal 2020.",
         "Our confidence is based on various outcomes of the puts and takes across our portfolio. This includes the assumption of normalized demand for med-surg and ICU beds following the Q3 surge, continued growth across multiple product categories in Q4, and reflects no benefits from a second wave.",
         "In addition, we anticipate recovery across other areas of our portfolio that were negatively impacted by project delays, customer access, and reduced physician office visits. We are pleased with the speed of this recovery and expect double-digit sequential growth for these products as we exit our fiscal year.",
         "So, in summary, amid a challenging environment, our performance to-date demonstrates the advantage of our company's transformation into a diverse and more resilient portfolio of connected care solutions and that is more important than ever.",
         "Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on our strategic priorities, advancing our mission and category leadership strategy, executing on our growth oriented M&A strategy and driving operational execution and strong financial performance in the years to come.",
         "Thanks and I'll turn the call over to Barb.",
         "Thanks Barb.",
         "In closing, we remain confident in the durability of our diverse portfolio of differentiated healthcare solutions. As we move beyond heightened COVID demand, and the transitory benefits, we believe our value proposition got even stronger and remain attractive in the post-COVID environment. And the multi-year growth platforms we've previously discussed can contribute meaningfully to future performance.",
         "Our company is better positioned today than during the last period of economic instability. Our core investment thesis remains intact. Our financial strength, consistent cash flow generation, and the execution of our strategic priorities is positioning Hill-Rom for sustained success.",
         "As I mentioned earlier, the strong foundation we've built is due to the amazing work and dedication of our Hill-Rom team. Their commitment both to our company, and the patients and caregivers we serve is truly an inspiration. Our employees around the world bring our mission to life every day. I feel fortunate to work with such a great team and together we will continue to build on our momentum as we aspire to deliver on our long-term objectives and create value for our shareholders.",
         "With that, let's open up the call for Q&A."

            "Good morning, John, and Barb and thanks for all the excellent detail and the performance in the quarter. So many questions. Maybe I'll start with patient support. John, you can give details about the quarter. But I'm sort of intrigued with your views around market expansion here. I can imagine why you might argue for market expansion. But as part of this question, how does that market expansion characterized in your mind? What's it due to growth? How does this play out over the next couple of years? And maybe you can help us understand on a sustainable basis what this might mean to more normalized go-forward growth for this business?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Rick Wise"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, thanks Rick. When it comes to our PSS business, and in particular, the bed portion of both med-surg and ICU beds, I think what we saw in Q3 and as we outlined in our prepared comments was in fact market expansion. We took a lot of time to detail out that incremental $100 million of COVID-related business, and saw that roughly, we said about half of it was due to market expansion. So and a big portion of that in Q3 was not just U.S. was International.",
            "I can give you examples, I'll give you one example that we talked about last time. In Canada, we sold well over $25 million of ICU and med-surg beds, primarily ICU. And they weren't replacing other beds in that instance. And same with that whole category that we said was market expansion. They were adding new incremental capacity. In that instance, it was done in a hurry, it was done pretty much across the country, and we will well position to support those customer needs in a real hurry. So the fact that we could adapt and respond so quickly to that urgent need in a moment of panic quite frankly led to immediate market expansion in Q3.",
            "And that's why I think in other prepared comments, and I'm sure we'll talk about this. But let me try and address it now. We've always said and I've always said that we're going to see a nonlinear recovery, when it comes to this part of our business. We're seeing a nonlinear expansion as it relates to this part of our business right now. There was an incredibly urgent and significant healthcare need. And Hill-Rom was able to deliver for that need to provide immediate market expansion.",
            "Now, at the same time, it pulled forward a lot of sales that we had in for Q4. But I think to your question with a long-term outlook, we feel really good about the long-term outlook for market expansion for ICU beds and med-surg beds that have the ability to flex-up and become an ICU bed for a transitional temporary period. Both of those are in our portfolio. In fact, you'll see in our website a new dark frame that we're just out promoting now as a Centrella Bed offering that can be flexed up to become an ICU bed offering to provide for this transitory capacity that may be required.",
            "So we think we're really well-positioned, Rick to benefit from this trend. It's a global issue. Many countries require more ICU capacity in the app. We were a clear recognition after the wave that we've just been through that is distinct to happen. And you're seeing a much more measured kind of thoughtful approach around how various healthcare systems do this.",
            "However, I would say we've got a lot of -- tremendous amount of feedback; we've kind of do a lot of research on this topic. And our confidence is very high that we're going to see market expansion over the coming years for the ICU bed market."

         "Remarks": [
            "Great. John, you talked about the Care Comm business. And I'm not surprised that obviously that in the period you didn't have the access you wanted to install. But I'm excited to hear that you're building a backlog and you were very positive about the impact on fiscal 2021. Can you talk about what kind of -- I mean, I don't know if you can give us any numbers about where the backlog is. But maybe can you help us think about what kind of incremental benefit could we see from this turnaround in Care Comm as we contemplate the fiscal 2021?"

         "Speaker": "Rick Wise"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, so our outlook for Care Comm remains really bullish. It's more relevant now and in the future than it has been. We because our Care Comm business is constituted of conventional nurse call and the mobile platform offering, the access into rooms to wire in the systems and install systems and recognize revenue as a result was severely impaired in Q3. As we exited the quarter, things got better. Our outlook in Q4 continues to show a nice route. We believe a very nice recovery as we saw the trend play out in Q3.",
            "So we're quite optimistic that that recovery curve is one of the quicker steeper ones to come back partly because the relevance and the importance of these communication tools to healthcare providers and the expanded feature set that we now provide with everything as we mentioned in some of our presentation materials a new partnership with hands-free voice activated feature on our Volt mobile nurse call system, as well as the earlier acquisition of Excel Medical which brings medical device integration and live waveforms, our comprehensive solution set in that [ph], the mobile building around this business continues to provide a fairly dynamic growth vehicle for the company going forward. So the recovery is coming, it feels like it's one of the quicker businesses that will recover, because of the importance of it. And the long-term growth outlook continues to be one of our brightest opportunities in the future."

            "And just last from me, debt now is 2.9 times. Maybe just talk to us about your thinking about M&A. You feel like just because of all the craziness in the world that are more businesses available or more of the kind of acquisitions that you're interested in available now? And maybe talk through with the help of your outstanding business development strategic team, where are your priorities as we think about the portfolio? Thanks so much, John."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Rick Wise"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks, Rick. Yes, so we continue to be very active in M&A. As we're working through the last quarter and the craziness of the pandemic, we were able to remain very focused with our teams on M&A and continue making good progress. As you heard in this announcement, we closed two small tuck-in acquisitions, one around video integration in the OR, video and OR data integration in the operating room. And then another one around emerging market connectivity solution for our vital signs business, which we're really happy with. Both of those are strategically fit into our strategies very nicely. They both support international as well as U.S. opportunities in the case of the OR integration one.",
            "So we remain very active from a valuation point of view and our rigor around the financial discipline. Smaller privately held companies probably represent better near-term opportunities. It's really difficult for larger and certainly larger public companies to meet our financial criteria in today's environment. But it's not that we're not looking. But I think our strategy around tuck-in and bolt-on M&A is a more likely set of expectations in the near-term.",
            "And maybe, Barb, if you want to touch on capital allocation priorities, I think it was also part of this question."

      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "You know, I think you've covered it really well, John, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. First and foremost, we're looking to support the growth of the business and finding the right M&A deal is top of our list. Absent the right M&A we will continue to support our dividend. We'll continue to look at share repurchases as a lever to offset dilution where appropriate. But absent the right M&A beyond our supportive dividends and share repurchases, we're going to continue to pay down our debt.",
            "We're really pleased in this environment to see our debt ratio decline to 2.9 which is historically low number for us. So we're going to continue to stay disciplined and look for the right deals and the deals that are going to drive our top and bottom line growth over time."

      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, let me probably address that two ways, Larry, one with CapEx and one with our down businesses, the 40% of our portfolio that was negative.",
            "I'll start with the latter, in that group of 40% of revenue that was negatively impacted by COVID; it breaks down to three categories, one Care Comm which we talked briefly about earlier. The second one is all of our physician office businesses in Frontline Care everything from vision care to vital signs, and thermometry, well not thermometry, thermometry is in the other part of the portfolio, but all of our physical assessment tools, and then our surgical business as well as some of the safe patient handling equipment in our PSS portfolio. Those are the three big elements and they're all on different recovery curve, I would say.",
            "Care Comm, as I mentioned earlier is one of the quicker ones to come back. And we're seeing -- we saw a nice uptick in the trend as we exited the quarter. And our outlook for Q4 is kind of getting back to where we hope to show some growth in that category in Q4, if not, we'll come pretty close.",
            "In our Frontline Care portfolio, you can imagine primary care physician office visits were not as high a priority as elective surgeries and the return to healthcare demand. So that that was slow to show recovery in Q3 but did definitely show signs in the month of June. And we're seeing that that trend continue in the month of July. So we're again that's on its way back to pre-COVID type of levels, we believe in the coming quarter.",
            "And then the surgical business as well as safe patient handling, which does involve many times in installing infrastructure in the ceilings of the hospital or in the OR given the importance of OR activity and resumption of surgical backlogs and elective surgery, that's one of the reasons we're not seeing, we don't anticipate seeing a significant increase in those businesses from Q3 to Q4. But we do expect and have schedules to see those product lines coming back in our new fiscal year, starting in October. So they're going to come back, we feel very confident they are going to come back. It's just a slower recovery curve in that area.",
            "The other area I would comment on is CapEx, and in particular, U.S. CapEx, our international CapEx is really not impacted, in the markets we're in and the products we're in if anything is favorable because of the need for more bed capacity, more ICU bed capacity, and are there parts of our portfolio that are experiencing a tailwind in this environment. In the U.S. is where more of the uncertainty is, and I'm sure everyone's heard the commentary on that from providers as well as other companies in the industry. We're actually very favorably positioned. We know that the top one, two -- couple of top priorities for our customers is workflow and clinical communications with both caregivers to caregiver and caregiver to patient that positioned our Care Comm business pretty well as a priority. And ICU capacity and ICU needs for critical care equipment, whether that's vital signs equipment or for ICU bed. So those are going to have relative high priority, even in a constrained capital environment in the U.S. So it will be certainly a challenging environment for the next couple of quarters until hospitals see the full benefit of government stimulus and support.

I guess one thing I was thinking about was certainly the record margins that you set this quarter, but as you start to ramp-down some of that manufacturing that was flexed up to meet COVID-related demand, how should we think about kind of margin in the fourth quarter. And I assume that that'll trend back down a bit, so some thoughts around that? And then on the cash flow from Ops, which was up, as you mentioned 5% year-to-date, looks like your GAAP net income was up significantly more in the year-to-date and it feels like at least as I looked at it quickly, it looks like there's a fairly meaningful increase in inventory. So again, how do we think about kind of inventory levels going forward and improvements in cash flow from Ops? Thanks."

            "Let me start with gross margin. So gross margin for Q3 was at record levels 53.8% and we're really pleased with that. As we highlighted in our presentation that's online about 180 basis points of that really is related to the one-time COVID sale that we saw in Q3.",
            "On a year-to-date basis, if you look at our performance, we're year-to-date for the first nine months at 51.7%. And one-time, we're tracking really well for the full-year. In fact, if you go all the way back to sort of our aspirations at the beginning of the year for our gross margin expansion, we're tracking well against that.",
            "As you think about Q4, there are probably two things that you want to consider. One is that, we won't have the one-time COVID benefit. But the second thing to keep in mind is that the benefit that we've been receiving from the divestiture of Surgical Consumables business has given us about a 50 basis points lift each of the quarter so far this year, that's going to anniversary in August. So we will not see the same level of benefit in Q4. So you want to keep in mind those two pieces.",
            "But overall, in terms of the expansion of gross margin, we continue to be really pleased with it. It's tracking along our long-term aspiration. Volumes and manufacturing variances to-date and in our expectations are going to have an immaterial impact on the full-year. This is really coming down to our efforts on the portfolio optimization, our M&A, our new product launches, and the overall portfolio mix that's driving the bulk of the improvements, supported by ongoing productivity improvements from our outstanding operations team. So that's how we think about gross margin.",
            "As we turn and we talk about cash flow, and we look at inventory, we did have a significant build of inventory in Q3. And really, that was driven by a couple of different things. One of it was sort of a reaction or the result of the fact that we did see parts of our portfolio that 40% of our portfolio we saw softness in demand in the quarter. And we saw that demand. It takes time for the supply chain to matchup with that demand.",
            "The other part of the build was a conscious build, to make sure that we have the flexibility to continue to meet customer demands. And given how fluid the market is, we've deliberately held a little bit more to make sure that we're in a position to meet demand as it moves.",
            "As you think about Q4, I wouldn't expect a substantial change in our inventory levels, as we think about Q4, but we expect as we head next year, those things will all start to normalize more as we go into 2021. I hope that answers your question."

            "But when you do that, you'll see we're projecting a decline in fourth quarter revenue overall, which is heavily driven in fact primarily driven from the surge in bed volume that we saw, and were able to deliver in Q3. And as you know, Bob, customers were desperate to get this product and delivered immediately. Thankfully, we were able to meet those requirements. But as a result of that, we have a nonlinear transition between Q3 and Q4 of our resilient products because we delivered over $100 million of benefits financially around beds, and then another $25 million of non-invasive ventilators that are that that will be a one-time stockpiling order in Q3. So those things don't repeat.",

And quite frankly, it's quite difficult for us to, that's why we're not providing guidance; we don't have the ability to provide an accurate enough outlook on the top-line. However there's enough other levers in the P&L that we feel we have enough certainty where we're on our fiscal year to say $5.40 EPS for the full-year is something we feel confident is the floor and that would give us, if you exclude the Surgical Consumables divestiture last year, that's 11% growth year-over-year. So again, our ability to deliver in highly uncertain times deliver double-digit EPS for our fiscal year is something we're quite proud of."

And then I know it's such an uncertain time. But John, maybe if you could just comment on once we get through all this, like what is your view kind of based on what you know right now, just in terms of how you think about the growth outlook for the business, as you see it right now thinking a little bit longer-term, and what -- from maybe a revenue and earnings perspective, just some rough thoughts on how you're thinking about this, this business long-term based on all the new learnings over the course of the last couple of quarters?

But our overall trend towards gross margin expansion have not been significantly out of line then with where we stated our goals for the beginning -- at the beginning of the year. And I think that that we continue to kind of lean into our expectations around gross margin expansion.",

            "Now, in Q4, as you think about operating expenses, there are a couple of things that will be a little bit different as you think about Q4. One is as John has talked about, activity has picked up and so our spend level is expected to pick-up as well, just because we're out in the marketplace, and we're reconnecting with customers. So it's a different level of normal activity in Q4, plus the investments that we turned on in Q3, we will continue to find as we go into Q4. But our overall commitment to both the growth and operating margin expansion remain strong. And we believe we're on a good path to be able to deliver on those for the year.",
            "The uncertainty around Q4 and where relative to that $5.40 is going to come down to the net impact of the puts and takes on the portfolio and the timing of those. That's really the question and why we're not giving specific guidance, because there are so many moving pieces as you highlighted earlier."

And the results year-to-date and what we're now projecting for the full-year illustrate that, right. The diversity of our portfolio, the resiliency of our portfolio, and our ability to navigate through this pandemic and the financial uncertainty that go with it and still deliver double-digit EPS growth and revenue growth in some -- at some level, we'll know in the next quarter what that full-year performance looks like.",
            "It's pretty remarkable especially compared to our peer group. Long-term, our vision and our direction of going towards a connected care and advancing connected care environment is become more relevant than it ever has been. And the growth vectors will be driven-off of new products which we continue to see nice acceleration in the current quarter. It'll be driven by select investments in emerging markets, and then driving-off of four key product category areas: respiratory health, Care Communications, our smart bed and ICU market expansion opportunities, including flexible ICU offering. And then patient monitoring and the application for patient monitoring and Telehealth and remote patient monitoring, and really connected care in both the hospital and the home for the physical assessment tool excuse me as an example.",

So guys for the fourth quarter, various guidance out there in your deck and it doesn't -- it says kind of assessment of kind of $6.95 to $7.10 range for the fourth quarter is sort of the range implied by your deck. And if you look at your earnings guidance, it applies 17% margins-ish on sort of that number. So are you saying $6.95 to $7.10 sort of isn't the range implied by those slides? Or you're sort of saying we don't have as much confidence in the revenue, we have a lot more confidence in the earnings.

And so as Bob, we don't mean to evade the question in fact, we try to do the opposite. We try to provide you as much color as possible on current results and second half year results, so you can get to that kind of the range that you've just outlined.

Is that a decent way of thinking about the business floor or a decent proxy for the first half of next year or there reasons to believe that in thinking about the peak and the trough third and fourth as an average, that's just not a very good number of 2%?"

Even taking the average of those two, David could present some challenges. You really have to think about the shape and the speed of the recovery that we're seeing in the underlying portfolio. Much as John talked about it earlier, we're seeing different speeds based on whether you're in care homes versus physical diagnostics versus safe patient handling and surgical.",

I think that you're going to have to bear with us a little longer as the pandemic rolls out. And we have clear trajectories on where 2021 will be.

            "Hi, thank you for taking the question. So I just wanted to ask one about the guidance for the 40% of the portfolio that seems COVID pressure. So I'm having trouble understanding the guidance relative to your comments, because you talked in the script about the care comps activity picking up and physician office visits improving. So why would it still be down 25% in the second half, the same as Q3, why wouldn't you see any improvement in Q4?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, good. That's a good question. And the simple answer is tough comps from the prior-year. We normally have a really robust Q4. In the current environment, we don't expect the same kind of seasonality in our business or quarterly phasing in our business because of the situation that we're in. That's why we do see sequential improvement of around 10%. We expect around 10% sequential improvement between Q3 and Q4 on whole.",
            "And then with the comment -- the other part of that is that the safe patient handling and the surgical business which is about 15% of total revenue. So 15% of that 40% is really going to be a little bit slower on recovery, because of getting access to install infrastructure."

And in terms of the TAM that will be available. So that's on an incremental basis, that's kind of a preliminary number that we're seeing."

There's a big difference in ICU bed for Tampa and that TAM, is with you are talking about developed European countries versus also including emerging markets like India and China, how do you think about the differences? And are those included in that TAM as well?"

So that that is the work, we need to finalize, but the number I gave you over roughly $200 million or better over the next four years does incorporate that thinking in terms of market dynamics."
