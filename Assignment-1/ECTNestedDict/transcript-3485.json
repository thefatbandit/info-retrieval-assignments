         "Thanks, Brian. Our operating results in Q2 were healthy and in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we signed close to 1 million square feet of leases across the portfolio, included in this number is an early renewal of our largest tenant in Ontario, for a five-year term at their 317,000 square foot facility in Aurora.",
         "We locked in a very strong above market rent for the property with 2.25% annual rent steps. As a result of this lease, the asset now has a seven-year rolled with steady growing cash flow, providing stability to the overall portfolio. The remaining 650,000 square feet were completed at an average rental spread of 14%. These leases will take occupancy mainly in the latter half of 2020.",
         "Committed occupancy remained high at 95.6%, with occupancy essentially unchanged from the prior quarter in all regions except for the GTA, where we are able to capitalize on vacancy to access significantly higher market rents.",
         "Vacancy in Ontario increased by 9,000 square feet in Q2 compared to the prior quarter, mainly in the GTA. The prior rent in these states were almost 25% below the current market rents. We expect to lease most of this vacancy in late 2020 to early 2021, which should lead to robust CPNOI growth in 2021.",
         "Comparative properties NOI increased by 0.9% for the quarter, driven by higher occupancy and rental rates for Qu\u00e9bec, partially offset by lower occupancy in Western Canada and Ontario.",
         "In Ontario, while rental rate growth was strong, our year-over-year average occupancy was lower due to transitory vacancies mentioned above, including partial rent contribution in Q2 from 110,000 square feet space, which was leased at a rate 14% higher than prior rents and a 98,000 square foot vacancy in the GTA where the prior tenant was paying rent significantly below market.",
         "Assuming a full quarter NOI from these two spaces, same-property NOI in Ontario would have been greater than 4%. We are in advanced negotiations for the 98,000 square foot facility at a starting rental rate that is approximately 50% higher than the prior rent, with the lease commencement in 2021.",
         "In the U.S., same-property NOI increased by 5% due to contractual rent growth and the impact of foreign exchange. We continue to see strong leasing progress for our 300,000 square foot Louisville property and touring activity for the asset has increased significantly. We are in LOI negotiations with a number of full and partial building users and expect to have the building fully or partially leased later this year.",
         "For the remainder of 2020, we have limited lease maturities outstanding. To-date, we have secured commitments on renewals and new leases, representing approximately 90% of total GLA expiring in 2020 and only 3% of the portfolio is expected to mature over the remainder of the year.",
         "Our strategy to work with our tenants has been successful and we have either collected or made arrangements for almost the entire rent due for Q2. In Q2, we have collected 98% of rents due after adjusting for rent deferrals and the CECRA program, representing an increase of 5% compared to our business update at the end of June.",
         "To-date, we have reached 55 rent deferrals, representing 3.5% of our Q2 gross rent. We note that we have received repayments for 25% of the deferred rent already and expect to receive the majority of the deferred amount by the end of 2020.",
         "We are participating in the CECRA program for April through July and already evaluating the recently announced extension of the program to August. We are currently processing applications from just under 120 tenants, which translates into an impact to the REIT of approximately $250,000 per month. So far we have not entered into any additional rent or deferral arrangements for July.",
         "As Brian alluded to in his comments, we are increasing our focus on development and a strategy to generate higher returns on our existing properties, as well as improve the overall quality of the portfolio.",
         "We continue to work through the entitlement for the Range Road project in Las Vegas, which we expect to be completed by the end of 2020. We recently negotiated a land swap with the adjacent land owner, which will increase the building size by 6% to 460,000 square feet and will increase the yield on cost due to greater site efficiency.",
         "We are also making process -- progress in identifying intensification opportunities within our existing portfolio. Currently, we are in early stages of assessing the potential for three sites in the GTA, where we believe we can add 500,000 square feet of density.",
         "I will now turn it over to Lenis, who will provide our financial update."

      "Brian Pauls": [
         "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today for Dream Industrial REIT\u2019s 2020 second quarter conference call. Speaking with me today is Lenis Quan, our Chief Financial Officer; and Alex Sannikov, our Chief Operating Officer.",
         "While the first half of 2020 has been a uniquely challenging time, the disruption caused by the pandemic has brought new opportunities and we are well-positioned to capitalize on them. Back in March, our focus was on preserving free cash flow and liquidity amid the initial uncertainty.",
         "After five months, our portfolio has performed very well and our main growth drivers for DIR remain intact, which are driving rental growth and same-property NOI growth, deploying our excess liquidity into high quality acquisitions at attractive returns, maximizing the value of our assets through redevelopment and reducing our cost of borrowing through euro denominated debt.",
         "Our tenant diversity led to strong rent collections for the second quarter and occupancy has been stable at over 95%. We continue to see rising rent levels in our portfolio and the demand for industrial space is robust.",
         "We upsized our credit facility by $191 million and converted it to an unsecured facility, which unlocked over $265 million of additional unencumbered assets. With ample liquidity and leverage that is well below our target, we feel comfortable in deploying more of our balance sheet to further grow and upgrade portfolio quality while improving FFO per unit.",
         "We are under contract or in exclusive negotiations on $136 million high quality acquisitions across Canada and Europe at an average going-in cap rate of 5.8%. We are currently firm on $58 million of acquisitions in Frankfurt and Dresden in Germany, both of these assets are expected to close in the third quarter of 2020.",
         "The asset in Frankfurt spans 302,000 square feet across three buildings and is a high quality multi-tenant property located in Germany\u2019s top logistics market. With rental rates 15% below market and an attractive weighted average lease term of just under four years, the asset is well-positioned to generate significant cash flow growth over time.",
         "Its urban location is strategically situated within 30 minutes from the Frankfurt City center, as well as the Frankfurt International Airport. We have the opportunity to develop access density totaling over 40,000 square feet, which would increase yields further, completed in the early 2000s. The buildings have a clear height of 34 feet and are occupied by five tenants in the logistics and healthcare industries.",
         "The second asset is located in greater Dresden, Germany and spans 274,000 square feet. The urban logistics asset is 98% occupied with in-place rents 30% below market at an attractive WALT of 3.2 years. In addition, the site coverage is only 18%. This gives us the opportunity to build up to 500,000 square feet of additional GLA.",
         "Both of these assets fit nicely with our European portfolio strategy of assembling a portfolio of high quality, functional mid-Bay buildings in urban locations. While this asset class has high barriers to entry and is seeing virtually no new supply, it also benefits from growing e-commerce demand.",
         "Furthermore, these assets appeal to the majority of industrial and logistics users, including regional distribution, manufacturing and last mile logistics. For example, the Dresden asset we are presently in new lease negotiations with two international e-commerce and logistics users to accommodate their last mile requirements.",
         "Lastly, given the difficulty most institutional investors face in assembling a portfolio of this product in Europe, there\u2019s clearly a strong portfolio premium for this asset class. Furthermore, we are in exclusive negotiations on an additional $78 million of assets in Europe and Canada at an average going-in cap rate of 5.5%. These assets are modern logistics properties that will improve the quality of our portfolio and offer strong free cash flow yields, subject to satisfactory due diligence, we expect to close on these acquisitions later in the year.",
         "Following these acquisitions, we will have acquired more than $0.5 billion of high quality industrial product thus far in 2020, adding 5 million square feet of well-located GLA to our portfolio.",
         "Our continued success in executing on our acquisition strategy during the current market disruption showcases the strength of our acquisition platform and our ability to source attractive investment opportunities in our target markets.",
         "We continue to assemble a high quality portfolio through continued acquisition activity and selling assets that do not meet our return threshold. We are also expanding our development and redevelopment initiatives within our portfolio to enhance the returns on our existing assets and further high grade the portfolio. With attractive distribution yield in the mid-6s supported by high cash flow with a long runway for FFO and NAV growth, we are well-positioned to continue to create value for our unitholders.",
         "I will turn it over to Alex to talk about our operations.",
         "Thank you, Lenis. I\u2019d like to express my gratitude to the Dream Industrial team for keeping our tenants and buildings safe and navigating our business through the challenging environment brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic over the past few months.",
         "We are excited for the gradual and safe reopening of economies in each of our markets. DIR is well-positioned to take advantage of future opportunities in the industrial real estate market, which along with our strong balance sheet, high quality portfolio and disciplined investment strategy will allow us to continue to create long-term value for DIR\u2019s unitholders.",
         "We will now open it up for questions."
      ],
      "Lenis Quan": [
         "Thank you, Alex. Diluted funds from operations were $0.17 per unit for the quarter. FFO per unit was lower compared to the prior year comparative quarter, primarily due to lower leverage, higher undeployed cash balances and higher G&A expenses related to the European expansion.",
         "Other items impacting FFO per unit for the second quarter totaled $0.01 and consisted of CECRA and COVID-19 related provisions and the write-off of unamortized financing costs on our previously secured credit facility.",
         "At the end of Q2, the IFRS value of our portfolio was $2.9 billion, which was relatively consistent with Q1. IFRS NAV per unit at the end of Q2 was $11.75, compared to $11.84 at Q1. The change in IFRS NAV per unit was almost entirely due to foreign exchange fluctuations from a stronger Canadian dollar.",
         "Our balance sheet continues to be robust, with ample liquidity and significant acquisition capacity. We ended the quarter with net debt-to-assets at 28%, net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.4 times and $55 million in cash.",
         "During Q2, we closed on the US$250 million unsecured credit facility that increased our borrowing capacity by $191 million and increased our unencumbered asset goal to $1.1 billion, representing nearly 40% of our investment properties value. Our new facility also allows us to borrow in euros and we expect to draw on this facility in the third quarter when we close on our next European acquisition.",
         "As we continue to access unsecured borrowings to fund upcoming acquisitions, our balance sheet is poised to become even more flexible positioning us well to achieve an investment-grade credit rating.",
         "Looking forward, leasing momentum has picked up since the beginning of Q2 and there are more signs for optimism as the economies in our target markets gradually open up. However, we remain cautious about the pace of economic recovery in the near-term.",
         "We have continued to see rental rates increasing across the portfolio driven by built-in escalators and mark-to-market. However, we are seeing some near-term impact from transitory vacancy with the expected lease-up of these vacancies in late 2020 to early 2021. We expect our quarterly CPNOI growth for 2020 to be dependent on the timing of lease-up of these vacancies and we expect CPNOI growth in 2021 to be significantly stronger.",
         "Following the closing of the $136 million of acquisitions that are under contract or in exclusivity, our leverage will increase to just over 30%, well below our targeted average leverage of 35%. As we deploy this capacity over the balance of 2020 and early 2021, we expect our FFO per unit run rate to rise.",
         "Our strong and flexible balance sheet with ample liquidity and a sizable unencumbered asset pool supports us in executing on our strategic initiatives. In addition, we have access to euro denominated debt at rates that are 150 basis points lower than comparable North American rates. As we transition more of our borrowings into euro, our average cost of debt could decrease by at least 20% in the near- to medium-term, significantly improving our FFO growth outlook.",
         "I will turn it back to Brian to wrap up."

Just wanted to maybe start off with the deferral arrangements and CECRA uptake, could you maybe give us some color as to types of tenants or geographies that are taking up CECRA and then with respect to the deferrals, for July, so far you mentioned there hasn\u2019t been that much. What\u2019s going to make you change your mind on maybe granting more deferral arrangements?"

            "In terms of industries that maybe stand out, these would be what we would call recreational services or recreational users, tenants like gyms that rely on foot traffic in the premises and then tenants in clothing industry and residential would stand out a little bit in our portfolio. But I wouldn\u2019t specifically say that it\u2019s only limited to those.",
            "With respect to deferral arrangements, indeed we haven\u2019t been granting any for other deferrals for July onwards. What would make us change our minds on that is as economic recovery takes shape and we see what\u2019s happening with our tenants and the broader economy, we will be obviously evaluating that. And but for now, based on what we are seeing with our collections based on our conversations with our tenants we didn\u2019t think that, that was necessary."

            "In Western Canada we did see a slight increase in availability for the second quarter just for the overall market. That said, we haven\u2019t seen necessarily that translates into pressures on rent. The reason we have been seeing a slight decline in rental rates from quarter-to-quarter in Western Canada is we were rolling sort of older legacy rents to market. And as that process ends we expect that that will normalize. So far we haven\u2019t seen significant rental pressures in Calgary or Edmonton.",

We currently have -- these are all Canadian dollars, we currently have approximately $300 million in euro assets on the balance sheet as of the end of the second quarter.",

            "But we are also seeing sort of pretty robust demand across the Board for smaller Bay of 10,000 to 20,000 square feet and we have been doing new leases and renewals in that space quite actively at pretty healthy rates.",
            "In the U.S., we are seeing more demand in -- for larger boxes and so for our Louisville property, the pipeline right now is probably as strong as it has ever been with multiple prospects in advanced negotiations, so we are quite encouraged by that."

There\u2019s no real discount in this space for COVID. In fact, some of the opposite and some of the demand that Alex has talked about and the performance that Lenis has talked about is driving further investor interest because there\u2019s other sectors that are not performing as well.",
            "So it\u2019s very, very competitive. Our teams have done a good job finding off-market opportunities and unique opportunities where we can create value. But it\u2019s very competitive in this space in all the target markets we are in and so far there\u2019s not really any discount. There\u2019s fewer offerings, I think, some of the offerings have been delayed to see how COVID plays out, but as we come into the fall we are expecting that to normalize."

But you are correct, I had mentioned that the CPNOI growth we would expect to be a lot stronger and that would largely be in pretty much all of our regions.",

And maybe just a follow-up on that transitional vacancies in Ontario, so are we, I mean, are you starting to receive any kind of pushback in terms of increasing rental rates and do you think tenants in general are in a position to absorb a 10% to 20% type increases what we have done pre-COVID?"

So, certainly, by the end of 2020 and into early 2021 we would see -- we see some traction there, and in terms of acquisitions, we have got some that are closing in Q3 and into Q4, so that will help increase NOI going forward as they close."

So we have not, when we are talking about our collection levels that these are prior to applying any material secured deposits. We may have had in a few instances and that is literally a handful of tenants who have had prepaid rents, let\u2019s say, later in 2020 or into 2021 and those tenants asked us to apply those prepaid rents earlier during the second quarter and we have agreed to those. But we have not been using security deposits as a matter of policy."

How that works and so -- and do you expect any vacancies probably that\u2019s coming next quarter or the following one?"

That said, there are multiple programs out there to assist those tenants, CECRA is one of them. And CECRA isn\u2019t over, and as we said, for those tenants, we will continue participating in CECRA as long as it\u2019s there.",

So that doesn\u2019t scare us, well, there may be short-term pressure coming out of this in a few pockets, overall, this will lead to higher NOI and higher value of the assets."

So it\u2019s actually performing pretty well.",
            "And in addition to that, it also allowed us to activate a bit of a pipeline in the node and we are in discussions with a number of owners in the hope for adjacent sites to ours to see if we can buy them out and these are off-market discussions, so this is quite interesting as well."
