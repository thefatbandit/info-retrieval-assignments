      "Alex Shen": [
         "Thank you, Brett. Good day to everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we discuss at the end of fiscal 2020, we have learning curve challenges on the limited number of projects and the manufacturing schedule, resulting in an unfavorable financial impact. These projects, as well as an unfavorable mix of other lower margin projects contributed to our net loss of $116,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.",
         "This project mix also contributed to slower project turnover, dampening net sales during the first quarter. Net sales were $3.3 million compared to $4.3 million in the same quarter a year ago. Through technical excellence, custom knowhow and custom build approaches, we believe that Ranor has established a dominant incumbent position with the specific projects I just mentioned. These same part numbers are required for the next chipset.",
         "Demand signal for these same part numbers will filter down to the supply chain. The next round will not have learning curve related negative impediments. Given our current backlog and the number of projects on the manufacturing floor, we expect overall improvement in revenues and margins during the remainder of our fiscal year.",
         "The company's sales order backlog was $14.4 million on June 30, 2020, compared with $16.8 million on March 31, 2020. However, we had a very strong month of July, booking over $4 million in new orders. The majority of which should be delivered in this fiscal year.",
         "Now I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Tom Sammons for a brief review of our fiscal 2021 first quarter results. Tom?",
         "Thank you, Tom. TechPrecision is proud and honored to continue to serve the United States defense industry, specifically naval submarine manufacturing, through its Ranor subsidiary. Our strategy to be defense centric is working well. The defense sector demand is strong. In general, commercial sectors are comparatively weaker.",
         "COVID-19 impact is an order of magnitude less in the defense sector. Our Ranor subsidiary has needed no layoffs during these COVID-19-related, very difficult times. Workforce retention is solid. Key customer retention is 100% in Ranor\u2019s defense work. We continue to see meaningful opportunities in our defense sector, primarily in the nuclear submarine business.",
         "I would now like to open up the call for Q&A."
      ],
      "Brett Maas": [
         "Thank you. On the call today is Alex Shen, Chief Executive Officer and Tom Sammons, Chief Financial Officer.",
         "Before we begin, I'd like to remind our listeners that management's remarks may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and management may make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions.

         "In addition, projections as to the company's future performance represents management's estimates as of today, August 13, 2020. TechPrecision assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.",
         "With that out of the way, I'd like to turn the call over to Alex Shen, Chief Executive Officer to provide opening remarks. Alex?"

      "Operator": [
         "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to your TechPrecision First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions and comments following the presentation. As a reminder today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]",
         "At this time it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Brett Maas with Hayden IR. Sir, the floor is yours."
      ],
      "Tom Sammons": [
         "Thank you, Alex. As Alex mentioned, net sales were $3.3 million or 24% lower when compared to $4.3 million in the same quarter a year ago. Our defense sector sales decreased by $0.2 million. However, our order flow from prime defense contractors remained strong. Our industrial sales were down $0.8 million. Gross margin was 21.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, down from 25.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.",
         "SG&A increased by $52,000, as compensation and outside advisory services, more than offset a decrease in travel expense. As a result of the above, operating loss was $96,000 compared to operating income of $368,000 in the same quarter year ago. Interest expense was $58,000 or 24% lower than the first quarter of fiscal 2020.",
         "Net loss for the fiscal 2021 first quarter was $116,000 or negative $0.01 per share, basic employee diluted, compared to a net income in fiscal 2020 of $221,000, or $0.01 per share basic and fully diluted.",
         "Moving on to the balance sheet, we finished with $1.8 million in cash at June 30, 2020. As a precautionary measure, after the COVID-19 outbreak, we drew down $1 million under our revolver loan on April 3, 2020. We repaid this amount in full on June 30, 2020.",
         "In addition, we borrowed $1.3 million under the Paycheck Protection Program. The PPP is administered by the Small Business Administration, and our loan was funded through Berkshire Bank. The loan is eligible for forgiveness under certain criteria.",
         "Our total debt stands at $3.9 million or $1.3 million higher than reported at March 31, 2020. The company has access to additional capital via the revolver loan, so we determined it's necessary to bolster liquidity. Our net debt at June 30, 2020 was $2.1 million compared to $1.7 million at March 31, 2020.",
         "With that, I will now turn the call back over to Alex. Alex?"

First question I have for you is this, I think now the third call that you guys have mentioned, new part numbers that you've been working on and struggle through. And I'm glad you provided that clarity that there shouldn't be these issues as you continue to make these parts. I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense of how many new part numbers there are in total over these past three, four quarters that you've been working on?"

This is the first time I remember you guys calling out a specific number and a specific market. And I don't know if that was because a relatively weak quarter? Or is this something that we should expect to see as the submarine business ramps up this type of run rate maybe not necessarily $4 million, but this sort of high number like that is that something we can expect to be repeatable in the future?"

Under the assumption and we're certainly not assuming or nor asking you to provide guidance to this effect.

So as of last quarter, because this quarter's results were a little lower than last quarter's, so the level of efficiency that you had last quarter and the level of efficiency that is implied by the guidance you provided regarding your backlog and that most of that will be done throughout the rest of the year. Do you feel the need to increase your SG&A by more than 10% or 20%, from current levels to support that?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you. Gentlemen, back in the early 2000s, the U.S. Navy decided to make a leading-edge technology called permanent magnetic promoters, the tool the power Zumwalt-class destroyer. Northrop was put in charge of that project and they brought in DRS who brought in Ranor at the time to build major components for that PMM engine or motor.",
            "And while the navy was not able to use the PMM in the Zumwalt, the problem it was basically too advanced to get all the problems worked out. And basically not getting it bastardized Zumwalt forever. It was in the end, tested and approved by the U.S. Navy per statements made by Ranor in public filings.",
            "Now, Ranor believes a lot in this technology and they actually talked about it in public filing through 2005 and 2008, including showing photographs of the project they were working on for the Zumwalt. Now, as I said at the time the PMM was too advanced, but it did get up, it did get working. And everything I read about the Columbia-class power system sounds to me like it's a PMM. It's got Northrop running the overall, it strikes me as this is probably the modern manifestation of what you tried to do and what you successfully did with the Zumwalt.",
            "And given you, I think are probably the only company in the United States that can produce the type of system at the scale and size that was needed, both for the Zumwalt but also for the Columbia. It makes no sense to me that part of your backlog or part of what your future backlog is in the Columbia-class is going to come from this system. Am I wrong in that assumption? You can say no comment, which I'll take as a yes."

         "Remarks": [

      },
      "51": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Right. And as I said, it appears to me that everything I read this type of technology, this PMM type technology is what is going to be used to power the Columbia-class. Now, at the same time or soon after Ranor started to talk about the use of PMM's for use in the wind industry. In its public filings, it promoted these capabilities and its unique capabilities and everything from its own filings to green technology conferences, as a way to address the PMM need and usage in the wind industry.",
            "Today from what I understand, what I've been told, PMMs are essential to the offshore wind power business. And given that you're located less than 100 miles from New Bedford, which is one of the major offshore servicing call it centers or ports handling the Northeast offshore wind industry. And given that these systems are quite huge and make some both expensive and literally difficult to ship. I would assume -- and my question is why are you not taking advantage of an opportunity that back in the early 2000s you saw as perhaps the central core?",
            "Everything I pick up and everyone I talk to tells me that Ranor is one of the handful of companies, very small handful of companies that can address this need, that this need is growing that we're looking at, perhaps in the outcome of this election, a green revolution and more money being pumped into green energy. And you guys have a capability of addressing something that would be, I think, a very unique green energy play, it would make TechPrecision a lot more than just a one dance pony. It would give you what I see as valuable new markets, which would generate substantial revenues, earnings some free cash flow for the company. You've proven you can do it.

And we'd leave them making all the money and we'd be sitting there with nothing but frustration.",

Why do I keep hanging on here, when you guys are technologically one of the most advanced I'll call it metal vendors in the country, and someone else is going to recognize that if you guys don't?"

And the ramp up it depends on the flow of orders and the speed of the flow of not just the orders, but the infrastructure support that comes through it from our customer base. Our customer base, the defense centric customer base. As we've seen in all the public information available there is much more outsourcing that is happening from both shipyards, Newport News as well as Electric Boat.",

I'm only aware of the few that I get a chance to take a look at. I think the speed at which the outsourcing happens is also a function of how much outsourcing have they done on these part numbers that they've all traditionally made in-house before. That is a big factor on how to outsource to a vendor, what they've always done inside. It's not always the easiest task. It's actually quite difficult many of the times.",
            "The impediment is the speed. And what we face with our Ranor subsidiary is some of that -- much of that is out of the control of our Ranor subsidiary. As we work through each new part number that comes through the cycle at Ranor, the next time it comes through, it's much easier. So, it's in our best interest to continue to be part of the trend of outsourcing and be outsourced, and secure new part numbers and continue to do that and somehow help the speed."

            "So, I joined, let's see, 6.5 years ago. Before I came on board, I was reviewing, what the Ranor subsidiary had done in the past and what dire straits they were in and when I took the company over. The lack of strategy, we needed a strategy to work with. It needed to be customer centric and it needed to be married to the operational capabilities of both the people and the machines and the processes.",
            "Ranor is very good at doing complicated parts that are high specification driven, difficult parts and large parts. We don't make small widgets. There's a large complicated parts that need to meet great number of specifications. And there are two plants on site, one is a welding fabrication type of plant, and the other one is a machining type of a plant. We needed to take those capabilities and find a set of customers that would not just be furnishing work for a job shop, onesy, twoesy, but really over an extended period of time provide some type of a base load that could be counted on.",
            "So, in looking at that, the United States government is the biggest consumer in the entire world. And the defense industry happened to be a piece of what Ranor was providing. So as we looked through, Tom and I looked through the customer base, it looked to be the best recurring opportunity was the defense centric opportunity. However, we think it's wise to keep our eyes open and be opportunistic at any other opportunities in the industrial sector, in the nuclear sector, in different sectors that Ranor was in as well.",
            "So having said that, we go back to what are the repeating part numbers that have constantly repeated through the history of Ranor. The repeated part numbers that have constantly repeated there are none. If you go past a few number of years and a project ends, then the repeating part number part of it also ends. At one point in time, I think there were these nuclear, these casks, but that business ended.",
            "However, when we look at the defense industry and long lived nature of the Virginia-class attack submarine, we're currently on block five. There has been a tremendous number of these built and then there's going to be block six and block seven that's also already in the public eye. So that's public information.",
            "The opportunities continue throughout, so in wanting to make sure there's a base load and not have the floor drop out from under us that was a studied decision to make ourselves defense centric and the two shipyard centric. And through them the primes that are also the same serving the same Virginia-class. And Columbia-class was coming. Columbia-class is the replacement of current Ohio-class. There are 12 boats scheduled for Columbia-class. And that opportunity spans over three decades of work. And we saw early on that the capacity needed to support those two classes of submarines was not completely supported by the shipyards themselves any longer. There was indication of inclination of outsourcing, which now has been pretty publicized.",
            "So, in essence, the repetitive nature of incumbent part numbers is very attractive. And the longevity of the intended base load driven by Virginia-class and Columbia-class is very attractive, more attractive than any other opportunities over the long-term. But we still need to be very aware of and be very opportunistic on pursuing other areas non-defense as well."

It may seem obvious, but are you confident that if you continue to execute with your defense customers that TechPrecision will become a profitable company that will generate significant revenues and cash flows in the years to come, built off of that recurring revenue base from your defense customers?"

Well, the business question is yes, I am confident. And Tom and I didn't come over here, if we were not confident on the long-term possibilities, but also on the short-term, to be able to recover the company and get it back on track, and get it healthy enough, and actually get away from non-traditional banking to a regular bank.",

         "Remarks": [
            "Awesome. And one quick question that I'll just follow-up with. Do you have a timeline over which you're evaluating that defence centric strategy where, obviously you mentioned if you needed to change that you would? Is there a timeline that you envision where if it wasn't coming to fruition, you would re-evaluate? Or do you see any need to re-evaluate at all over the coming years based on the information you have?"

      "114": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I think it's foolish for us not to continue to re-evaluate as we go along. Sometimes I think it's going the quarter-to-quarter look is not the right look, because the period of performance spans more than the quarter and sometimes it spans more than the year, it depends. But the re-evaluation has to be constant. We need to continue to re-evaluate and not take it for granted.",
            "What has changed? Is everything okay? What is different? Is okay or acceptable anymore? Do we need to -- what adjustments do we need to make? Because the blocking and tackling might need to change, where overall the strategy may not, but the blocking and tackling itself, the daily management might need to change and it does change. And those adjustments must be made. We're making those adjustments now, in spite of COVID impacting all our consumables that are regular commercial items. We're taking those changes, and we're finding alternatives to doing the work.",
            "The respirator masks that were completely off the shelf anymore, how do we do our work without the respirator masks? Well, we need to get different ones. Where do we get those? How do we do that? Where do we buy that? Our supply chain is broken because of COVID. Okay, we'll find another different supply chain for respirator masks. That's just one specific item. But I think the evaluation goes much deeper than just an overall overarching strategy itself. But the ability to execute the strategy down to each worker, down to each piece of their personal protective equipment, down to each piece of what they actually use as their tool, their insert. There's a number of items that really need to be evaluated again and again over and over, just to make sure that we have what we need to not only pursue more, but to maintain what we have. The maintaining of what we have is absolutely essential in guaranteeing our future to go get more. I don't know if I'm making any sense."

And I'll echo Mark's comments that the additional color that you've provided over the last few minutes has been extremely helpful to me, and I'm sure even more helpful to investors who aren't quite as familiar with the business that you took over and how it's progressed over the last six years. So, best of luck and looking forward to experience new opportunity."
