         "Thanks, Mike. As I did last quarter, I\u2019m going to keep my review of our results, relatively brief to allow more time for questions. Second quarter sales were $6.61 billion. Sales increased 4% quarter-over-quarter and decreased 8% year-over-year as adjusted. The average euro-dollar exchange rate for the quarter was exactly in line with our expectation. Global components sales were $4.72 billion. This was above the high end of our prior guidance and represents an 8% year-over-year decrease as adjusted. I mentioned last quarter that industry destocking has been going on for more than one year.",
         "This quarter, global component sales increased sequentially for the first time since the second quarter of 2019. Demand in Asia has been resilient. And as we expected, the Americas and Europe were hard hit by the aerospace and transportation industries. Global components operating margin was 3.8%, down 10 basis points year-over-year. This was mainly due to regional mix with Asia contributing 45% of global component sales, up from 37% in the first quarter and 38% last year. Enterprise computing solutions sales of $1.89 billion decreased 8% year-over-year as adjusted and were above the midpoint of our prior expected range.",
         "As we\u2019ve said in the past, uncertainty is bad for IT spending, and enterprise computing solutions is likely a later cycle business than global components. That said, we believe some of the delayed investments in mission-critical technologies cannot be pushed out indefinitely. Billings were approximately flat year-over-year, adjusting for changes in foreign currencies. We experienced strong demand for security and storage solutions, while demand for servers and networking declined meaningfully year-over-year.",
         "Global enterprise computing solutions operating income margin decreased by approximately 60 basis points year-over-year to 4.3%. And similar to what we saw in the global components business last year, demand from smaller customers who rely on more of our capabilities has been weaker in this downturn. Demand from larger, better capitalized customers has been more resilient. Returning to consolidated results for the quarter. Interest and other expense of $32 million was below our prior expectation due to lower borrowings and lower interest rates.",
         "The effective tax rate of 24.1% was in line with our expectations. Earnings per share were $1.59 on a diluted basis, exceeding the high end of our prior expectation. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We reported strong operating cash flow of $418 million. During the second quarter, we reduced borrowings by approximately $257 million, principally through the maturity of a $209 million 6% note retirement. Our balance sheet is in great shape, and our liquidity position remains strong. Current committed and undrawn liquidity stands at over $3.2 billion, excluding the $206 million cash balance that we have on hand.",
         "We\u2019re closely monitoring credit and receivables. Collections remained healthy and DSO increased, but in line with DPO. This was due to the further expansion of customer engagements during the quarter that are neutral to working capital. As we\u2019ve said in the past, it\u2019s fair to measure our performance by the cash conversion cycle, not by any one metric in isolation. The second quarter cash conversion cycle was four days shorter than last year.",
         "We returned approximately $75 million to shareholders during the quarter through our share repurchase plan. The remaining authorization under our existing plan is approximately $113 million. The new $600 million authorization increases the total to $713 million. Please keep in mind that the information I\u2019ve shared during this call is a high-level summary of our financial results. And for more detail regarding the business segment results, please refer to the CFO commentary published on our website this morning.",
         "Now turning to guidance. Again, this quarter, we\u2019re providing wider-than-normal ranges to account for increased volatility, given the current environment. With that said, we\u2019re forecasting consolidated sales to be approximately flat compared to the second quarter with higher global component sales and lower enterprise computing solution sales which is typical for the third quarter.",
         "We expect a slight increase in earnings per share compared to the second quarter. However, the percentage decline in earnings per share looks unfavorable on a year-on-year basis. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, current demand conditions in the Americas and in Europe remain significantly depressed for both businesses. With that,",
         "I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."
      ],
      "Mike Long": [
         "Thanks, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. First off, I\u2019d like to thank our global employees for their commitment, professionalism and teamwork during these extraordinary times. The critical engineering, design and supply chain services they provide to our customers, our suppliers and partners create technology that protects and improves our way of life. The health of our people always comes first. And thanks to their thoughtful and diligent work, our offices, our facilities have been kept safe, and our business is moving forward.",
         "Over the course of a few months, we\u2019ve learned a lot about the practices necessary to keep the business going while protecting our people. We remain diligent. We\u2019re increasingly optimistic that we have found a sustainable way to do business and actually thrive in the coming quarters.",
         "On April 30th, we provided an outlook for the second quarter. We recognized then and now that to guide innovation forward, we must maintain our reputation for transparency. In addition, we have a long-held belief in the power of data from the billions of transactions we do with thousands of customers across dozens of industries.",
         "As a result, I\u2019m pleased to report that we exceeded our quarterly earnings guidance for the quarter. In fact, we\u2019ve met or exceeded our guidance 46 times in the last 50 quarters. As we reflect on what we can do to achieve long-term success, it\u2019s important to recognize both the items that are in our control and those that are not.",
         "We can\u2019t control the demand for cars, data center equipment or electronic devices. However, we can continue to position our business for rapid sales acceleration and mix shift to higher-margin engineered components and solutions.",
         "One way we\u2019re doing that is by adding to our engineering and our sales teams today. We\u2019ve seen great opportunity to drive leverage from design, engineering and marketing that will benefit our customers and suppliers. Another way for Arrow to position for the eventual improvement in demand is to execute on the business model and to strengthen the balance sheet. Our results this quarter showed just that. Cash flow from our operations totaled $418 million, $1.7 billion over the last 12 months, and we have also reduced debt by $1.1 billion over the last year.",
         "We remain confident in our long-term strategy and execution. Therefore, we increased our commitment to returning excess cash to our shareholders with an additional $600 million of share repurchases. Arrow remains focused on maximizing our near-term opportunities, while positioning our business for the long term. Design activity reached an all-time record for any quarter in our history, and our design activity has actually increased year-over-year for the third quarter in a row.",
         "Typically, this is a good leading indicator of an improving market, and this is why we keep investing in our engineering capabilities. Other indicators are consistent with short run stability. Second quarter backlog increased from the first quarter, the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement. Lead times were consistent with the first quarter and with last year. Global components book-to-bill was 1.07 exiting the second quarter. Book-to-bill was highest in the Asia region where the pandemic recovery is happening sooner.",
         "Our Americas customer sentiment survey showed some improvement. The percentage of customers saying they had too little inventory increased compared to last year, and the percentage of customers saying they had too much inventory decreased compared to last year but also remained higher than normal. To date, we\u2019ve not faced significant challenges securing the parts our customers need. Turning to enterprise computing. In the second quarter, sales were slightly above our midpoint expectation. Like last quarter, we experienced strong demand for the solutions that enable the work from home and the business continuity.",
         "Security software sales were strong, and storage sales increased compared to last year. We remain confident in the consistent growth from data from connected devices and objects, and we believe that, that will be a long-term tailwind for our business. Taking a step back, I want to emphasize that as a company, we have a long history on capitalizing on downturns and disruptions. And despite the current environment, we continue to improve our team\u2019s leading design and demand creation for global components.",
         "Hybrid cloud for enterprise computing solutions, and we can fund these investments with efficiencies that we gained from our superior operational platform, and we expect these investments to drive exceptional profit leverage in the long term. In closing, we\u2019re continuing to support our stakeholders and communities. We\u2019re committing to providing our customers with the products and solutions they need when they need them. We remain disciplined and focused as we operate our facilities and businesses through these uncertain times.",
         "Over the last several months, we worked diligently to avoid disruptions and are confident we\u2019ll continue to do so as we operate as a critical provider to the global technology and industrial ecosystem. We will not stop looking for opportunities to expand our business, drive innovation and improve the performance of our end customers everywhere.",
         "I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Chris to provide more details on the second quarter results and our expectations for the third quarter."

As you said, over the past 12 months, it\u2019s substantial amount here in the first half. But do you anticipate generating free cash flow or cash flow from operations in the back half of the year, but maybe at a slightly lower level? Any details on that would be helpful."

So if you normalize that out, that kind of rate, I think, is something that\u2019s not unreasonable for the back half, certainly what we\u2019re targeting."

And then if you could talk about the big industry consolidation that was announced intraquarter and whether you think you could be a potential beneficiary as it closes in 2021?"

            "That\u2019s a great question, Shawn. I appreciate you asking it the way you did. Actually, so far, anything that we\u2019ve seen from any supplier programs has been not material. In fact, the growth rates we\u2019ve seen, our book-to-bill came positive, the backlog increasing quarter-to-quarter has been more broad-based growth for us right now. And we really aren\u2019t expecting a windfall from anything, to be honest with you. If anything happens in 2021, that would be great.",
            "We welcome it. We don\u2019t have to add any cost. We\u2019re prepared to handle anything that would come our way. But the I want to be clear that what we\u2019ve seen in bookings, backlog, the inventory increases has really been broad based with Asia Pac leading the way. And then obviously, the business in North America and Europe not being as healthy as it has or as we\u2019ve seen in the past. But things could have been a lot worse in both of those locations, too. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable that we\u2019re going to be looking at some progress in the second half."

            "I just wanted to maybe first touch either Andy or Mike. Obviously, western regions and components are challenged. This was initially the case in Asia, but that seemed to bounce back very quickly. I know this is a million-dollar question. But if you could just touch on the time line to recovery in EMEA and Americas and how that might be similar or different than Asia? It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to be September based on guidance. Could you see year-over-year growth in the December quarter in those regions? Just any color or commentary would be helpful."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. What we\u2019ve seen so far and is a steady increase in bookings. We\u2019ve seen a steady increase in backlog. So we don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any double ordering going on or anything like that at this point in time. We have seen customers being resilient. And what I mean by that is, typically, in a downturn, once you see the design activity really start to pick up, that sort of has in the past given us a signal. Now we\u2019ve never had COVID on top of an economic decline.",
            "And I want to be clear. If you go back and look at this, the economic decline started before COVID, and then COVID was laid on top of that. So if people can stay open, I would think we would see a steady increase in performance from here. And there\u2019s just so many things that start to stop it with geopolitical tariffs, some of the silver bullets that the U.S. did to themselves for manufacturing. But all in all, we\u2019re feeling pretty positive about the second half outlook.",
            "We would be expecting something a little more in the December and January quarters. Yes, that would fall in line with the normal decline and a normal return out. But we\u2019re not expecting a huge V-shape thing. Right now, we\u2019re seeing it build steady, and we actually believe that, that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work."

         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. That\u2019s helpful, Mike. Maybe you could just, as a follow-up, touch on operationally, how you\u2019re thinking about reaching a turning point for the declines in operating margin and operating profit dollars. We know Arrow is a best-in-class operator, but the metrics are off right now. And if I heard you right in the commentary that you\u2019re committed to keeping investments versus cutting costs, which seems to make sense based on what you\u2019re talking about. So maybe just double-click on that decision on why and the timing to see the turning point in operating margin and operating profit dollar declines?"

      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, if you take the operating margin of the Company right now, and compare it considering we\u2019re down, I don\u2019t know, something like $700 million, right, year-on-year here, it\u2019s how quick that $700 million come back. But if you were to lay the $700 million on top of our cost and what you see today, I think you\u2019d see a very different Arrow coming out of this downturn.",
            "And I think that\u2019s really a positive. We\u2019ve really been able to take back office efficiencies and move them toward the front office. So if you look at our costs and investment is really not an investment. It\u2019s a transferring of funds that we already have. So I think the important thing to note is, we\u2019ve made the Company much more efficient than it was prior to going into this downturn. And we\u2019ve added revenue-generating resources that get paid on additional revenue. So that has become a variable cost for us versus all those fixed costs we had before.",
            "And we were really able to do that because of that platform, that computer platform change that we, as you know, finished 1.5 years ago. So we\u2019re now starting to get the benefits from that investments, and we think it\u2019s going to be even more efficient when we get back to those same levels. Will we\u2019d be back to that in January? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t call it. It\u2019s really going to be based on Europe and North America. But the real positive that I can tell you here is look at how much the mix of Asia was this quarter and then think about the mix of adding those other two and bringing them back. It\u2019s going to be a pretty positive story."

So when you think about recurring revenues within ECS, do you think that, that can grow over time as a percent of total revenue? And can that help the margins and the stability of the revenues?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Thanks for the question. And by all means our recurring revenue is absolutely growing. Keep in mind, we\u2019re going after two really important future growth opportunities, both of which we believe represent better return opportunities for us. One is all about the market for hybrid and multi-cloud, and we\u2019re going after that through our platform called ArrowSphere. We think it will be a big piece of our selling motion in the future. And the other is all about continuing to add line card with software suppliers that are very relevant when it comes to the management to support and the security of these client deployments.",
            "The reason we like that forward look and that investment strategy is that, in fact, more and more of that business will be recurring in nature. And as we did just as we deliver on those revenue streams through a digital experience, we do expect the contribution margins will improve over time. So our recurring revenue in the second quarter grew by north of 40% as delivered through our ArrowSphere platform, and we think that\u2019s a good sign of our continued participation in the cloud marketplace."

            "Maybe, Chris, another question for you is you talked about the free cash flow, which was strong. Given that your liquidity position is also strong, at this point in the business cycle, would it make sense to look at inorganic growth, maybe look at M&A? And you just had a new $600 million repurchase authorization. So maybe just give us your thoughts over the next 12 months on uses of cash. How you think about buybacks versus M&A versus reinvestment in the business?"

However, we don\u2019t see anything out there of a size or a scale that would largely change the complexion of Arrow at this point. Secondly, as you know, our uses of cash, we\u2019ve been very clear. Internal growth was another investment of ours, and we believe we\u2019ve largely put in all the investments we need to operationally to grow in the future, which really leaves us with additional sales and engineering people down the road as the customer base would expand and as the sales would expand.",
            "And then third was our return to shareholders. Well, as you know, going into the downturn, we had accomplished the first two, but we really didn\u2019t give our return to the shareholders. And we believe right now, where we are in the cycle with the pandemic with our balance sheet, right now is really the perfect time for us to do a share repurchase. And so we\u2019re really going to pursue that avenue at this point. Chris, would you like to add anything more to that?"

So we would normally expect pretty good operating leverage in the quarter. Right now, it\u2019s tough to see too far past Q3. What I would say for Q3 is that we\u2019re looking at similar mix and demand trends as compared to what we saw in Q2. There\u2019s still some tailwind associated with work and learn from home. We think that our security pipeline looks fairly healthy. Lots of customers need to secure their virtual and remote working environments. Hardware is a little bit of a mixed bag.",
            "Obviously, the overall IT spending environment on-premise is down for lots of good reasons. But we\u2019re actually doing okay from a data storage perspective, and that has a lot to do with the size of our installed base and frankly the adoption of the new architectures, specifically hyper-converged. We really have a good representation and good exposure to that market. I think if you look at a large company versus small, the more business we do in the larger end of the market, the more challenging that gets from a gross margin perspective.",
            "As Chris pointed out, the mid-market and the partners that serve them tend to be the places that more fully appreciate our value. That will come back. Your guess is as good as mine as to when it does. But we\u2019re fairly confident in our strategy, and we\u2019re going to stay on the path I just outlined a few minutes ago, and I think that will that will bode well for operating margin in the future."

And what are you seeing so far in July? And related to that, I think in the Chris, in your CFO commentary presentation, you mentioned that European margins in the component business decreased in the second quarter. I think if I recall correctly, this is one of your more profitable areas in the components business. Can you talk about the reasons behind that? If that\u2019s what\u2019s the outlook for that reversing in the second half? Thanks."

            "Nik, this is Andy. I\u2019ll take a swing at this one. So from a bookings standpoint, it was, as Mike mentioned in his commentary, it was very much Asia led. And that started off pretty much through the April and May time frame and continues into June and beyond. So it was a slow and steady ramp through the quarter. I guess the way I would articulate it with June being the high point. July has been pretty normal in terms of the way that we see the July bookings rate continue.",
            "So that gives us some confidence in the outlook going forward. In terms of your second question, I think what Chris said was the operating margins were diluted by mix rather than any specific business having any individual dilution effect, and that was because Asia jumped from 37% to 45% of our business in the quarter, which has the dilution effect. It wasn\u2019t about individual businesses having any quarter-on-quarter declines, if that answers your question, Nik."

Can you maybe just elaborate how much of that is due to share gains, given you highlighted power management strength? And how much of that is due to the market demand stress in Asia?"

So it\u2019s an economic rebound for us from what we saw before and just sort of a bounce back after COVID. Hopefully, it will continue on through the year. But as you know, we\u2019ve been increasing our engineering and sales capabilities in Asia, and that has paid off very well for us over the last couple of years. And we\u2019re seeing that really take effect. As far as market share, I don\u2019t have market share figures in yet. It\u2019s way too early after the end of the quarter. But I\u2019m not assuming any major share change quarter-on-quarter. I think it\u2019s a pure economic there."

So all of these comments are tempered by COVID and what was an economic decline before. Typically, in an economic decline, the high engineering products are the ones that customers stop buying first, so they\u2019re trying to control their inventory because that\u2019s where the vast majority of the dollars are.",
            "Then you go into your decline and you start seeing customers start to redesign products for the future. And I think we just said that we had a record design quarter for new customers, new products, which is good. So the expectation is clearly for the margin to go up, for the operating income to go up as demand starts to return. Because we think it will inordinately impact the engineered products as the demand starts to come back. So hopefully, that answers the question as to why and what."

Would you say there\u2019s any other layer on that? You mentioned investments that are kicking in different designs, et cetera.

And if you really look at the mix and sort of how the operating income came and everything else, if you just went back to traditional and as I argued before, put the other two regions at normal run rate back on top of this, and you\u2019ll see a very, very interesting story."

But their priorities for the last quarter or since COVID came were to keep their workforces deployed, right? So everybody spends, invest and had to create work from home opportunities for their employees, or frankly, you will shut down.",
            "So when you think of the resilience of the companies out there to be able to do that because we know not every company who\u2019s ready for this. They have to take sort of any data center type purchasing and back that off. So all of those projects that we\u2019re bidding in the big data center are sort of pent-up demand now. I don\u2019t think they go away because I know here, our issues we have in IT didn\u2019t go away, but they weren\u2019t the highest priority. Our highest priority was to get all of our people to be able to work from home.",
            "And when you think about being able to get 20,000 people to work from home and then effectively improve that over the quarter, so we could do it as a byproduct with a big speech. So if you think about just, Steven, our own spending here, I\u2019m expecting that the fourth quarter going into the first quarter, we\u2019ll start to see some change in the marketplace. I really don\u2019t know about the third quarter because I can\u2019t gear up just yet how much is COVID, how much is market. So I think we have a pretty conservative view of our guidance going out there. But I do know that these projects are not going to go away."

So yes, we think the inventory is about where it should be right now. That little bit of increase you saw was sort of late in the quarter inventory coming in for shipments that went right back out in July. So it\u2019s a minor part. But remember, sales were up 4%. I think inventory was up 3%.",

So many times when we\u2019re helping a reseller financially, we\u2019re also getting some benefit from a supplier to help that reseller. Therefore, we sort of stay neutral in that piece of it.

They\u2019re actually well above last year in terms of our ability to collect. But there has been a mix shift as to where the product is flowing. And to the point that we made about better capitalized, it\u2019s exactly what we saw in components, right?",

We\u2019re going to be there for them in the future just as we are today, and we\u2019ve got, as Chris pointed out, really rigorous process in place, if your question is about risk to make sure that we\u2019re managing our AR portfolio very carefully."

The first thing is, we\u2019re having, and I\u2019m going to use the term no, I\u2019m sure there might be one or two customers out there. But with our increases, with suppliers, we\u2019ve seen no customer pushback on doing business with us or doing more business. This is a D&A where prices are what they are. There\u2019s no real competitive nature of just buying on price. The competitive nature is in the flow of the product and helping with cash flow, helping with designs and things like that.",

And our goal is to support our customers to the utmost of our capability and our suppliers the same thing.
