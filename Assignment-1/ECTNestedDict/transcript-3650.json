         "Than k you, Yvonne, and thank, everyone, for joining us today. We hope that everyone continues to remain healthy and safe as a global COVID-19 pandemic persist. The second quarter was a most challenging yet in the company\u2019s history as a public company.",
         "We experienced a 76% sequential reduction in the number of our systems deployed to customers. Global COVID pandemic drove a severe fall off in both commodity demand and prices resulting in swift and extraordinary reduction in activity by the oil and gas industry.",
         "The industry\u2019s response was particularly felt by those of us exposed to the completions part of the value chain, as operators began curtailing production and significantly slowing or halting fracking operations.",
         "Despite these extreme circumstances, I\u2019m very proud that our team took immediate action that enabled the company to produce a breakeven adjusted EBITDA and another quarter of positive free cash flow and what we believe was the bottom of the cycle.",
         "During the second quarter, Solaris generated $9 million in revenue, adjusted EBITDA of negative $400,000. Our six consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow and paid our seventh consecutive quarterly dividend despite the very challenging market. The Solaris team achieved all of this while learning to work remotely, adapting to the organizational change and continuing to service our customers innovate and operate safely.",
         "I mentioned on our last call that we\u2019re in uncharted territory and that continues to be true today. The ultimate pace and level of recovery are still unknown, as we expect the bulk of oil and gas operators will remain disciplined and stick to the development budgets they laid out at the onset of the pandemic. However, we are encouraged to see many of our customers resume a modest level of completions activity in recent weeks, expect activity in the third quarter to be at 35% to 45% over the second quarter\u2019s if these levels hold.",
         "Our plan for navigating this downturn is unchanged. We began by controlling what we could and adjusted our cost structure to match the current level of activity. By reducing headcount was one of the toughest decisions we had to make. We also looked more creatively at our cost structure and found ways to reduce costs that were more structure on nature.",
         "For example, we took out some of the overhead layers in our organization and in source several functions both at the field and support levels. These are changes that should allow us to remain lean and efficient even as activity comes back.",
         "As operators were making plans to come back to work, we focused on staying in front of them, highlighting our commitment to continued improvements in service quality and innovation. We believe our ongoing focus on technology, innovation and service will help differentiate our offering during this challenging time. We remain focused on helping our customers improve the efficiencies of their hydraulic fracturing operations.",
         "While we are no longer building new systems, we\u2019re continuing to work on our pipeline of system enhancements and new products. Our software offering is one example of this. Our customers crave and rely on the valuable supply chain and activity information we provide them to help them operate as efficient as possible.",
         "Our Solaris Lens offering continue to rollout upgrades and new capabilities that allow our customers to see more information and analysis in real time. We\u2019ve also made system improvements that will help our customers track their sand use data by stage and well with increased accuracy.",
         "Our focus on cash integration remains strong and we\u2019ve made efforts at every level of the organization to make sure our collections remain strong and no unnecessary cash is spent. The focus, combined with our debt free balance sheet has allowed us to continue sharing our excess cash with shareholders. Our cash balance is unchanged from the beginning of the year, which means all of the over $30 million of cash flow we\u2019ve generated year-to-date has been returned to shareholders.",
         "Our free cash flow and strong balance sheet allowed us to maintain our dividend payment at $1005 per share during the second quarter, the quarter in which we saw a nearly 80% reduction in our operating activity.",
         "Our conservative approach to our balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to be measured in our capital allocation philosophy and avoid the need to potentially overreact short-term changes in the industry landscape. Our investors were the predominant source of funding during the build out of our company and sharing excess cash with them remains an important focus for us.",
         "We also continue to make progress on our ESG transparency with investors. Last year we launched the new sustainability website. In the coming weeks, you can expect our first sustainability report to be published on our website. We look forward to further engagement with the investment community and our customers and how we can be more transparent and ESG friendly in the future.",
         "To summarize, while the extent and duration of this downturn is out of our control, we have and we\u2019ll focus on what we can control, running as lean and as nimble as possible, ensuring our customers receive exceptional and dependable service, and improving our offering to service our customers.",
         "With no debt on our balance sheet and a healthy cash balance with continued expectation for cash flow generation. We have many opportunities available to us to continue to grow and enhance our product offering, invest in our people and service quality, while also returning cash to shareholders.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Kyle."

      "Kyle Ramachandran": [
         "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter we generated over $9 million of revenue, adjusted EBITDA of negative $0.4 million and positive free cash flow of approximately $22 million. We averaged 24 utilized systems deployed to customers, which represents a 76% sequential decline.",
         "Total revenue declined 80% sequentially, driven by a reduction in activity, as well as a reduction in last mile services, which has a large trucking component at past year margins. While we aggressively cut costs throughout the quarter, adjusted EBITDA declined to breakeven as fixed costs were absorbed over a smaller activity level and some variable cost cuts lagged the drop in revenue.",
         "A total of 63 proppant systems worked with varying degrees of utilization in the second quarter. Our calculation of 20 fully utilized systems reflects the number of equivalent systems that generated revenue every day in the quarter, which we believe is the best measure for modeling purposes.",
         "The average rental revenue per system in the quarter declined approximately 13% due to a combination of lower pricing and mix impact. While we believe our pricing is bottom for the time being a full quarter impact of the revised pricing should result in an average revenue per system decrease of 3% to 5% in the third quarter relative to the second quarter.",
         "Beginning in the second quarter, we moved estimated credit losses out of the SG&A line to the other operating expense lines to give you a closer reflection of our SG&A run rate. Total SG&A costs for the quarter were approximately $4 million, inclusive of non-cash stock-based compensation. For the third quarter of 2020, we expect total SG&A to be approximately flat at $4 million, inclusive of the normal quarterly expensing of non-cash stock compensation.",
         "During the quarter we generated a GAAP net loss of $5.5 million or $0.20 per share. Adjusted pro forma net income for the second quarter was negative $7 million or $0.16 per share. As a reminder, adjusted pro forma net income, adjusted non-recurring items and also assumes a full exchange of all Class B shares for Class A shares for a more comparative period-over-period presentation. Please refer to our press release issued last night for a full reconciliation of adjusted pro forma net income.",
         "Operating cash flow was approximately $23 million in the quarter, after total capital expenditures of approximately $1 million, our free cash flow was a positive $22 million for the quarter. During the quarter our accounts receivable balance decreased 77%, as our team made substantial progress on cash collections. We returned a total of approximately $5 million to shareholders in the second quarter in the form of dividends, which was flat with the prior quarter.",
         "Since the company turned positive free cash flow in early 2019, approximately $63 million or roughly half of the cumulative free cash flow has been returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.",
         "We ended the quarter with approximately $64 million of cash on the balance sheet. The increase from the $46 million in cash at the end of the first quarter was primarily due to accounts receivable collections and partially offset by a decrease in our payables and accrued liabilities.",
         "Now turning to our outlook, as Bill mentioned, we anticipate the fully utilized U.S. frac crew account could be up between 35% and 45%, sequentially, in the third quarter, as many operators resume a modest level of completion activity.",
         "We expect our business to perform in line with the overall sector, with identified opportunities to outperform through targeted share gains as activity normalizes and as customers continue to recognize the value of partnering with Solaris, including a cycle of continuous innovation and a balance sheet with staying power.",
         "As activity improves modestly in the third quarter, we expect EBITDA should improve slightly. The large working capital benefit in the second quarter should not repeat and we believe working capital could have a neutral to slightly negative impact on cash during the quarter.",
         "We also expect to remain discipline on capital spending. We\u2019re narrowing our guidance for capital spending for the full year 2020 to between $5 million and $10 million, compared to our previous guidance for $10 million or below.",
         "Our debt free balance sheet and more than $60 million in cash provide Solaris the opportunity to excel during this downturn, while preserving optionality to opportunistically and thoughtfully evaluate both organic and inorganic growth opportunities, while also returning cash to shareholders.",
         "With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions."

         "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you of our standard cautionary remarks regarding the forward-looking nature of some of the statements that we will make today. Such forward-looking statements may include comments regarding future financial results and reflect a number of known and unknown risks. Please refer to our press release issued yesterday, along with other recent public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that outline those risks.",
         "I would also like to point out that our earnings release and today\u2019s conference call will contain discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating our performance.",

Obviously, it was a very low base to come off of, so percentages sound really large, but we\u2019re there today and if they hold to where we are today through the quarter, then we\u2019ll see those kind of increases."

And then, Kyle, you said, EBITDA to improve slightly, I wondered if you could give us some more context around what slightly means to you all. We could do the math and the model, but just to make sure, I\u2019m not missing any moving parts on the cost side or anything like that? What is slightly mean to you guys?"

            "Yeah. I think, again, on a percentage basis, it may look significant, but for a really low, basically small negative EBITDA on the second quarter to somewhat positive in the third quarters where we see it.",
            "From a cost standpoint, we brought down a lot of costs at the end of the first quarter and in the second quarter. So we\u2019re operating at a lower cost environment. So we\u2019re going to benefit from that as we look at revenue increasing and not necessarily needing to layer in any additional G&A or even at the direct costs line item. There may be some additional costs at the field level, but it won\u2019t be up nearly at the level that the revenue is expected to be up. So we will see margin expansion. But again, we\u2019re not looking at a return of, say, Q1 profitability levels. It\u2019s up significantly, but we\u2019re still coming off a very low base."

            "Got it. That\u2019s super. How about I\u2019ll sneak one more in, if I could and it\u2019s a longer one. I apologize. But just been struggling with, you\u2019ve heard a lot of services companies so far this earnings season talk about Q4 and worried about the typical seasonal slowdown. And I\u2019m just curious why you would stop and start, why you would start activity in the third quarter and then stop it in the fourth quarter absent some sort of exoticness factor that since crude oil back down again, I realized weather can kick in, there are some holiday, but I would imagine folks aren\u2019t going to mind working through the holidays at this point. So, just curious what your dialogue is with customers around Q4 \u201820 and if they\u2019re actually indicating to you all that there\u2019s going to be a slowdown in the fourth quarter or if this is just kind of if that\u2019s conservatism, PTSD from the last six years, eight years of this kind of crazy activity that we\u2019ve had. How is that customer dialogue?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. I think that there isn\u2019t much dialogue with it other than most customers set the remaining budgets for the year. It\u2019s really going to be highly sensitive on the price of oil. I think if you continue to see it remain in the low 40s. That we probably don\u2019t see the seasonal fall off that we have in the past, but it\u2019s highly probable.",
            "And I think you hit the nail on the head a little bit here, it\u2019s -- we don\u2019t know people are willing to work that obviously service pricing is down significantly and so, taking it, while those expect 2021 to start really ramping back up and they may want to take advantage of the lower prices and go ahead and either continue to drill some wells or complete some ducks through the fourth quarter."

            "As we\u2019ve alluded to you in the past, we\u2019re a culture of innovation and tinkering and coming up with new ways to improve processes and so we\u2019re still continuing to invest in those projects and that\u2019s flown through the first half of the year. There\u2019ll be a little bit more that spend in the second half of the year.",
            "But I think the reason we brought the guidance in the $5 million to $10 million versus under $10 million, we\u2019re just try and provide a little bit of a narrower range there. But we\u2019re not anticipating significant increases in CapEx at this point."

         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. Appreciate that. And then my second question is just related to mix that that you noted in the prepared remarks. Can you talk about how, whether that\u2019s customer mix or systems working on some kind of standby type rate? How did that impact margin in the second quarter and how does that flow into the third quarter?"

         "Remarks": [
            "It\u2019s all of the above. So we went practically to our customers during this challenging quarter, and said, how can we work prac -- how can we work constructively with you to help you achieve your goals.",
            "And some of the things you hit on, which is looking at standby days, looking at a revised rate structure. And some of the way to think about it is, we set volume based pricing with a lot of our customers and when we saw frac count come down 70%, 80%, those pricing bands were somewhat no longer relevant.",
            "So if you had an operator that was running 10 frac crews and they were down to two, they may have received a pricing discount at, say, eight or 10 crews. So there was no visibility to be able to get back there.",
            "And we still wanted to create a culture where the volume weighted pricing is a strategy we use to capture all of the work of an operator or pressure pumpers. So it was sort of right sizing that piece of it. And then, yes, as there were bigger gaps and activity, the standby rate provides an ability for us to keep systems with customers versus having them returned to us.",
            "So, the kind of breakdown of all those different components is not something probably we\u2019ll get too deep into, but it was just sort of an equally weighted mix is probably the best way to think about it at this stage."

You guys have always run a really leaner organization. But I\u2019m curious if there are any insights with respect to efficiencies or anything else that you think could enable an even more streamlined or efficient organization as activity recovers? Bill, you hit on a couple of these earlier in your prepared remarks, but I\u2019m just curious, if you could flesh that out a little more."

            "Yeah. I mean, obviously, we would love to not be paying rent in an office building right now, but it\u2019s a different world. I think the team has really rallied around. The use of -- sitting in -- sitting at your home and being on a Zoom call or Microsoft Teams call and enforcing with a culture of really a lot of collaboration around, making things better, improving service quality, understanding when we have an issue or a downtime or a problem with the system, we spent a lot of time root cause analysis, figuring that out and working with our customers to make sure that we don\u2019t cause them any problems.",

I think, fortunately, we have the team that is gotten some of us older folks getting used to use the technology that we have over the last four months or five months has been pretty amazing and remarkable.",

So it\u2019s just, I think, a testament to how it is, how this all shakes out over the next six months to a year. It\u2019s nobody -- it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess, but we have just made sure that what we can control, which is our business. We\u2019re getting it done and we\u2019ll continue to get it done."

We delivered value that the price is easily justifiable. So our focus has really been on efficiencies.",

I think that the general value proposition in the making the supply chain more efficient and making the wellsite operations safer, cleaner, more organized is something that system provides.",

How do we get more efficient? And what are the kind of equipment and processes that we can use as an operator or pressure pumper to make our operations more efficient, less people intensive.",
            "The AutoHopper has as gained market share, if you will, in our fleet as things are ramped up. It\u2019s just working and I think our customers see the ultimate value in making their operations more efficient by automating more and using that tool.",

And we first go into it, everyone\u2019s hair\u2019s on fire, cutting as fast as you can, I think, coming out of it is a measured. How do we get more efficient? How do we complete these worlds better going out of it and I think we\u2019re sort of in that phase right now."

But the other thing that we\u2019ve pivoted to very quickly is offense. The offense is in not only the quality and efficiency that our products provide, but were also set up from a capital standpoint to thrive in this kind of environment.",

So it just allows us to be very focused during this downturn with fewer people on the team, being remote. It does have its challenges, but we\u2019re focused on the priorities."

So there\u2019s -- the footprint of completions activity will look quite a bit different, more concentrated in the stronger basins in the second half than they did in the first quarter.

But it would seems to be that your incremental margins going forward as we get to maybe a more stable baseline of revenues. Your EBIT -- your incremental EBITDA margin should have some durable improvement over what they would have been otherwise before we went through the streamlining exercises of the past few months. So, do you have any maybe logarithms that you can share with us in terms of how you think about EBITDA incrementals into maybe a continued sustained improvement into next year?"

But in all seriousness, yeah, no, I think, two things. One is, we have leaned out the cost structures, so we\u2019ve taken out some layers in the organization to more streamline that. We started at such a high gross margin structure to begin with, that we didn\u2019t have a ton to squeeze out, but I think, we are set up to benefit from margin expansion with a lower cost structure going forward."

Obviously, we had a big working capital benefit on free cash for the second quarter and that\u2019s you spoke to that expectations going forward being less influenced by that. So I\u2019m just curious with regard to the doctrine around the dividend, if we are bumping around plus or minus free cash flow before the dividend for maybe one, two, three more quarters before the business begins to structurally improve. Is that any cause for heartburn with dividend sustainability if you need to lean on the cash balances by a quantum or would you and the Board, I say, be comfortable to keep the dividend where it is and drawdown cash in a scenario where free cash flow dips modestly negative for a quarter or two?"

            "But I think we view ourselves as sort of experts in what we do and if there are opportunities to add some bolt-ons that can help enhance our offering, diversify offering, provide additional value to customers that that\u2019s where that lies.",
            "And that could be a, as you said, a very small software business. We did that in late 2017. We bought Railtronix and we\u2019ve integrated that into our business and continue to use that today. And then, but it also could be a piece of equipment that fits right into what we are doing that, perhaps, provides better visibility into the quality of various materials going into the frac or measurements that can help our operators operate more efficiently. So I think it\u2019s all the above and we\u2019re open it all, but we\u2019re a very disciplined as well.",
            "And I think, one of the things we\u2019ve been talking about recently is, there\u2019s a handful of companies in our position today within our space, small oilfield services, companies with public currency, cash on the balance sheet, no debt. We haven\u2019t seen a ton of M&A and I think that\u2019s partially driven by the discipline of these companies, whereas in years past, we\u2019ve seen more M&A on step out basis than what we\u2019re seeing today.",

So we may see less M&A and just more attrition going forward here and businesses that become potentially absolutely on a -- we recognize as an overall smaller addressable market for the near future, combination of structural over supply versus demand and commodities, but then also just through the efficiencies of capital equipment."

But it -- now at this point, some of your competitors are distressed and maybe not maintaining their equipment or their services well as you guys can.

Do you expect that to grow on the way up out of this kind of trough year? And do you think there\u2019s any opportunity to improve the economics of providing that service? Clearly, if you\u2019re an E&P, you\u2019re very thankful that if you haven\u2019t made commitments for silos or sand, if you have flexibility that\u2019s provided by a third-party, so you\u2019re able to move your cost structure seamlessly without taking hits.

            "As to the structural nature of it, we have not layered our business from the capital or from a personnel standpoint with a bunch of fixed costs or assets. So we haven\u2019t gone out and bought trucking capacity. So we can track for it with partners that we\u2019ve worked with for a lot of tons, I\u2019ll say, with a lot of tons of these partners.",
            "So we\u2019ve got the flexibility in it as well. And on the sand side, generally speaking, we really haven\u2019t been involved in that component. The operators had -- have been purchasing that directly. So I think from a structure standpoint, we\u2019ve protected ourselves pretty well.",
            "And then from a return standpoint or from an economic standpoint, that model is all driven by the efficiency on location. So our people going to pump more tons or less tons per day going forward and as they pump more ton, if you\u2019re exposed to the variable model, which the last mile is, it does provide for actually, it probably enhanced economics versus the pure rental business.",
            "So it\u2019s got its puts and takes, if you\u2019re working for an operator or a pumper that\u2019s running into some troubles in a particular month, you may not pump as much sand, and therefore, the comparable rental margins may be lower.",
            "But then there are other periods where we\u2019re actually able to benefit from an operator and a pumper really being in sync and knocking a bunch of stages out. So it\u2019s -- it does have a little bit more variability associated with it. But we\u2019ve set up, I think, our structure to ride that way."
