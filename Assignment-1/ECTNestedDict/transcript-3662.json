         "Thank you, Sylvain. Good morning, everyone. On page 14, if we look at numbers on a per unit basis, FFO adjusted for the quarter was $0.20, a decrease of 28.3% over Q2 2019. AFFO adjusted for the quarter was $0.13, a decrease of 36.6% for Q2 2019. As a result, here the AFFO adjusted payout ratio significantly increased 138.5%, compared to 90% in Q2 2019. This is obviously due to the current COVID-19 we are going through.",
         "Moving on to page 15, we have said that the pandemic had a negative impact on our FFO of $17 million for the quarter. Our revenues were hampered by $11 million due to the pandemic. $3 million is attributable to the decrease in rents, essentially due to percentage rents and the lack of temporary rentals. Another $3 million is attributable to the declining parking revenues. And finally, $5 million is attributable to the decline in operating cost that are charging back to the tenants.",
         "Additional expenses of $17 million mostly composed of expected credit losses were partially offset by $11 million of savings consisting of maintenance savings for $8 million and an energy savings for $3 million related to the inoccupation of our properties due to the pandemic. Ultimately, our NOI and FFO experienced a $17 million or $0.09 per unit decrease due to the pandemic.",
         "Moving on to page 16. Year-to-date, we have written-down cad 329 million of the value of our assets due to new prevailing apparently and market assumption impacting value. This amount to 4.9% of our Q4 2019 value.",
         "Our Retail assets were most affected with $252 million write-down or 11% of the Q4 2019 value. Office assets were written down by cad 44 million and Industrial assets were written-down by $33 million. About half of the overall write-down are $165 million came from our enclosed malls portfolio representing the 12% decrease with respect to their year-end 2019 value.",
         "Moving on to page 17. During the quarter, we up financed $22 million of mortgages. We also completely $150 million of unsecure debenture offering, which proceeds were used jointly with cash on hand for the early repayment of the $300 million sales force senior unsecured debentures that were due in July 2020.",
         "Finally, we secured $120 million secured credit line. As a reminder, our liquidity at Q2 stood at $434 million, of which $34 million in cash and $400 million available under our unsecured credit facility. We feel comfortable with that level of liquidity available given our debt maturity.",
         "Moving on to page 18. Our total commitment for the rest of the year totaled $181 million, of which $81 million of mortgages that are in the process of being refinanced as we speak for a seven-year term. Worthy of mention is the fact that our 2021 mortgage maturities include [inaudible] Montreal mortgage for $240 million, which is being extended for another year until 2022.",
         "Moving on to page 19. During Q2 2020, our debt ratio increased to 54.5% as the consequence of negative fair value adjustment on our investment properties. The pending sale of the property in Montreal CBD, that is part of our properties held for sale will subsequently novelist to reduce our overall leverage.",
         "Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio experienced a slight increase at 11 times. Our unencumbered asset pool stood at $2 billion, representing 1.77 times, our unsecured indebtedness stable from last quarter.",
         "Moving on to page 20. Investments in Q2 2020, in capital expenditures, leasing costs and leasehold improvements totaled $19.4 million, down 38.6% from the same period last year. The year-to-date CapEx stands at $53.2 million, down 16.4% from the same period last year. Including investments in development activities capital expenditures in Q2 2020 totaled $26 million, down to 34% from Q2 2019.",
         "For the year-to-date period, total CapEx stand at $67 million, down 8% from the same period last year. Target for the year remains at around $150 million, which implies a remaining $80 million to $85 million to be spent by the end of the year.",
         "I will now pass it back to Sylvain for the concluding remarks."

         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Cominar Second Quarter 2020 Earnings. At this time, all lines are in a listen-mode only. But following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]",
         "Also note that the call is being recorded on Friday, August 07, 2020. And I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Sylvain Cossette. Please go ahead."

      "Sylvain Cossette": [
         "Thank you, Suzie. Good morning. And welcome to today\u2019s conference call where we will be discussing our financial results and highlights for the second quarter of 2020. The presentation for this call is posted in both English and French in the Conference Calls section of our website. In line with our disclosure principles, access to this call is open to financial analysts, investors, the public and the media. The question period will be open to financial analysts.",
         "Before I begin, I would like to draw everyone\u2019s attention to the notice concerning forward-looking statements on page two of the presentation.",
         "With me today is our Interim CFO, Antoine Tronquoy. I am also joined by Marie-Andree Boutin, EVP, Retail and Development; and Michael Racine, EVP, Leasing Office and Industrial.",
         "As you know, we had made noticeable progress in prior quarters fueled by the contribution of many of our transformation efforts and initiatives, and 2020 started with a strong first quarter. For Q2 there is no doubt that the impact of COVID-19 was strongly felt.",
         "On page three, please let me run you through our Q2 2020 highlights. For Q2 we experienced an organic decrease of 14.8% in same property NOI and registered a $331 million negative fair value adjustment on the back of COVID-19, reflecting a 4.9% negative change in our IFRS values, a decrease of 12% with respect to our enclosed malls. This negative fair value adjustment brought our leverage to 54.5%, up from 51.3% for Q1. Despite this turmoil, we enjoyed a 12.7% increase in rental rates on renewals and our liquidity remains healthy at $434 million when compared to upcoming maturity.",
         "Moving on to page four, a rapid timeline overview provides useful additional color. In Qu\u00e9bec, the pandemic was declared mid-March and office workers shifted to work-from-home mode at the same time.",
         "Shopping centers, which weighed heavily at Cominar were closed from March 22nd until June 1, except for the Montreal and Laval regions, where malls only reopened on June 19th. Mid-July the Qu\u00e9bec Government clarified that private sector employees whose -- employers whose employees were working from home can have up to 25% of their staff returned to work, while stating that the government continues to encourage work-from-home.",
         "From the get go, we deployed significant efforts to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations, including an assessment of the impacts on our clients and their risk profile through our asset segments and geographies.",
         "Throughout the period constant communication with our tenants and government authorities was also very much at the heart of our efforts. While seeking to maximize collections, we evaluated rent deferral requests on a case-by-case basis.",
         "We also chose to participate in the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program CECRA, which taking into account the federal and provincial government contributions totaling 62.5% of gross rent, have reduced eligible tenants rent contribution 25% and are lost at 12.5% of gross rent.",
         "Moving on to page five, we have collected to-date 75% of the total invoice rent for Q2, another 9% has to come from the federal and Qu\u00e9bec Government under CECRA. Tenants with whom we entered into an agreement owe us 7%, which can be split into 3% coming from rent deferrals, 3% amounting to the portion payable on reduced rents and 1% pertaining to the 25% portion of the rent that CECRA eligible tenants still have to pay.",
         "In total, 90% of total invoiced rent is contractually expected to be received. As the economy finds its footing, our collections today for August are ahead of July as of same day. The trend is clearly improving.",
         "To-date, we have identified credit losses for 6% of total invoice rent or $11.4 million. We have taken an additional provision for credit losses of 5% of total invoice rent or $6.8 million, bringing the total expected credit loss including provisions to 11% of total invoice rent or $18.2 million. This amount evidences our conservative approach but also sheds light on some weaker or less resilient tenants that we expect to replace with stronger covenants at higher rent levels, especially in the Industrial segment.",
         "In the Retail segment, our continuing focus is on increasing the component of essential service tenants and other performing Retail segments, and decreasing our exposure to fashion as we had commenced last year as part of our strategic plan initiatives.",
         "On page six, you will find further color on our Q2 collections by segment, 94% of total invoice rent was collected in the Office segment, 46% in Retail and 89% in Industrial. The Retail segment has the highest proportion of CECRA eligible tenants at 33%, followed by Industrial at 7% and Office at 3%. In essence, we are talking about approximately 1,000 applications, of which approximately 800 are in Retail.",
         "Turning to page seven, more specifically, with respect to the 30% -- 46% collection rate in Retail, our collection rate was 43% for enclosed malls and 55% for the rest of the Retail portfolio.",
         "On page eight, the same property NOI decreased a 14.8% was largely driven by the 41.8% decline in same property NOI in Retail, which came from a combination of reduced revenues 9.5% and increased expenses due to COVID-19 21.1%, including $17 million of expected credit losses.",
         "Office same property NOI increased by 0.4% as a consequence of a 3.9% reduction in revenues mitigated by an 8.1% decrease in expenses. Industrial same property NOI declined by 1.3%, further to a 2.3% decline in revenues, only partially offset by a 3.6% decline in expenses.",
         "Year-to-date, the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on our Retail assets drove same property NOI to a 5.7% decrease for our overall portfolio, while the Retail segment was negative by 21.6% year-to-date, it is worth mentioning that our Office and Industrial segments experienced positive same property NOI growth of 3.5% and 2.3%, respectively.",
         "Moving on to page nine, our committed occupancy and in-place occupancy rates are respectively slightly above and at our historical average and the recent decline of in-place occupancy comes from the Retail and the Industrial segment, which declined by 2% and 10.7%, respectively, since Q4 2019, while the Office segment increased by 1.1% over the same period. The Industrial market remains strong in Montreal and we see opportunities here on a go-forward basis and we fully intend to emphasize this asset class.",
         "On page 10, we continue to experience positive momentum in leasing activities in all of our assets segments. We use leases over the first six months of the year average the net increase of 12.7% when compared to in-place rents prior to renewals.",
         "All of our segments had positive leasing spreads, led by the Industrial segment at 22.3%, evidencing the strong momentum of the Industrial market, followed by the Office segment at 7.9% and the Retail segment at 1.8%.",
         "The Office segment performed well in multiple fronts. Firstly, same property NOI was up by 10.9% for the first half of the year for the Montreal Suburbs. In addition, the in-place occupancy rate grew by 2.4% for the Montreal Office sector and by 2.9% for the Montreal Suburban Office sector. Close to 110% of our Montreal Office leasable area maturing since the beginning of 2020 has been renewed or is covered by a new lease. Lastly, approximately 700,000 square feet or 44% of the leasable area maturing in 2021, with federal or provincial governments are already renewed are well advanced.",
         "In Retail, noteworthy post-quarter, as malls reopened, may not open with great success and fanfare, a 40,000 square foot grocery store at Mail Champlain and IGA recently opened its long awaited 35,000 square foot grocery store at Rockland. In addition as quickly as we lost our 50,000 square foot plus fortunate store at South Laval, we are at least with a desirable tenant for the totality of the space.",
         "With respect to our Sears efforts COVID-19 has brought some additional delays, I expect two quarters. But so far the key elements of our backfill pipeline remain intact. Our recent efforts to rebalance our tenant mix has resulted in an increase in essential services which now stands at 28% and a decrease in fashion exposure, which now stands at 32% for enclosed malls, declining by approximately 5% over the last two years.",
         "Obvious to say, although, Retail is far from easing, there are some good things happening. At certain of our larger Retail centers, we continue to work on creating additional value through densification initiatives and discussions with municipal authorities. The most advanced project [inaudible] Laval followed by Mail Champlain in Rockland. With respect to guest on time, we will be setting and formalizing our path as quickly as possible as post-COVID market conditions evolve.",
         "As we looked at our three asset segments going forward, we foresee emphasizing the Industrial segment which remains solid with the very favorable outlook and reducing our Retail exposure over time and as rapidly as possible that there is a window.",
         "With respect to our Retail segment, we are looking at all options for each of our Retail assets, and as we have previously mentioned, there is an unsurfaced value in potential densification opportunities, which raises the profile and interests for certain properties on the South Shore of Montreal and in Laval. And as mentioned, we are working for zoning variance in Rockland.",
         "Moving on to page 11, in order to maintain our financial flexibility, withstand volatility associated with the pandemic, which is lingering and to better enable us to invest in development projects, we have decided to reduce the distribution by 50% down $0.03 per unit on a monthly basis or $0.36 per unit on an annual basis. This distribution cut translates into an annual cash savings of $66 million, which is roughly equivalent to 1% of debt-to-gross book value. This financial flexibility will put less pressure on our leverage and will also be mean to finance development projects including in the Industrial sector.",
         "On page 12, we have $245 million of properties held for sale as at June 30. This includes a major Office property located in Downtown Montreal which is currently under contract. This transaction is expected to close by the end of the third quarter at a net sales price, net of transaction costs and yield maintenance slightly higher than our IFRS values.",
         "Antoine will now discuss our financials.",
         "Thank you, Antoine. Based on our estimates, we expect continued headwinds in the Retail segment in Q3, as the effect the tenant support initiatives on our part and greater percentage wherein dependency will be felt. However, we expect mortgage to wrap up in the following quarters.",
         "On the positive side, in our enclosed mall, in an urban environment we estimate foot traffic to be essentially at 70% of pre-COVID numbers, with sales being estimated at 15% off. Our foot traffic is closer to pre-COVID at regions and sales are doing better at 8% off. The performance in region is attributable to our centers being the dominant place for shopping and in older community, that\u2019s use towards e-commerce.",
         "In Retail, we are also seeing very strong sales in essential services, sports and leisure, and value Retail. Once again, we have been working closely with and supporting our Retail clients constructively and in an open dialog. And we firmly believe that our partnership approach will be rewarded and result in a stronger tenancy base in the mid- to long-term.",
         "In Industrial and Office, we estimate that we have essentially bottomed up that. In the Industrial segment, we continue to predict protect strong growth going forward. Once again this market remains very, very strong especially in Montr\u00e9al and we really like this segment, which we intent to fully emphasize going forward.",
         "On behalf of management, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees, as well as our trustees for their contribution in the context of this more special environment.",
         "I will now turn the mic over to the Operator for the question period. Thank you once again for taking part in this conference call and wish you all a nice day."

So the numbers you have are for Q2 committed occupancy. So it does include the stores that have closed in Q2 but there\u2019s very few, I think, there\u2019s only two."

So how much of that is either rent abatement or CECRA funds. And how much of that is revenue that\u2019s now vacancy that where you don\u2019t expect the NOI to come back for the quarter?"

So the 11% credit losses is a 5% provision and 6% coming from a combination of CECRA and rent reduction."

We recorded on -- at June 30th a lot of this sort of the pre-COVID type of negotiations. But if we are trying to isolate our discussions, our trend as at April 1 going forward, we are seeing some pretty interesting things, like, on Office lease renewal our step-ups are at the range of 5%, Industrial 20% and Retail in a more limited sampling of about 150,000 square feet, where, like, a here below 5%. So, there is a little bit of slippage on the committed occupancy side, but on these lease renewal rates, there\u2019s still a healthy backdrop. So we find that very, very interesting."

So even thought that we see reopening of the malls being positive, we have been supporting our good retailers who went through sort of a credit analysis and a business analysis in our part so we did some discount and those retailers that we are supporting, they pretty good feel the brunt of that in Q3.",
            "So that could be percentage rent. For example, there was originally supposed to be a large tenant type of relief program and that program would have been a lot more lining-up rents with percentages and so we have been trying to help certain of our retailers in that sense.",

I expect Q3 to be -- look a bit like a Q2 or could be a bit -- little bit underneath Q2 on the Retail and also we are trying to work our way through all the CCAA filings.",
            "What\u2019s good about these filings is we -- and the Qu\u00e9bec Government has been very, very close to aid us market banks to certain Qu\u00e9bec retailers. We are confident that a lot of these retailers will emerge with a better balance sheet and as long as we are satisfied in our end with their merchandising strategy that forms part of the analysis we did and that\u2019s why it\u2019s great to have Marie-Andree as part of the team. She understands retailing. So we -- Q3 will be a little bit headwind oriented, but we will wrap up quickly going out into Q4 and into the New Year."

When your retailer has a GROC of 14% to 15%, then has the 30%, 35% GROCs in other mall, their main focus is to deal with the higher one."

            "And in Industrial, we -- if we -- we may be doing something deliberately on our side, we are going to try to knockout some of our lower default paying tenants, because we have an opportunity to create value in rental rate. So that becomes part not of a COVID reaction but more of a leasing strategy.",
            "And on the Office side, what I can tell you is that we have -- so far in discussions we have very limited space seen -- seen limited space now coming back to us or in a sublease market, so we are in manageable numbers.",
            "So -- and I think we -- as we exit COVID, there\u2019s good things we can do in the Industrial segment. The Industrial market in Montreal remains very, very strong, okay. If you go through the data and you can see from CBRE and alike, it\u2019s a very good market and our numbers are lined up with what they are saying. So we feel good about that. And we have some real value opportunities we can do in that.",
            "That rental base I am talking about, these are tenants coming off of 5.55 a quarter, five, three quarters rent and market rent upwards of 7. So we can migrate and create value here. Our problem is not the asset, it -- we have got to be very careful and the government in Qu\u00e9bec has draft anti-eviction legislation on the table, it got eight, the national assembly closed down, because they made that legislation part of the construction bill, the infrastructure construction bill, but I expect that legislation to come back in the fall. So we try to move as efficiently as we can through that segment.",
            "And when we look at the step-up, I mentioned to you, while we are heading on renewals, so we are seeing good indicators. So I will be very cautious how we migrate from Q3 to Q4. But our approach this time is try to maximize rents collections, at the same time work with our partners to make sure that we are doing the right thing for us in the short-, medium- and long-term. Squeezing someone in the short-term and putting the company at risk in medium- to long-term we got to be mindful of that. So we have been very, very careful on how we manage."

Again, I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s translating in terms of rent collections and when it will translate.

            "And the rest don\u2019t forget that, yes, we collected 46% in the Retail, but we have negotiated for about 35% of deferral and repayment for the month of April, May and June and all of those credits are getting documented now. So we expect this number to move up over the course of the next few months, as deals get documented and tenants are paying what they owe for those months.",
            "So there is many, for example, there\u2019s many tenants, which whom we have negotiated, let\u2019s say, a certain percentage for April, a certain percentage May and call it, a much higher percentage for June and we still expect to receive those and it represents about 35% or so."

Some of those leases are completed, like, the one in [inaudible] in South Laval, which is a large space and we have a few other retailers that are in categories that we are looking for. One example is the extension of drug stores that are going on.",

The ones that have been are basically looking at their business right now, monitoring their recovery rate and assessing what they are going to be able to spend in CapEx on new venues.",

So it\u2019s a balance we have to play. We don\u2019t want to give the house away, because it\u2019s a difficult time. So we are balancing all of this."

I would suspect if there\u2019s a lot of investors out there that are probably looking to do the same, so that will be reflected in kind of the required rate of return and differential between the asset classes. So the distribution reduction, like, we hope in that regard, in terms of introducing financial flexibility. But when we think about where the balance sheet is today, how do you, kind of longer term go about executing on this repositioning while at the same time reducing leverage?"

When I look at the financial flexibility that we have going forward through the distribution cut, our leverage still remains high and it will be $66 million if you would have to equate, it\u2019s about 1% of debt reduction if you put nothing spent elsewhere.",
            "And in terms of the Retail exposure, as I mentioned, we are going to keep all options open. We have been doing a lot of work around improving the densification profile of an asset and there\u2019s value there and that increases or enhances the buyer interest in the profile of the asset. But as we speak today, the market as you know is shutdown.",
            "So the path to your question really comes from a sequence at which the market reopens and we are not going to destroy value and just do fire sales, but we are going to try to do this in a very structured and appropriate manner, and also measure what the cost of selling an asset is versus retaining it.",
            "So these are all the matters we are going through, but it all hinges upon buyer interest. And we think that we are -- there\u2019s things we can do to move that process along.
