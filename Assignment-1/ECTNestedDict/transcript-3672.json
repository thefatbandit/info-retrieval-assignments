      "Chris Lopez": [
         "Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today during what continues to be an extraordinary time. I hope you and your families are and will continue to be safe and well.",
         "Ontario recently entered Stage 3 of the province\u2019s three-stage reopening plan in which mostly businesses and public spaces have reopened with requirements to follow public health advice and workplace safety guidelines. We continue to remain optimistic that together, we will find a solution that will allow everyone to move forward with a new normal way of life in the not-too-distant future.",
         "In terms of our financial results for the quarter, we saw an increase in basic earnings per share to $1.84 compared to $0.26 last year. Adjusting for the Ontario Divisional Court\u2019s decision regarding the deferred tax asset on which I will elaborate later in a call, the adjusted earnings per share was $0.39 compared to $0.26 last year.",
         "In addition to hotter weather positively affecting peak demand, there were a number of favorable events this quarter that have contributed to the higher adjusted earnings. In April, we received the 2020 to 2022 transmission rate decision, which included one-time items such as, the recognition of revenues related to prior year conservation and demand management as well as transmission revenues related to the first quarter.",
         "Despite the management\u2019s high reported OM&A number, we saw a positive contribution from OM&A to earnings this quarter. Excluding the other post-employment benefits, which are recovered in revenue and therefore net income neutral, OM&A costs were lower despite additional COVID-19 related expenses. I am pleased with these results, which is a testament to the resiliency of our employees, our continued commitment to reducing costs for our customers and the fundamentals of the underlying business.",
         "Our second quarter revenue net of purchase power was high year-over-year by 13.4%. As mentioned, the primary driver of the increase was the hotter weather this quarter resulting in higher average monthly Ontario 60-minute peak demand.",
         "While COVID-19 and milder weather had negatively impacted peak demand in April, we saw substantially hotter weather in May and June with the year-over-year peak demand up 23% in May and 5% in June.",
         "This stable weather pattern resulted in a year-over-year quarterly increase in peak demand of approximately 5%. We continue to see the hotter weather translate into higher peak demand in July as the year-over-year peak demand increased by approximately 12%.",
         "In addition, the transmission decision included revenues related to changes in approved rates. The recognition of other post-employment benefits that were previously capitalized and one-time items, such as catch-up revenue for the first quarter which is recognized this quarter and the disposition of balances from the regulatory deferral and variance accounts not previously recognized. Distribution revenues net of purchase power were also higher by 4.5%, driven by approved rates as well as higher energy consumption in the quarter.",
         "Turning to operating expenditures. Reported OM&A was higher by 1.1% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, included in the transmission decision was the requirement to recognize other post-employment benefits as both the cost and the revenue item, and therefore net income neutral rather than capitalizing and amortizing it. Adjusting for this, we saw a margin decrease in OM&A year-over-year, despite the additional COVID-19 related costs.",
         "In response to the pandemic, we prioritized essential and high priority work and deferred other work in April and May. We expect to complete the deferred work programs within the year as our teams return to full complement at the beginning of June. On an ongoing basis, I am pleased with our continued efforts to reduce cost for our customers and highlight the lower corporate support costs this quarter.",
         "Consistent with the first quarter call, the impact of the measures taken by Hydro One to support our customers, including the Pandemic Relief Fund, financial assistance and increased payment flexibility, extending the Winter Relief Program and the temporary suspension of late fees are not expected to be material.",
         "We continue to incur higher operating expenses in the quarter of approximately 23 million related to COVID-19. This includes the temporary stand down of casual workforce and the purchase of additional facility and cleaning-related supplies. The cost of COVID-19 on a year-to-date basis and excluding any impact from load now total approximately $46 million, which includes a $40 million allowance for bad debts which has been deferred.",
         "We continue to track the impact of COVID-19 as directed by the OEB. The OEB has recently initiated a consultation process on the deferral accounts relating to the impacts arising through COVID-19. The consultation will assist the OEB in the development of appropriate accounting guidance as it assesses the policy direction with respect to the amounts tracked and establishes the timing and process for disposition. The consultation process will likely conclude in late 2020 or early 2021. As such, we expect to receive definitive guidance on the COVID-19 tracking and deferral accounts in late 2020 or early 2021.",
         "On financing, we saw a slight increase in interest expense due to a higher weighted average long-term debt balance as a result of the $1.1 billion debt issuance in the first quarter of 2020. As a reminder, this issuance was completed at some of the most competitive rates achieved by our Canadian issuer. We remain very pleased with our strong balance sheet and robust investment grade credit ratings.",
         "The income tax recovery was 849 million for the second quarter compared to 6 million last year. The increase in income tax recovery was primarily attributable to the Ontario Divisional Court decision issued on July 16.",
         "We set aside the OEB ruling on the deferred tax asset. As a reminder, the deferred tax asset had resulted from Hydro One's initial public offering and its transition from the payment in lieu of tax regime under the Electricity Act to tax payments under the federal and provincial tax regimes.",
         "While the Ontario Divisional Court decision concluded that it did not have the authority to substitute its own decision for that of the OEB, the court\u2019s order returned the matter to the OEB with clear directions. While the decision was received in July, it was a subsequent event that required adjustments in the financial statements.",
         "As such, we have reversed the one-time charges taken at the end of 2018 and recognized an income tax recovery that has a one-time net income impact of 867 million. Although a one-time item, it will result in average annual increase in FFO in the range of $50 million to $60 million per year once the OEB has determined the path forward.",
         "Due to the reasons discussed earlier, the effective tax rate this quarter was negative 326.5% versus negative 3.9% last year. Adjusting for the income tax recovery, our effective tax rate would have been 6.9% which is consistent with our previous guidance of 6% to 13%. In the near term, our effective tax rate guidance is not expected to change. We will update these further once the OEB has determined the path forward.",
         "Moving onto investing activities, the company placed $165 million of assets in service in the second quarter, a 40.2% decrease to the prior year. This was largely the result of hiring and servicing of sustained investments at several transmission stations last year, and lower volume of overhead lines and component replacements in the second quarter of this year. We also in-serviced a substantial portion of the development project at Brant transmission station in the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Capital investment for the second quarter was 429 million, which is a 15.9% increase from the second quarter in 2019. The increase was mainly due to higher investments in multiyear development projects for the transmission business, the construction of a new Ontario grid control center in Orillia, investments in distribution system connections and modernization initiatives and a higher volume of new customer connections and storm-related asset replacements.",
         "Our crews have been able to do an outstanding job on execution of the capital program and in-servicing of projects, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. We continue to recover from the impact that COVID-19 has had on our ability to in-service projects in the quarter, and we\u2019ll make best efforts for a full recovery in the latter part of 2020.",
         "As promised in our first quarter call, we have updated the future capital investment forecast to reflect the changes arising from the transmission decision as well as the Peterborough acquisition. The table will be updated next quarter with the expected closing of the Orillia acquisition. The changes do not materially impact our long-term capital investment growth rate or our long-term rate base growth.",
         "Productivity savings of 86 million in the second quarter represents a 61.7% increase year-over-year. Productivity improvements were a result of ongoing work and labor force efficiency and the previous rollout of technology solutions in the forestry, corporate and customer service areas.",
         "While we deferred some work program with larger work crews to later in the year, the pandemic provided a unique opportunity to accelerate work that used technology more effectively and was safer to execute in the socially distant manner. This resulted in higher productivity being realized in the quarter. For the remainder of the year, we do not expect the same run rate as experienced this quarter as we revert back to the cadence of our regular work program.",
         "Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on July 16, we received the final rate order from the OEB on our 2020 to 2022 transmission rate decision. The exact OEB accepted Hydro One\u2019s proposed reductions to in-service additions included in the draft rate order. As a reminder, since the capital reductions were predominately in the sustainment category, we expect the deferred portion of capital to be deployed in our next rate application.",
         "As Mark mentioned, we were pleased that the OEB agreed to defer the implementation of approved rates in support of our customers. While there is no impact to net income, collection of our 2020 foregone revenue will be determined in a future decision from the OEB.",
         "On the acquisition front, I am pleased that we successfully completed the purchase of the business and distribution assets of Peterborough Distribution from the City of Peterborough on August 1. We also continue to make good progress and expect to close the acquisition of Orillia Power Distribution Corporation from the City of Orillia in the third quarter of this year.",
         "Finally, at this time, we do not see a change to the guidance we issued at our Investor Day and reaffirmed in last quarter\u2019s call. While due to COVID-19 we have prioritized near-term capital delivery to work that is essential, we are confident that we will complete the capital program as committed over the rate period.",
         "Further, considering the effects of COVID-19 and the recent decision on the 2020 to 2022 transmission rate application, the approval of the Orillia and Peterborough acquisitions, we continue to be committed to and affirm our guidance of 4% to 7% earnings per share growth through 2022. ",
         "I\u2019ll stop there and we\u2019ll be pleased to take your questions."
      ],
      "Mark Poweska": [
         "Thank you, Omar. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today to review our second quarter results. I hope you\u2019re healthy and staying safe during this time. Today\u2019s update will focus on our sustainability achievements and path forward to building a more diverse and inclusive company.",
         "The second stage of our operations as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and our Q2 financial results; as the world continues to grapple with the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic, we've also seen social movements around the world. We all share responsibility in confronting racism.",
         "Our organization is on a collective journey to better understand the experiences of black and indigenous employees with systemic racism and bias in order to create an inclusive environment. Recently, I joined other Canadian CEOs in signing the pledge to the Black North initiative. For us, this means committing to seven goals to move Canada toward ending anti-Black racism and creating opportunities for underrepresented groups.",
         "As Ontario's largest electricity transmission and distribution company, we recognize the impact we have in developing meaningful long-term change in our society. The events of this year have also put a spotlight on the collective responsibility that governments, companies and individuals share in building a more sustainable world. Corporations will be evaluated on how they adapt and actions they take today.",
         "As part of our corporate strategy, I prioritized a focus on environmental, social and governance issues. Why? Because our long-term performance depends on incorporating sustainability into all aspects of our business. Our stakeholders told us they expect an unwavering commitment to exceptional customer service, safety, efficiency and sustainability. They want us to look out for future generations.",
         "By becoming a more sustainable company, we can help create a better and brighter future for all. We are pleased that our efforts are being recognized as we recently secured a spot in Corporate Knights\u2019 2020 list of Canada's 50 Best Corporate Citizens and ranked fourth amongst the global list of 143 utilities.",
         "This morning, we released our 2019 Sustainability Report, solidifying our leadership in environmental, social and governance issues. Some highlights include, on the environmental front, our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint by converting 50% of our fleet of sedans and SUVs to electrical vehicles or hybrids by 2025. In addition, our significant savings as a result of our recycling program.",
         "On social, 2019 saw our highest ever indigenous spend. Our recent achievements of Catalyst court commitments on gender diversity, including 50-50 gender diversity on our Board and our commitment to develop diversity hiring goals. On governance, our use of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework and the global reporting initiative core Sustainability Reporting Standards.",
         "We are also aiming to adhere to the taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures in the near future to secure transparent disclosures and drive the consistency of our sustainability performance data. The social elements of sustainability are vital right now in determining how we all emerge from this uncertain period.",
         "To me, the social element needs ensuring the health and safety of employees and the public. It means affordability for our customers, removing racism and building an inclusive culture, all while adapting our business model and helping to restart the economy.",
         "As an essential business, we have played a critical role in energizing life in the province during the COVID-19 pandemic and we will continue to play a critical role in rebuilding the economy. We continue to do everything we can to protect our employees and stand up for customers and communities.",
         "We weathered a number of storms, including one in June, where we safely restored power to 200,000 customers. Our hardworking crews demonstrated that we are still able to restore power just as quickly and just as safely as they were prior to the pandemic. Project work and capital deployment has ramped back up. And as of the beginning of June, our fieldwork is back to normal levels.",
         "We now anticipate we will complete most of our work programs by the end of the year or in the beginning of 2021. We still have more than 3,000 office staff that are working from home. Our cautious, measured and safe approach to returning staff back into the office setting is working, and throughout the pandemic we have not had any workplace transmissions of COVID-19.",
         "Consistent with our staged approach, the first stage is a return of up to 10% of our office staff into an office, concentrating on employees requiring access to special equipment to perform their job effectively. In the long term, we are engaging with our employees on our work-from-home strategy.",
         "We continue to monitor our network and systems very closely during this pandemic. This has been a very hot summer and we've experienced higher usage peaks and much higher than last year. Our electricity system is prepared for this and we continue to monitor our grid to provide safe and reliable power to our customers.",
         "We believe we have a great responsibility to support our customers through the pandemic, especially those who are struggling with affordability. We continue to offer financial assistance to residential customers through our Pandemic Relief Program and we've returned $5 million in security deposits to over 4,000 eligible business customers. We\u2019ve also extended our ban on disconnections for residential customers during this time.",
         "Our community investment strategy has been focused on the most pressing needs facing our communities. We\u2019ve partnered with GlobalMedic and the M\u00e9tis Nation of Ontario to provide food and supplies to our indigenous customers and communities. We also provided funding to feed Ontario, which provides supplies to food banks across the province.",
         "By being more in tune with the needs of our customers, we've been successful in advocating for more measures to provide customer relief. The government introduced COVID-19 recovery rate which put a pause on peak pricing and introduced flexible electricity pricing until October 31, 2020, and introduced the COVID-19 Energy Assistance Program. As we continue to navigate the pandemic, our strong foundations have resulted in a proven ability to adapt.",
         "Now, we will look at how the electricity sector can support economic recovery in the province? A safe, reliable transmission system is fundamental to supporting economic growth and jobs. This quarter, we moved forward on two large transmission projects.",
         "First, we continued our engagement process to build a new transmission line from Chatham to Lakeshore to support the greenhouse industry, otherwise known as Leamington line. We were pleased with the record attendance of 4,000 people during our virtual community information session, which illustrates the impactful nature of the project.",
         "Second, we launched community engagement for the Waasigan Transmission Line, which is the first step in the environmental assessment process. This transmission line will increase the amount of electricity that can flow through the system in Northwestern Ontario, providing local businesses and communities with the electricity they need to grow. These two projects are examples of how we continue to add value and support economic growth in Ontario.",
         "We are also doing our part to drive costs out of the system, benefit of our customers and shareholders. We've realized $86 million in productivity savings this quarter as the pandemic provided an opportunity for us to accelerate work that use technology more effectively and was safer to execute in a socially distant manner. Chris will speak more to this later.",
         "In April, we received a decision from the Ontario Energy Board on the company's 2020 to '22 Transmission Rate Application, demonstrating Ontario's constructive regulatory environment. In its decision, the OEB approved approximately $3.4 billion of capital expenditures, which will allow us to make the necessary investments required for a safe and reliable electricity system.",
         "In order to advocate for more flexibility and relief for our customers, we asked the OEB to defer implementation of the approved rate which they have supported. By doing this, we are able to eliminate any increases to the transmission portion of the bill in 2020 at a time when relief is needed more than ever. We are pleased with their decision to allow rate deferral, so we can minimize any further adverse customer impact. The OEB will determine the collection period for our foregone revenue in a future decision.",
         "Last month, we received a decision on our appeal to the Ontario Divisional Court regarding the OEB\u2019s decision on the deferred tax asset. The Ontario Divisional Court set aside the decision of the OEB and ordered that the matter be returned to the OEB to correct the errors identified, and make the appropriate tax savings allocations. We are awaiting next steps from the Ontario Energy Board, but are pleased that the OEB did not appeal the decision at the Ontario Divisional Court. Chris will go into further depth of both the impact of this ruling on our financials.",
         "We are further pleased with the path the government is taking on the implementation of OEB\u2019s new governance structure. The recent leadership announcement strengthened the OEB and we welcome the new appointees and the returning members. We look forward to working on behalf of customers and all Ontarians in a period of constructive rate regulation under their leadership.",
         "In other updates, on August 1, we successfully completed the acquisition of the distribution and business assets of Peterborough Distribution and we look forward to completing the acquisition of Orillia Power shortly. We are pleased to have the privilege of serving both cities and their unique needs as they continue to see significant growth.",
         "I\u2019m happy to announce that we have reached a tentative three-year deal on two collective agreements with the Power Workers\u2019 Union, which represents 3,800 regular employees and approximately 1,400 casual employees in critical frontline roles across the company operations in Ontario. Union members will now vote on these tentative agreements with the outcomes anticipated in September and October. ",
         "Our Chief Human Resources Officer, Saylor Millitz-Lee, will be retiring this fall. Saylor has been a trusted member of my executive leadership team, a visible advocate for our employees and has been instrumental in leading our human resources transformation journey.",
         "I\u2019d like to welcome Stacey Mowbray to the Hydro One Board of Directors. We all will benefit from her strong track record in leading successful publicly traded consumer brands, and I look forward to working with her. With her appointment, our non-executive board maintains the ratio of 50% women and 50% men, which is a testament to our values.",
         "In closing, the last few quarters have been positive for Hydro One. We are successfully executing the strategy that was released last year in November and these efforts are bearing fruit. Our relationships with our partners and stakeholders have strengthened. We've received multiple favorable rulings from the legal and regulatory bodies. We've reached tentative agreements with our unions. And our customer satisfaction is higher than before. Hydro One is on a stable and secure path towards long-term success.",
         "Over to you, Chris."

         "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us in Hydro One\u2019s second virtual earnings call. Joining us today are our President and CEO, Mark Poweska; and our Chief Financial Officer, Christopher Lopez.",
         "In the call today, we will go over our second quarter results and then spend the majority of the call answering as many of your questions as time permits. There are also several slides that illustrate some of the points we'll address in a moment. This should be up on the webcast now or if you\u2019re dialed into the call, you can also find them on Hydro One's Web site in the Investor Relations section under Events & Presentations. We also released our 2019 Sustainability Report this morning which should be up on the Web site as well. ",
         "Today's discussions will likely touch on estimates and other forward-looking information. You should review the cautionary language in today's earnings release and our MD&A, which we have filed this morning regarding the various factors, assumptions and risks that could cause our actual results to differ as they all apply to this call.",
         "With that, I turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mark Poweska.",
         "Thank you, Mark and Chris. We\u2019ll ask Shannon to explain how she'd like to organize the Q&A polling process. In case we aren\u2019t able to address your questions today, my team and I are always available to respond to follow-up questions. Please go ahead, Shannon."

You have \u2013 the CapEx number is also moving a bit lower here because of this decision. I was wondering if you can update us on \u2013 to any extent the new rate base CAGR that you\u2019re expecting over the next five years and with the lower CapEx, and what are you guys seeing in terms of offsets there to keep you within that guidance range."

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. So I think the last comment I had in my opening remarks was that we reaffirmed our 4% to 7% EPS growth over that time, so we\u2019re still very comfortable that the rate base CAGR is in the upper 4s. So yes, we did reduce it but it was very marginal, the reduction that you just saw that was put through. It was the net impact of the transmission rate case which is roughly a 10% reduction in capital expenditure, but still approval of 90% being more than $3.4 billion of CapEx over the next three years. And then secondly, we updated for the acquisition of Peterborough. So in short, we\u2019re very confident in the upper 4s just on rate base growth. And then you add on any of the other growth that we get out of potentially over earning and our unregulated business, which is a small part."

And I\u2019m not sure how much more detail you can provide on some of the trends you\u2019re seeing in volumes, the data \u2013 you see July up also quite a bit, but it is quite interesting to see volumes move up quite a bit during COVID-19. So is there any way to normalize some of this demand for weather conditions you\u2019re seeing? And is there anything, maybe just high level you\u2019re seeing in terms of your customer mix and what\u2019s been occurring within each of the customer classes on demand?"

            "Ben, it\u2019s Mark here. I\u2019ll maybe start with that and Chris if you want to add in, you go ahead. There was a recent call with IESO, a stakeholder engagement meeting when they really talked about what they\u2019re seeing across the province for loads between the different customer classes. So on the residential side, we\u2019re actually seeing about a 10% to 15% increase in daily peak volumes during these heat waves relative to pre-COVID demand. So on the residential, the heat has really had an impact on the loads. For small commercial, daily peak and energy reductions of about 4% compared to pre-COVID period. And then for the large commercial and industrial, we\u2019re seeing recent increases in consumption since Stage 2 reopening. However, the demand for this segment is still slightly below the pre-COVID levels. So to summarize really, our residential loads are increasing, obviously a lot driven by the fact that people are working from home, a lot of people and the heat. Small commercial, slight decrease in consumption there which as the economy reopens we expect that to start to recover. And the same thing with the large commercial and industrial, but have seen a demand increase in that quicker as Stage 2 is reopening."

      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I\u2019ll just add a couple of comments. I think you\u2019re correct. We did see in July another increase \u2013 this is all publicly available information from the IESO. So peak load was up 12% to 15% for the month of July and we\u2019ve seen a very strong start to August. So it is a trend that\u2019s continued. No doubt the warmer weather has added to that, but I think the underlying shift from where we consume our power hasn\u2019t been as \u2013 I think some of the assumptions early on that we saw from other countries was that load will drop 10%. We simply haven\u2019t seen that. So Dx load for the last quarter or Q2 was up 2.4%, so that\u2019s energy consumption. And then Tx peaked, which drives our transmission business was up 5%. And I think I gave guidance on last quarter\u2019s call that said \u2013 if it\u2019s based on other countries\u2019 experiences, we would have seen a 10% reduction. So it\u2019s quite an increase. Part of this is no doubt due to weather but the other part is I don\u2019t think we\u2019re being affected in the same way other countries were with COVID-19. The IESO also commented on as we\u2019re coming into Stage 3 with more businesses opening, we should see any of those potential impacts of COVID-19 start to be relieved. So the combination of a strong weather pattern and COVID-19 sort of starting to normalize, we should see that continuing effect we had in July and August."

            "Absolutely. Julien, thanks for the question and good to hear from you again. Overall, what we\u2019ve done so far is we\u2019ve received the decision that says \u2013 the Divisional Court that says, look, the money will be returned to shareholders based on that decision. So that\u2019s 867 million. The next phase of this is the court will issue an order, so the time has expired for an appeal and the court will now issue an order that is very specific to the OEB. The OEB will go through a process to confirm that they\u2019ve corrected. And then there will be a process by which we work out when they get put in rates. There are a number of options there that could ask for an update to a rate order that\u2019s in place today or possibly the more likely scenario would be to ask us to consider the return of the DTA at the next rate order, and that could be as late as 2022 going into '23. So that could be the next period for this. So it\u2019s uncertain, Julien, of exactly when we\u2019re going to start to see the cash flow benefit there. I would say it would be no later than '23 on, which is the next rate case. It could be sooner but that would depend on the OEB process. As for what we would do with that, the benefits will be 50 million to 60 million near term. So when we say near term, that\u2019s the average run rate of the DTA going forward. But recall that we\u2019ve already been sharing the benefits with existing rate payers today. So by the end of 2022, that could be as high as 300 million as it stands today, so approximately 150 million. So if you add that on, that could increase the DTA cash flow benefit for a period of time up towards the $100 million mark. But the long-term projection is around $50 million to $60 million per year. Julien, as for what we do with that, it\u2019s probably too soon to call. It will depend on when we get it and when it starts coming through. But then clearly we\u2019d look at our position on FFO and that would put us in a much stronger position and give us more ability with our balance sheet. So we\u2019d have a look at that and determine that at that point."

Many of them are customers, so we\u2019re working to support them through COVID and do what we can do to help support that. What they might do with their local utilities in the future as a result of the impacts of COVID is still yet to be known. We obviously \u2013 if one is willing to divest their municipal assets, we would be interested in looking at those.

As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, really what we\u2019re trying to do with our productivity savings is essentially offset inflation, so that means about $50 million a year in productivity savings increases. And we saw a fairly good increase in our productivity savings in Q2, a lot of that driven by our ability to deploy technology which I think COVID helped to accelerate and our move to mobile with a lot of our forestry teams to iPads in their hands, dispatching crew resources using electronic means has really helped us. The other area that we saw improvements in Q2 is incremental customer service savings which came as a result of our call center in-sourcing and settlement of settlements which is another element of our call center which we brought back into the company. We\u2019re seeing savings as a result of that. As well on the capital front, we saw incremental fleet rationalization. We accelerated our overtime reduction in transmission stations and we saw increased wrench time in the move to mobile. So right across, we saw quite a bit of productivity improvement in Q2. The other area was we increased our procurement during Q2 as we stockpiled some resources to materials, like poles and transformers, which as a result of COVID has \u2013 we wanted to make sure we had enough stockpiles, so we got the incremental productivity savings as a result of improved volume wise."

So growing that business with new products has been a little more challenging in this period. So when you think about the longer term, it has been impacted slightly here in Q2 and Q3, but we think we can recover that. But the positive side is we\u2019ve seen a high demand for our services in regards to short-term telecommunication needs by corporates. So that has actually underpinned our profitability in that business quite a lot for this year. So we\u2019ve seen that and we\u2019re back on track there. In regards to the Ivy Charging Network, we continue to expand our partnership there with Ontario Power Generation, OPG, and it\u2019s going very well. We had started with fast charging units and now we\u2019re looking at some of the slower charging units that would be used in residential and sort of non-commercial uses. So that business continues to grow at a very good rate for us. The only thing I\u2019d remind you overall is that it\u2019s not a big component of our business. Remember, 99% of our earnings comes from regulated sources and that would continue to be the case for some time to come. But on the unregulated side, some of those things are presenting themselves quite well."

If the IESO directed us to build additional infrastructure as a result of economic stimulus, we would have to work for the IESO and the OEB on whether it would be incremental above our approved capital program or offset somewhere within. So I think it\u2019s pretty early on to determine what that might look like. We\u2019re really just putting forward opportunities for where we see there is load growth and the need for additional infrastructure, particularly in the Southwest. We\u2019re building one new line in infrastructure to feed the greenhouse industry down in the Southwest of Ontario, but we haven\u2019t even built that. It\u2019s fully subscribed by customers already and there\u2019s opportunity for more growth there as well as in the mining sector that we see that there\u2019s opportunity in the Northwest for mining and additional infrastructures for that. So early days. We\u2019re putting things forward that we think might be helpful. How that might be rolled into rates and into our capital program, we\u2019d have to follow all of that."

That\u2019s not clear to us yet even on the revenue side. It\u2019s how do you separate those things. So part of the consultation process will be to get some clarity on how each of the utilities in the province will capture and dissect those costs. And then at that point the consultation will turn to what might be appropriate for recovery in the future from the utilities. So again, pretty early on. We are in consultation. We aren\u2019t expecting really to get clarity on what it might look like until late 2020 or early 2021. So we\u2019ll continue to work with the others in the sector and the OEB through that and update you guys as we go along."

Bad debts have remained very flat. In fact, it\u2019s slightly down than last year. So we made the provision in Q1 for $14 million and we kept that. We did not change it. There\u2019s still a ways to go here in terms of COVID-19, so we\u2019ve kept that for now but we\u2019ve not seen an increase in bad debt from that period. In regards to cost, we did see an increase in this quarter of 23 million. That was primarily at the frontend of Q2. So the backend has really slowed down here, so we do not expect that run rate to continue. Now, again, if you end up with a second or third wave, that could change. But for now, we believe that those costs are going to remain increased incrementally from here but not at that rate. And then we\u2019re going to do everything we can to try and offset the cost as much as we can."

So I don\u2019t expect that same level of productivity we achieved this quarter to continue at that rate for the balance of the year. In the first half of the year, if you add up the statements from Q1 and Q2, we\u2019ve had quite an impact on productivity. So that\u2019s been a large source of the OM&A savings this year in Q2. So I would still expect us to \u2013 what you should see is COVID-19 costs sort of drop away now and then some of that work programs pick up, but I would expect that run rate to stay roughly similar. So that\u2019s probably the best way to look at it, Mark, is that \u2013 and I was hinting to that a second ago when we talked about our COVID-19 costs being heavily weighted to April and May."

We do have expectations about the OEB that we complete our work programs during the rate period which in this case for both Tx and Dx goes until 2022. So we do have flexibility within that rate period to advance and/or move work in and out of a particular year provided we achieve our overall objectives by the end of the rate period.

And when those costs are not there, we can accelerate some of the work program that we had for Q2 here. So we do have that flexibility.

First, whether it\u2019s operational just spending, your thoughts on Bill 171 and whether \u2013 or if you can quantify what you think the costs or the rate base impact to that would be? And then as it relates to rates, have your discussions ever moved or incorporated your thoughts on the generation mix and the cost of generation notwithstanding you don\u2019t have any, but that maybe positions you as a little bit more of an independent expert as it relates to just optimizing kind of the mix within the customer rate basket?"

Maybe I\u2019ll talk in general about interactions with government, focuses that I\u2019m seeing from government right now and probably no surprise to you that the government\u2019s really focused on the impacts of the pandemic and how they can support the electricity customers across a province. And so they\u2019ve taken several actions as a result of that, including holiday from the time of use rate fixing that, eliminating or freezing the industrial conservation initiative which is really targeted at not penalizing large industrials for using energy at peaks because the fact that we are energy long and capacity long right now and they don\u2019t want them to ramp back and slow down the economy by doing that. So they\u2019re trying to incent the use of energy to get the economy going. So there\u2019s a lot of things the government is looking at right now and we\u2019ve seen the actions they\u2019ve taken, which is really around supporting customers and restarting the economy. There hasn\u2019t been a lot of chatter lately around what they\u2019re doing with rates long term and what they want to with the global adjustment. But I suspect at some point they will turn to that. The Bill provides a mechanism by which utility companies may be required to move utility infrastructure if necessary for the transit. So we are working with the transit authorities to make sure that we\u2019re doing our part in order to not hold up the investments in the transit infrastructure, particularly in downtown Toronto. So the risk to utilities is that if utilities delay projects, some of the cost can be passed on to the utilities. So we\u2019re working very closely with Metrolinx and the ones that we\u2019re associated with to make sure that we\u2019re in lockstep with them, so that we don\u2019t have a risk of some of those costs being passed onto us."

And just for a reminder that\u2019s one \u2013 one is looking at the cost for us to make the billing changes. The other is looking at revenue and the third is looking at miscellaneous costs such as bad debt. So we will continue to work with the OEB on that. And as we get more clarity on how that will be calculated and what parts of that might be recoverable in the future, we will share that with you."

         "Remarks": [
            "Robert, I\u2019ll just classify some things there. So the 46 million that you\u2019re quoting, that\u2019s the sum total of what we\u2019ve tracked to date and reported to the OEB, and every utility is doing that by the way. So in that number there\u2019s $14 million of bad debt. So we\u2019ve deferred that essentially but that\u2019s related to non-recovery of revenues. And then the remaining part is mostly OM&A. So we had $5 million from Q1 which we reported in Q1 and $23 million in Q2. There was a small amount for lost revenue of $4 million, but a minor amount. So $28 million is the largest piece which is OM&A. And like I said, we do not expect that to continue to increase at the rate you saw in Q2. There might be some small flow through cost in Q3. Our first job is to minimize that as much as possible and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing to the extent we can offset, and then we need to look at the way that you calculate the net impact of the COVID-19. So part of it is the actual impact. But then there are some savings from potentially doing things differently. So how much of that gets inscribed to COVID-19? The ideal situation is if the industry could offset overall. But again, that will come through the consultation process and not every utility has the same ability to do that. Where we can do that, we\u2019d lead by example. But we\u2019re not expecting every utility to be in the same position that Hydro One is. The second part is we need to look at the impact on load given that we\u2019ve had a very positive weather impact. So how does that sort of get squared away with COVID-19? We\u2019ve not been reporting impacts on loads for COVID-19 even through the tracking accounts. We want to discuss that through the consultation process and ensure that we\u2019re all aligned. But that\u2019s going to affect transmitters as well as generators as well as distribution units. So we\u2019re going to take part in the consultation process that comes up. But right now our focus is on minimizing those costs as far as we can."

We are at some of the highest we\u2019ve seen in customer sat and a lot of that\u2019s driven by the support we\u2019ve been giving for customers and the improvements we\u2019ve made in our customer service both in the call center as well as in our connection processes. So we are seeing a good improvement, an increase. We\u2019re actually looking at how we can benchmark to other utilities across the sector both in Canada and the U.S. There isn\u2019t actually a good consistent way in which utilities measure customer satisfaction which we\u2019ve found so far. So we\u2019re working on what that might look like and we\u2019re also working through the Canadian Electrical Association to see if we can standardize that at least across the Canadian utilities so that we can know how we compare to others. The reasons why customers are satisfied with us so far is really kind of improvements in our time to reach power outages or improvements in reliability. The work we\u2019ve been doing for advocating for customers such as our relief measures for COVID as well as trusted partners. We\u2019ve been lobbying for or advocating for customers with things like off-peak time of use pricing and working with governments to provide some relief for customers. Areas we can improve so that we can drive up our customer even higher is improving our tree tailoring [ph] and maintenance efforts. So we\u2019ve been doing that through our [indiscernible] program, but we\u2019ll continue to do that. And obviously electricity prices, even though we\u2019re a small percentage of that, continues to be on the customer\u2019s mind. So I don\u2019t have a target yet, but we are looking at what is a good comparator way of consistently measuring customer satisfaction that we can compare to other utilities and we hope to have something this year on that."

So to maintain the current ratings we need to stay above 11% FFO to debt. We are comfortably above that at this moment in time. But benefits from the DTA decision won\u2019t be factored into our FFO to debt calculation until there is certainty around when the detail will be recovered through rates. So as I said, in one of the earlier questions \u2013 in response to one of the other questions is that could be as late as 2023. So it\u2019s too soon, Pat, to call what that dry powder is. We have enough flexibility in our balance sheet today to continue to acquire the smaller LDCs in Ontario and I think that\u2019s where we can deliver the most value in two, three, four, five years if we wanted to. So there is no restriction there. That\u2019s not a limiting factor for us. And any particular uptick from the DTA is still some time off, so it\u2019s too soon to give you a figure on just how much flexibility that will provide."

And then over on the ESG front as you look to establish more concrete targets this year such as GHG reductions, I know most of your emissions come from your vehicle fleet, but curious as you continue to switch certain customers over from propane to electricity, if that will count as a net reduction to your emissions? And I guess just maybe how material this switching opportunity might be for the company from a load standpoint say over the next five years?"

Right now, our GHG emissions, the main sources as you point out, one is our fleet, the other is we do have diesel generation for some of our non-integrated or off-grid facilities as well as SF6 gas which is an insulating gas we use in our equipment. Those are the three big areas that we\u2019re going to look to offset and set targets on, on how we can reduce those. Switching from propane to electricity because it\u2019s not included in our base GHG emissions right now, we\u2019ll have to determine on how we take credit for or if we take credit for the reduction in GHG as a result of that switch. Right now we\u2019re seeing a small uptick in our fuel switching program, so getting off of either fuel gases or oil-based heating or propane to electricity, I don\u2019t see it as a big part of future growth or big part of our GHG focus but it\u2019s something for us to think about, Patrick."

            "Hi, Mona. Thanks for the question. So I think \u2013 it really depends on a willing seller and a willing buyer. So we\u2019re definitely a willing buyer and we think we can bring the most benefit to those utilities that are within our service area today. So there\u2019s more in the remote locations that we can bring significant synergies there that will benefit customers in the long term, but also just let us take a fair price in the short term. I think it really does come down to that. And I think Mark answered the question previously around COVID-19 and the pressures they may be facing. Right now we know municipalities are focused more on helping the residents and ensuring safe and reliable power just like we do today. So we\u2019re really helping support them as we go forward today as a customer of ours. They\u2019re normally within our service territory. And then we can help them in any other way as we move forward. We stand willing and able to partner with any of them and we\u2019ll continue to be there. In terms of the opportunity that\u2019s left, there is around $9 billion of rate base left in the province that is not in the hands of say Hydro One or an Electro. It is a consolidation of smaller LDCs, the largest of which is Toronto Hydro. So if we exclude that, it\u2019s around $5 billion just under of smaller LDCs around the province ranging anywhere from tens of millions up to over the $1 billion mark or close to the $1 billion mark out of Ottawa. So they\u2019re all \u2013 we\u2019d be willing to speak to all of them. It\u2019s just the case of when does it make sense and how do we bring the most value to the municipality and the rate base. We did talk a little bit about our balance sheet. Our balance sheet can support a lot of these smaller rollouts if and when they occur. Right now for this year we\u2019re focused on closing Peterborough and Orillia. We just closed Peterborough here in August. Orillia will be in September in Q3. And we want those to be very successful acquisitions again to further demonstrate how we partner and benefit the communities in which we work and we supply power. So that\u2019s our focus going forward. There is no specific number, Mona, but there\u2019s around $4 billion of rate base that we think is available when the time is right."

With respect to the revenue beat \u2013 sorry, the strong year-over-year revenue I guess in Q2, you\u2019re attributing the majority I believe to the warmer weather, but would it be more accurate to call it a warmer weather plus the combination of load shift to residential?"

Definitely we\u2019ve seen a shift based on behaviors and COVID\u2019s brought some of that on, meaning more people working from home yet offices still being open. Hotter weather had an impact on that and drove the peak demand overall, so we did see that. The overall consumption is how much energy our customers use and the customers of the other LDCs use is dependent on the sectors I talked about before, whether that be residential, commercial or industrial. It\u2019s a different story for each of them. So I think dissecting as I said before what are the impacts of COVID versus what are the impacts of the hotter weather and how do you separate those out is something that we\u2019ll work through with the other utilities as well as the OEB going forward. Chris, do you want to add to that at all?"

      },
      "79": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Hi, Elias. So I would say if I looked at revenue overall, an amount of that did come from we say volume which is the higher peak demand. So what drove that? It appears to be primarily weather not increased consumption. It could be a shift in load about when we\u2019re using those peaks now with more people being at home. So we could be changing the shape of the peak, but not particularly higher load consumed at home. I\u2019d just remind you that a chunk of our distribution business is fixed. So, for example, if you consume more power, there\u2019s a flow through cost of power. So that doesn\u2019t come to Hydro One. So we buy the power, but we just flow that through. So there is no increasing net revenue to Hydro One as a result of that. But there\u2019s a second path of that which is when we received our decision on transmission, we received it in Q2, and we received the number of one-time benefits from that. So we talked about the conservation and demand management revenue. So once that decision was received, we were able to book that. But that relates to prior years. And then we\u2019re also able to book catch-up revenue from Q1 because the decision didn\u2019t come to Q2. So I would say roughly half of it comes from these one-time benefits that was just the timing of the decision and the other half comes from peak demand which is not increased consumption, but it\u2019s a change on where the low peak has occurred. So I\u2019ll say about 50-50 is a way to answer that question, Elias."
