         "Thank you Scott and good morning everyone. As you just heard from Scott we reported financial results that significantly exceeded the expectations we laid out for Q2 during our first quarter call. I will get into more of the specifics around this in a minute but first a summary of the consolidated headlines for the quarter. Revenues were $622 million and adjusted EBITDA was $71.2 million up 8% and 10% respectively. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.86 down 23% from last year's second quarter.",
         "Together with our first quarter results our six months here to date consolidated financial performances as follows. Revenues of $1.26 billion an increase of 18% over the $1.06 billion last year. Adjusted EBITDA of $115.1 million representing 22% growth over the $94.2 million last year with a margin of 9.2% up from the 8.9% in the prior year period.",
         "And adjusted EPS at $1.23 down 15% versus $1.45 per share reported during our same six month period last year. Our adjustments to operating earnings and its GAAP EPS to calculate our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS respectively have been summarized in this morning's press release and remain consistent with our approach and disclosure in prior periods.",
         "I'll now summarize our segmented financial highlights for Q2. Starting with our FirstService Residential division, second quarter revenues came in at $338 million, a 9% decrease over the prior year period. This decline came in slightly better than the 10% to 15% range we provided Q1. Core management revenues were up modestly but were more than offset by ancillary revenue declines in areas we previously called out, specifically amenity management that is our management of pool aquatic restaurant spa and fitness facilities was down in line with forecast.",
         "Other ancillary services several of which carry a higher margins such as transfers and disclosures arising from unit re-sales within our communities, maintenance, construction and project management moderated less than expected. EBITDA for the quarter was $37.2 million a 5% year-over-year decline with an 11% margin up 40 basis points from the 10.6% margin in Q2 of last year. This margin expansion was unexpected as we anticipated a more significant pandemic driven fall off in the quarter in those higher margin ancillary services I just referenced.",
         "With the proactive and meaningful headcount and cost reductions we took in areas with reduced activity levels it more than offset the negative impact to our top-line resulting in the improved margins. When you look at the quarter-over-quarter results for FirstService Residential in the face of the unprecedented pandemic it further reinforces the essential services nature and resiliency of this business.",
         "Now into our FirstService Brands division. In the second quarter we recorded revenues of $283.4 million, a 39% increase over the prior year period driven by contribution from the large global restoration acquisition and partially offset by 10% revenue decline in the division on an organic basis excluding acquisitions. This overall division top-line performance well surpassed our expectations of 0% to 15% revenue growth as communicated to you at Q1.",
         "While our restoration and fire protection platforms performed as expected our home improvement service lines significantly exceeded their Q2 forecasts. At the time of our Q1 results announcement in late April with 85% of North America under some form of lockdown, our assumptions were that these measures would remain in place for almost of Q2.",
         "The easing of government mandated restrictions and social distancing measures across many U.S. states occurred much earlier than expected which allowed our franchise and company owned operations to get into homes, complete jobs and drive increased sales activity. EBITDA for the brand segments during the quarter came in at $35.8 million, up 26% year-over-year and yielding a 12.6% margin lower than the 14% margin in last year's second quarter.",
         "The year-over-year margin decline is due to acquisition mix reflecting the addition of global's lower margin this quarter to the higher Q2 margin profile for the balance of the division. The current quarter margin as with the topline performance significantly exceeded the expectations we provided on our Q1 conference call.",
         "The early reopening of many markets blunted our forecast to decline in system-wide sales and revenues within our home improvement brands and our operators were nimble in re-accelerating their activity levels in markets where governments and homeowners permitted access. This more modest impact to the topline together with pre-emptive and aggressive cost reduction initiatives drove the Brand's division to solid profitability in a challenging environment.",
         "Free cash flow was also exceptionally strong during the quarter. Operating cash flow before working capital changes more than doubled to $53 million over the prior year quarter. With increased focus on cash management and working capital we saw a very strong surge in cash flow after working capital changes to $113 million. For the six months year-to-date we have delivered $153 million of operating cash flow up significantly over the prior year period.",
         "We previously also communicated on our Q1 call the intention to trim our CapEx for the balance of the year. This was reflected in our results with $7 million invested during the second quarter and $22 million year-to-date thus tracking to our reduced full year CapEx estimate of approximately $45 million.",
         "The strong internal cash flow performance helped keep our balance sheet in very good shape throughout the quarter and then as Scott highlighted we further fortified our financial position with $150 million equity private placement allowing us to pivot from defense to offense as we gain greater confidence from our own financial performance and better visibility around tuck-under target prospects.",
         "We exited the second quarter with our net debt at $400 million down significantly from over $630 million at Q1. As a result our leverage as measured by net debt to EBITDA is now at 1.5 times a decline from the 2.4 times level in the first quarter. Our liquidity reflecting total undrawn availability under our revolver and cash on hand was $625 million at quarter end and remains at a record level even after the capital deployed for the Rolyn acquisition post Q2 which Scott earlier described.",
         "Maintaining financial flexibility to further pursue our growth objectives is a cornerstone of our business model and we are as well-positioned as ever to drive forward on these opportunities.",
         "We are very pleased with our overall results to date in the face of COVID-19 and we maintain a positive yet cautious stance on the outlook for the back half of the year. There are obviously many uncertainties around the path of the pandemic with numerous possible outcomes. However, if the current macro environment remains largely intact we believe that for the current full year we will be down modestly year-over-year on an organic basis on the top line but with the full year contribution of global restoration versus half year in 2019 our revenues are expected to marginally exceed the 2019 reported level. We also anticipate that our consolidated EBITDA margin will be largely in line with prior year.",
         "That now concludes our prepared comments. I would ask the operator to please open the call to questions. Thank you."

         "I would now like to turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Scott Patterson. Please go ahead, sir."
      ],
      "Scott Patterson": [
         "Thank you, [Jessie] and welcome everyone to our Q2 earnings call. Thank you for dialing in. Jeremy Rakusin is on the line with me today. We last spoke on April 23. At that time we were all right in the middle of lockdown. About 85 % of North America was under some sort of lockdown or stay at home measure and really there was no clarity around when these measures would be relaxed. We went through a vigorous re-forecasting exercise based on what we were experiencing in mid April to provide some direction and forward guidance with our Q1 report.",
         "Well much has changed over the last three months. As you saw in our release this morning we significantly outperformed our expectations and the guidance we provided. There are a number of factors involved and Jeremy and I will walk you through them.",
         "In terms of agenda this morning, I will start with the summary overview of the results and variances from our forecast. I will then touch on two important highlights from the quarter and then Jeremy will follow with a closer review of the financial results.",
         "Total revenues for the quarter were up 8% over the prior year. Organic revenue declined by 9% year-over-year but this was more than offset by acquisition growth primarily relating to global restoration and several tuck unders over the last 12 months.",
         "EBITDA for the quarter increased by 10% reflecting a 20 basis point increase in margins. At FirstService Residential, revenues were down 9% versus our forecast of down 10% to 15%. At FirstService Brands, revenues were up 39% versus our forecast of flat to up 15%. Margins at both divisions were materially higher than forecast. The principal reason for the outperformance was that markets in general opened up more quickly than anticipated which drove revenue opportunities across both divisions.",
         "At FirstSrvice Residential ancillary revenues proved to be more resilient during the quarter particularly transfer and disclosure income which was down less than forecast in April and May and then spiked in June and was up year-over-year. Home sales across the U.S. were up significantly in June and our results reflected the same trend. At FirstService Brands, residential property service companies including California Closets, CertaPro Painters, Paul Davis, Flora Coverings International and Pillar to Post were welcomed into homes more readily than expected. These brands came out early with clear communication around our in-home safety protocol which opened many doors for us. Our lead conversion and closed rates increased across all these businesses.",
         "On the bottom line the aggressive tact we took in mid-March around cost control set us up to reap the benefits of operating leverage on the stronger than expected revenues.",
         "Performance during the quarter improves sequentially every month with June results across many of our businesses and regions that were near a year ago in terms of revenue. We are seeing a continuation of these strong levels of activity into July and have not yet seen any pullback relating to the surge in new coronavirus cases across many states.",
         "We are extremely pleased with how the quarter played out relative to early expectations. Our teams were aggressive around cost containment and incredibly tenacious about seizing every revenue opportunity that was presented and we continue to deliver on our service excellence promise across every brand.",
         "Our front line teams are performing heroically and differentiating us from our competition. We feel very confident that we will emerge from this pandemic environment in an improved competitive position.",
         "Looking forward we are cautiously optimistic about the back half of the year. Jeremy will provide some general direction in his comments but we will refrain from providing any specific guidance for Q3 or the balance of the year. The economic outlook in North America remains very uncertain and we have some concern that the strength we saw in June across many of our businesses was driven partially by pent-up demand.",
         "Before I hand off to Jeremy I want to talk about two important highlights from the quarter. The first is the $150 million private placement that we completed with durable capital partners on May 22. We ended Q1 with debt to EBITDA leverage of 2.4 times which was right in our target comfort range. The equity rate took us down to 1.8 times on a pro-forma basis and gave us confidence that we could withstand anything the pandemic threw at us, will also be aggressive in terms of add-on acquisitions and strategic investment. We have since greenlighted many initiatives that we paused in the early days of the pandemic and are driving ahead full steam.",
         "An example was the acquisition of Rolyn Companies at the end of the quarter by global restoration; the second highlight I want to talk about.",
         "Rolyn is a leading commercial and large loss restoration company in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. The acquisition is strategically significant for us in that it expands our geographic reach, enhances our competitive position across a number of important verticals and brings in some of the top and most experienced restoration professionals in the industry. Rolyn has nine operations centers in the mid-Atlantic, Northeast and Southeast of the U.S. which complement our footprint and improve our ability to serve national accounts. They bring a diverse client base across healthcare, hospitality, multi-family, education and assisted living verticals.",
         "We've added many new national relationships that we believe we can grow and further penetrate. In particular Rolyn has built an exceptionally strong healthcare practice and the company has been an industry leader supporting healthcare companies and other clients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This is an important move for us and we are very excited about welcoming Sam Bergman, Mark Petrovski and the entire Rolyn team into the global and FirstService families.",
         "On that note I will pass the floor over to Jeremy."

You said there's a possibility for some pent up demand but you also, your comments also said that there was a really strong momentum that continued into July. So can you maybe help us understand maybe where you see that potential for that pent up demand? Is it the lead orders the California Closets or maybe anything around the commentary there?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, we improved sequentially April, May, June and June was particularly strong in terms of leads and book sales and I think that while we have seen it continue, I think there is a feeling that it will be tough to sustain through the balance of the year at current levels. We may see it sustained but with the surge in cases and reading economic reports from other industries in generally I think we share some of the concern that's out there generally that we might see some pullback in the economy. In addition we're watching closely the $600 a week unemployment benefit and when that might end and whether that's propping up some of the home improvement spend."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, George, I'll take that. Yes furloughs reduced house terminations in aggregate you're right over 3,000 at Q1. We've got roughly a third of those back and incrementally we see more coming back as activity levels continue to increase. If we see the opening up of a lot of our amenity-related services at FirstService Residential for example. Particularly in areas like the northeast where pools and aquatic areas still remain closed.",
            "As to the margin outlook in conjunction with that a lot of the cost savings that we realized should remain in place. Some of those costs we're learning through this pandemic to manage with less resources for a given level of revenue than we have before and so we think some of those efficiencies and cost reductions will be permanent. Parsing out how much is permanent and how much is going to come back that's too early to tell but we think there will be some permanent cost reductions that will be reflected in margins going forward."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Great. Just one last one if I may Jeremy, on the working capital it was a really big source of cash halfway through the year. Do you expect that to, I guess to revert to a typical, I guess 1% to 2% of revenue drag that we've kind of seen a lot in the last few years?"

         "Speaker": "George Doumet"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I mean the two biggest areas of the pickup in the working capital piece of the cash flow statement was focused collection and AR collection particularly in this environment and obviously with a bit slower growth you're not investing as much on that front and you're more collecting and harvesting off the revenues that have previously been generated but also on tax some of the government stimulus packages on both sides of the border afford us the opportunity to defer taxes which will be paid in their normal course in the back half of the year. So I would say Q2 is an anomaly on the on the working capital pickup but it did help us with the balance sheet and our financial position."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you. Jeremy, you touched on some of the costs that you believe you'll be able to permanently take out of the equation. Can you provide a bit more color on the sort of where is that coming from? Is that corporate level? Are you are you able to squeeze some costs out of every brand and across the organization?"

      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I mean it's areas like marketing, legal, finance, HR, so a lot of those support functions we're just working with leaner costs but there's going to be a lot less travel whether it's business development, air travel; a lot more virtual business development but even executing on work Cal Closets as an example our designers are able to do a lot more virtual consults versus spending time going home to home. So it's just efficient they're getting a lot more done in a given day a lot more productive and without the associated travel costs. Those are some of the examples. Even in the ancillary services side and FirstService Residential again the teams found ways to optimize the cost structure and I think they're going to be able to generate as much or more revenue with less resources going forward."

      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks for that. My other question relates to your comment about going from defense to offense. Obviously we saw that with the Rolyn acquisition. As we look into the second half leading to next year, I mean how's your appetite right now for acquisition? Do we see you continue the growth as global and into more restoration businesses or are we going to see active in other market segments?"

      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, the appetite is definitely there and as you heard we have the liquidity, we have the balance sheet. So we're prepared to be aggressive but not necessarily more aggressive than we have been over the last several years but we're not slowing down as a result of the pandemic or pausing in any way. We've restarted all of our significant strategic initiatives a lot of them have to do are part of the restoration strategy the re-branding and the investment in the infrastructure and then we continue to work on our acquisition pipeline.",

I just wanted to confirm or just clarify, does the top line impact include the Rolyn acquisition and then secondly with respect to the outlook are you able to give some sort of broad strokes outlook as to how that second half view or full year view is supported by the FirstService Residential and FirstService Brands divisions?"

      },
      "24": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. It does include Rolyn so that would be the -- my comments around us being higher versus reported \u201819 with global in there down on an organic basis but including global and it's tuck-unders. That would be in those numbers. Not too much to say on parsing out the divisions. I mean I would just say that the back half of the year is largely pretty flat profile on the topline. FirstService Residential flat is slightly down most likely and FirstService Brands would be down without the global contribution. If you add in global it would be a relatively flat. So consolidated flat on the back up here on the topline and again the margins are not going to materially differ when we finish the year from last year."

      "25": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then I just wanted to talk just clarify kind of the outlook on the FirstService Brands division. Did I understand correctly that you did see momentum continue into July but then you're sort of feeling a bit more cautious from kind of July onwards? Is that the way to think about how you're expecting the back half of the year in the FirstService Brands division?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, we saw specifically speaking about the home improvement brands, we saw a strong June, strong activity in July but recognize that June was still down year-over-year just significantly better than April and better than expectation. So if we sustained at these levels it it's still down year-over-year on the home improvement side and then restoration and fire are part of that division also."

      },
      "27": {
         "Remarks": [
            "All right. Okay. And that brings it to my final question. On restoration and fire, I think you sort of cited that the trends were in line with what you have expected for the broader brands division in Q2 but did you see any impact around like deep cleaning or sanitization on the Paul Davis or global side?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Stephen MacLeod"
      },
      "28": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, we did. Both platforms benefited from the COVID work. Global, maybe I can start there generally in line with expectation as you suggest it was up modestly over the first quarter and interestingly it was up organically over the prior year, a period when we didn't own it but commercial property claims we believe are down up at least 20% in North America in part due to COVID, in part due to weather and so for global to show growth year-over-year is something we were very pleased about and part of the reason is the COVID related work, it's thousands of different discrete jobs that we performed, they tend to be smaller jobs lower revenue but it did fill that gap for us and enabled us to show some growth year-over-year where otherwise we might have been down.",
            "We have a strong hospitality practice at global and that was down materially because of COVID. So it definitely benefited and it also importantly opened up doors for us and enabled us to engage with new clients that we have since leveraged in them into national accounts and mitigation work.",
            "Paul Davis similarly down only slightly from prior year we expected it to be down more dramatically due to shutdowns and inability to access homes but as we discussed the markets rebounded. Paul Davis was able to get into homes and perform work and then the COVID definitely helped it claw its way back to near year ago. So it's certainly been part of the quarter for us and on the FirstService Residential side we're obviously doing janitorial as part of that service offering. So the protocols have all changed and we're obviously performing COVID cleaning in for our communities. It doesn't drive topline revenue but it's certainly part of their service offering now."

      "29": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Yes. That's great. And maybe just one more if I could with respect to Rolyn, so you talked a lot about the global sanitization work. Can you talk a bit about, I need to know in it for in the quarter but do you have any insight or any data you can provide around how Rolyn has done with their health care exposure?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Similar to global. They, otherwise, would have been perhaps down year-over-year but the COVID gave it a real boost probably more so with Rolyn on a pro-rata basis than global."

With some economy's reopening and then shutting back down, I wanted to ask how it impacted community plans for some of the amenities you operate in the residential segment like pools, gyms and spas. Is there any way you can frame roughly what percentage are open now and how do you expect trends to play out over the rest of the year with the visibility that you have at this point?"

I can sort of talk regionally, I mean the amenity spaces are still shut down here in Ontario and in the Northeast particularly New York City and in a number of other pockets and jurisdictions around North America but otherwise they are open and operating and I think our expectation at this point is that they will stay open. The safety protocols may change in terms of utilization of the amenities. The capacity restrictions may change but we have not seen any rollback of the amenities at this point. I think once they open within the community it might be top unless it's legislated but that hasn't happened yet. I don't know if that \u2013"

I was wondering if you could talk about now if you're, it sounds as though you're going to be re-accelerating that and then putting that investment to work going forward. I wonder if you could talk about how maybe what those investments are and how that's evolved from maybe the way you might have been thinking at the end of last year as far as dollar amount?

High teens contribution from storm activity if you look at the last 5 to 10 years, high teens with it waited a bit more to the back end of the year. In the first half of the year in a normal year we would normally see potentially 10% from storm or CertaPro related activity contributing. This year it's pretty well zero.
