         "Net sales orders in the third quarter increased 38% to 21,519 homes and the value of those orders was $6.3 billion, up 35% from $4.7 billion in the prior year. Our average number of active selling communities was essentially unchanged from both the prior year and sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $294,500, down 2% from the prior year, primarily due to a decline in the average sales price for our West region as more of the region\u2019s mix shifted to our entry level Express brand during the quarter. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 22%, up from 20% in the prior year quarter.",
         "Our net sales orders in both May and June increased by more than 50% compared to the prior year periods. We believe the increase in demand after April has been fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates, the limited supply of homes at affordable price points, and to some extent, pent-up demand. We were and remain well-positioned for this increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lots supply and housing inventories, particularly completed homes and those close to completion. Jessica?",
         "In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 7.9%, down 20 basis points from 8.1% in the prior year quarter. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in our history and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike?",
         "Forestar, our major \u2013 our majority owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer operating in 51 markets across 22 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar as a well-capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint is serving us well during this volatile time and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations with revenue growth of more than 200% and net income growth of 80% fiscal year-to-date in 2020. At June 30, Forestar\u2019s lot position consisted of 50,700 lots, of which 38,300 are owned and 12,400 are controlled through purchase contracts. 77% of Forestar\u2019s owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our master supply agreement.",
         "Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and has approximately $700 million of liquidity, which includes $350 million of unrestricted cash and $350 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At June 30, Forestar\u2019s net debt-to-capital ratio was 25.2% and their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity, and its relationship with D.R. Horton; Forestar is in a very strong position to navigate through changing economic conditions and continue to grow their business. Jessica?",
         "Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company.",
         "During the 9 months ended June, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.2 billion compared to $606 million in the prior year period. At June 30, we had $3.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $1.9 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facilities. Our homebuilding leverage was 18.4% at the end of June, was $2.4 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding, and $400 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months.",
         "At June 30, our stockholders equity was $11 billion and book value per share was $30.38, up 16% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months into June, our return on equity was 19.9% compared to 17.3% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $64 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter and we expect to cautiously manage our level of share repurchases in the near-term to maintain financial flexibility until we have better visibility to future market conditions and our expected operating results. Our outstanding share count is down 2% from a year ago and we currently have an outstanding share repurchase authorization of $535 million. Jessica?"

         "Thank you, Jessica and good morning. I am pleased to be joined \u2013 to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.",
         "We would like to first again express our gratitude to our country\u2019s dedicated field of healthcare workers and to all who are on the frontlines caring for our communities. Our thoughts remain with those affected by this pandemic and our priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, customers, trade partners and the communities we serve. During the latter part of March, the impacts of COVID-19 and related widespread reductions in economic activity across the United States began to negatively affect our business. During April, when restrictive stay-at-home orders were in place for most of our markets, our sales orders decreased and our cancellations increased and our April net sales orders were 1% lower than a year ago. However, as restrictive orders began to be lifted across many markets and economic activity resumed, our sales increased significantly and our cancellations rate returned to normal levels. In both May and June, our net sales orders increased by more than 50% compared to the prior year periods, resulting in a net sales order increase of 38% for the quarter. We sold 5,931 more homes this quarter than the same quarter last year, positioning D.R. Horton to achieve further gains in market share and scale.",
         "We have continued to see strong increases in net sales orders in July compared to the same month last year. Despite the disruption from COVID-19 on our operations, the D.R. Horton team delivered a record third quarter, including net sales orders of 21,519 homes, a 25% increase in consolidated pre-tax income to $782 million and a 10% increase in revenues to $5.4 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin for the quarter improved 170 basis points to 14.5%, while our EPS increased 37% to $1.72 per diluted share. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 21.6% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 19.9%.",
         "While housing market conditions are very strong today, we remain cautious as to the impact that COVID-19 may have on the overall economy and our operations in the future. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity position and experienced operating teams, position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible, operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales base and inventory levels to optimize return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions. Mike?",
         "Our third quarter homebuilding investment in lots land and development totaled $1.1 billion, of which $390 million was for finished lots, $380 million was for land development, and $290 million was for land. $180 million of our land and lot purchases in the third quarter were for Forestar. After slowing our lots and land and development investments in March and April, we have since increased our pace of investments to ensure we maintain an adequate number of finished lots to support our home construction base. Bill?",
         "In closing, our results reflect the strength of our experienced operational teams and it\u2019s relating market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. And we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during this time have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and your positive spirit as you safely continue helping our customers close on their much anticipated new homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions."

         "This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q in the next day or two. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference.",
         "Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.",
         "Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 21.6%, up 30 basis points sequentially from the March quarter and up 130 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. We remain focused on managing the pricing incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter. However, there is uncertainty regarding the future impacts of COVID-19 on the economy and new home demand, which could negatively impact our gross margins in the future. Bill?",
         "Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter was $68.8 million with a pre-tax profit margin of 43.9% compared to $48.1 million and 40.2% in the prior year quarter. Despite the disruption in the secondary mortgage markets in March and April caused by COVID-19 and the uncertainty of the impact of the CARES Act, our mortgage company has continued selling the mortgages that originates at strong net gains. We began retaining servicing rights on some of our FHA and VA loan originations during the third quarter due to disruptions among mortgage servicers and we will continue to monitor developments in the mortgage markets and adjust our operations to adapt to changes in market conditions.",
         "For the quarter, 97% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 71% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 53% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 718 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 91%. First-time homebuyers represented 57% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, reflecting our continued focus on offering homes at affordable price points. Mike?",
         "As we noted last quarter, due to the uncertainty in the U.S. economy and our business operations from COVID-19, we withdrew our guidance for fiscal 2020. Based on today\u2019s market conditions, we are now providing our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. In the fourth quarter, we expect to generate consolidated revenues in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion and to close approximately 18,000 to 19,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter in the mid 21% range and humbling SG&A in the fourth quarter to be 8% to 8.2% of homebuilding revenues. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin in the fourth quarter of approximately 40% and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 23%. We plan to provide annual guidance for fiscal 2021 when we have sufficient visibility into market conditions hopefully on our next earnings call in early November. David?"

         "Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 37% to $1.72 per share compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 33% to $631 million compared to $475 million. The current quarter results, included income tax benefit of $38.1 million related to federal energy efficient home tax credits that were retroactively reinstated earlier in the year.",
         "Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 10% to $5.2 billion on 17,642 homes closed, up from $4.7 billion on 15,971 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was essentially flat with last year at $295,200 and the average size of our homes closed was down 3% reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill?",
         "We ended the third quarter with 32,800 homes in inventory. 12,700 of our total homes were unsold, of which 2,900 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. Due to our significant increase in sales in May and June, the portion of our backlog that is not yet under construction is higher than normal and our number of completed unsold homes is lower than in recent years. As a result, we have accelerated our pace of home starts across most of our communities to ensure we maintain an adequate number of homes available for sale in each community to meet demand.",
         "At June 30, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 335,000 lots, of which 34% were owned and 66% were controlled through purchase contracts. 32% of our total own lots are finished and at least 52% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our current lot portfolio includes an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points and continues to provide us a strong competitive position. David?",
         "DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company focused on suburban garden style apartments that had four projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at the end of the quarter. After selling two projects earlier this fiscal year, no other projects were slated to be marketed and sold during our third or fourth quarters of fiscal 2020.",
         "We expect to market and sell a couple of projects in fiscal 2021, based on our current pace of construction and leasing activity. After pausing construction starts and new acquisitions by DHI Communities in March, April, and May, we began selectively resuming plans for new projects in June and we still plan to grow the DHI Communities platform. DHI Communities assets totaled $225 million at June 30. We also continue to evaluate our opportunities in the market for single family rental homes. We are currently building and leasing homes in nine single family rental communities across our operations, as we are in the early stages of our participation in this growing segment of the housing market.

First question, on the spec inventory supply, not surprisingly came down quite a bit just given the dynamics in the quarter and how strong demand was there. And you mentioned obviously a greater percentage of your backlog right now has not yet started, which makes a lot of sense. I am just curious as you ramp your start activity here and I am sure other builders are doing the same to not only build out your existing backlog, but replace the spec inventory presumably, what are you seeing on the labor side as far as any tightness there, any inflation that\u2019s starting to build up, because it seems like there is a pretty healthy ramp and starts coming?"

We continue to evaluate different opportunities and it still comes down to where we can add, add to the long-term value of the company, where we can add product and new customer base to serve, but more importantly, people that are accretive to the operating teams. So we continue to talk with several private builders, where we are more inclined to look at the tuck-ins that we have done either adding to existing markets or opening up new markets for us. But you won\u2019t see us probably do any massive public acquisitions, but I do think we will continue to evaluate the smaller privates."

That\u2019s obviously extremely encouraging and exemplary, I would say. But we have seen your specs are down and obviously demand has surged significantly. So I guess the bottom line question for me is would you like to increase your spec levels from where they are today and are you able to do so in an environment, where demand is as strong as it has been?"

But as David mentioned before, we have been focusing early on, on the efficiency, in the product, in the operational focus and partnering with our trades and being true that they are capable of supporting the growth that we have in front of us. So we do think we will be able to increase our spec inventory, but it\u2019s not going to be without a lot of effort, I can promise you that."

I wanted to ask a second question about pricing and the pricing environment. It would \u2013 it seems obviously that Express remains extremely strong. I am curious if you are seeing increased interest in Freedom and the traditional, D.R. Horton business more recently and whether that allows for a little bit more pricing flexibility perhaps than we had seen in the past, particularly the D.R. Horton semi-custom business. And a second half of that question is whether or not you are seeing the mix of local demand versus out-of-state demand driving what you saw in May and June and is there a difference in your ability to price \u2013 push price for when you are selling to a local versus out-of-state?"

As to the state question, I would say we\u2019re seeing increase in demand from both of my profiles. The relocation of people down to a more affordable tax-friendly environment continues. I think COVID maybe is even accelerating that. Pricing is something we track week-to-week, based upon demand at each individual flag and it\u2019s kind of \u2013 I\u2019ve always considered pricing at our sites. You want to \u2013 you never want to be in a position where you push pricing so hard that you have to come back and adjust it back down. You always want people to feel like if they buy today, they will save a little bit money \u2013 they will save money versus buying 6 months or a year from now. So, fortunately, our company, the entire structure and mentality is that those decisions are made in the individual communities and divisions and the people that are closest to the market actually, we feel make a better decision than we can make up here."

But in this industry, I mean you saw what happened at the end of March completely out from nowhere. So, I do think we will have a lot more visibility as we get into the November/December time period next year, and hopefully we can reinstate the guidance numbers that we can then turnaround again."

We are probably maybe a little bit less finished with the specs because of the strong sales demand that we\u2019ve had, they\u2019ve moved to the sold category and we have them sort of set to close, if you will \u2013 sold to close in the September quarter. So, we feel really good about the ability to deliver the fourth quarter and the starts plan that we have out and the building permits we\u2019re able to accumulate.

So, we did see firming pricing trends, firming incentives and in turn \u2013 but to see where that\u2019s going to go, we\u2019re going to need the market and right now we feel really strong about the sales trends that we\u2019re seeing without needing to do heavy incentives. But everyday, at Horton Communities, there is some level of incentives and potential pricing adjustments to meet the market whether that\u2019s up or down, and we do see tremendous value created with the urgency for buyers, as David mentioned before, feeling like they will save a little bit of money if they act today rather than wait for a few more weeks."

So it\u2019s \u2013 I do believe we have a competitive advantage, people and capital and just operational efficiency. So I can tell you right now we are seeing a lot of deals.

At the same time, you guys are looking at very, very strong results currently and into July, I was just trying to get a sense for maybe how that reconciles, Forestar maybe looking at a bit less of a delivery year than originally planned despite demand coming back extremely strong for you. How those two kind of fact patterns work against each other, because I would have thought perhaps and maybe it\u2019s just a more of a timing issue, but a 1,000 lots is not immaterial, so, just trying to get a sense of how to reconcile those two data points?"

And Forestar was reestablishing just preliminary delivery guidance for fiscal \u201821 at a time in which their largest company \u2013 largest customers not providing 2021 guidance. So, it\u2019s just early, felt like it was important for Forestar to reestablish at least a baseline expectation for their top line growth next year given that they are truly a growth story and the revenues have been up over 200% this year, but it is a bit conservative we hope. And as we live over the next few months and as D.R. Horton gets sufficient visibility to provide guidance for fiscal 2021, our hope would be if certainly if demand trends continue as they are right now, the strength continues in the industry, I would expect that Forestar would ultimately be able to exceed that and increase their guidance over time.

Is there \u2013 and I know you are not giving fiscal \u201821 guidance at this point, but just conceptually perhaps, if you are looking at your gross margins and backlog currently and what you are seeing on the ground, in terms of just achieving some incremental pricing, achieving some incremental scales, etcetera. Is there any reason to think that you wouldn\u2019t be able to hit like the 22% gross margin next year with all those factors just given the momentum you have right now.

And right now, we\u2019re seeing our inventory turns accelerate. Our sales pace obviously has increased dramatically in the last few months, which did work down our completed homes \u2013 completed specs. So, our completed spec inventory is lower than it has been in some time. Also, the component of our backlog that is sold, but not started is higher than normal. So, as we accelerate our starts pace, that will bring those to back to a closer \u2013 closer to a normal level, and we expect to still deliver very strong volume.

But a lot of our floor plans today accommodate at a lesser aggregate square footage, a lot of very functional space, whether that\u2019s flex rooms or four bedrooms that work very well for them today. So, we are really pleased with the product offering that we have out there. But fortunately, in most of our neighborhoods, we are able to respond to buyer demand very quickly and adjust to what the current buyers in our sales offices are asking for with our inventory homes with the next round of starts we have in given neighborhood."

Question on SG&A a little bit, as you are trying to ramp back up on the land spend and get some more flags in the ground, is there any sort of near-term disrupt \u2013 not disruption, but are you going to have to reinvest in hiring people or do you need to start reaccelerating technology investments to keep up with the pace of demand right now? Is there anything on the SG&A side that we should consider in the near-term as demand has so rapidly increased that you need to accelerate some investment there?"

We did briefly have a hiring freeze during that month or so at the beginning of the pandemic, but we\u2019re back to normal in terms of hiring across our homebuilding and financial services operation. We are growing the business. We are always hiring and adding where we need to. Same thing on technology, we\u2019ve been making continuing investments over the last number of years and we\u2019ve redirected some of those during the pandemic to address the work-from-home environment and a few things like that, but those expenditures are not anything that\u2019s really out that it\u2019s going to move the needle in total, because there\u2019s also things we\u2019re not spending as much money on today. Travel is not as big a portion of our spending as in the past. Hopefully at some point it can be. But we are in a company lull in terms of our historical SG&A percentages and expect to be able to stay at that level going forward."

It seems like your thoughts have evolved on that potential market opportunity and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of maybe the potential for a build for rent product offering in your communities. I just wonder if you could expand upon your thoughts at this point. Is that something you would like to have a portfolio that you could operate internally? Would you look to sell those as you build them or partner with another operator? Just how do you think about single family rentals at this point?"

We feel really good about the handful of communities, I believe nine communities today that we have homes being constructed for the purpose of rental and we will have to see. We will have to see what the market brings us if we bring some of those communities to market for sale or if we build a portfolio to operate or aggregate to a portfolio for eventual disposition. It\u2019s something we are learning our way into today. So we will be back with you as that progresses."

The first question I wanted to go back to the sold but not started in backlog and I think you guys mentioned a few times and Bill, you responded to a previous question that percentage is higher than normal, which makes sense. Could you actually \u2013 could you give us what that percentage is in terms of what\u2019s sold but not started and how that compares on a year-over-year basis? And maybe as part of that, I don\u2019t know if you have any quantification of kind of like what an average \u2013 I know your build cycle is flat, but what an average delivery quote would be in terms of what you are able to quote to new buyers today versus what you would normally be able to?"

Right now, we would not be able to quote to you an average because it\u2019s going to vary based upon which community you\u2019re in and the level of production that\u2019s available within that community and the type of product that it is. In some communities, we have a very quick build time and can deliver homes from start to completion in three months. In others it may be a four or five-month build cycle. And then generally, we\u2019re looking if we have inventory that\u2019s available to move in within the next 30 days as soon as you can clarify your mortgage situation and get qualified. We\u2019d like to have a home that\u2019s ready for you as soon as you can \u2013 you need it."

The \u2013 are you getting the sense that your local operators are \u2013 given some of the uncertainty that may still be out there, they are making the decision to let pace run a little hard for the foreseeable future just to capture what\u2019s out there while it\u2019s still out there type of mentality versus those operators pushing price more aggressively. I know you talked about incentives coming down but just wondering if you have kind of a pulse of what your local operators are leaning toward today?"

            "Mike, the pace versus price versus margin has a lot to do with community size or it is in the community. You may push price in a community where you\u2019re on the back end of it and your deliveries sales pace is going to be three or four months\u2019 worth of inventory or 6 or 7 months\u2019 worth of inventory. And then you have other communities where you might have a thousand lots in front of you and driving pace actually generates a higher return than trying to find that absolute right margin dollar that either cuts off sales or allows sales to increase. And we trust our operators in the field to make those decisions we incentivize them to make good decisions. And it\u2019s a model that\u2019s been a part of the company for the 32 years I\u2019ve been here and it seems to be working. So, it really is a community by community process."
