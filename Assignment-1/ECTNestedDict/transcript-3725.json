         "Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone. Before we begin, I quickly want to remind everyone that management\u2019s remarks this morning may contain certain forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected today. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them.",
         "Factors that might affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review these detailed safe harbor and risk factor disclosures. Please also note that where we feel appropriate, we will continue to refer to non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income to evaluate our business. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and accompanying materials.",
         "Now, let me turn the call over to Dr. Coustas, who will provide the broad overview of the quarter. John?",
         "Thank you, John, and good morning again to everyone. I will briefly review the results for the quarter and then give the call participants the opportunity to ask questions.",
         "Adjusted net income of $42.5 million for the current quarter is higher by $8.2 million, when compared to adjusted net income of $34.3 million for the second quarter of 2019. We have adjusted our net income this quarter for deferred finance fees amortization of $4 million. This increase between the 2 quarters is the result of a $4.5 million increase in operating revenues, a $5.8 million decrease in net finance expenses, and a $1.7 million increase in the operating performance of our equity investment in Gemini, partially offset by a $3.8 million increase in total operating expenses.",
         "More specifically, operating revenues increased by $4.5 million to $116.8 million in the current quarter, compared to $112.3 million in the second quarter of 2019. This increase is attributed to a $13.2 million increase in revenues as a result of contractual step-ups in charter rates following the installation of scrubbers and the addition of 3 vessels to our fleet, partially offset by a $3.4 million decrease in revenues attributed to lower re-chartering and fleet utilization given the softer market conditions and a $5.3 million decrease in revenues due to lower non-cash revenue recognition U.S. GAAP accounting.",
         "Vessel operating expenses increased by $1.3 million to $28.6 million in the current quarter from $27.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, and that was a result of the increase in the average number of vessels in our fleet. While at the same time the average daily vessel operating costs decrease to $5,787 per day for the current quarter from $5,884 per day in the second quarter of 2019, and remains as one of the most competitive in the industry.",
         "G&A expenses decreased by $0.5 million to $6 million in the current quarter compared to $6.5 million in the second quarter of 2019, mainly due to decrease non-cash recognition of stock-based compensation.",
         "Interest expense excluding finance cost, amortization and accruals decreased by $5.1 million to $9.8 million in the current quarter compared to $14.9 million in the second quarter of 2019. This improvement is attributed to a $95.8 million decrease in our average indebtedness and the reduction of U.S. dollar LIBOR by 155 basis points between the 2 periods.",
         "Finally, adjusted EBITDA increased by 6%, or $4.5 million to $80.1 million in the current quarter from $75.6 million in the second quarter of 2019. For the reasons outlined earlier on this call.",
         "With that, I would like to thank you for listening to this first part of our call. Operator, we are now ready to open the call to Q&A."
      ],
      "John Coustas": [
         "Thank you, Evangelos. Good morning and thank you all for joining today\u2019s call to discuss our result for the second quarter of 2020. We are pleased to report improved adjusted earnings for both the second quarter of 2020 and the first 6 months of the year.",
         "The company\u2019s adjusted net income of $42.5 million for the second quarter of 2020 increased by $8.2 million or 23.9% when compared to adjusted net income of $34.3 million for the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA also improved by $4.5 million or 6% to $80.1 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $75.6 million for the second quarter of 2019. Although economic activity has been subdued since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, we have seen increasing signs of confidence with liner companies in recent weeks, as a number of previously blanked sailings have been reinstated, implying the demand is gradually improving.",
         "This is also translated into improving charter rates for vessels greater than 4,000 TEU in size. Recently reported financial results of the liner companies have also been encouraging since, as we had anticipated, prudent capacity management, reduced bunker prices and falling interest rates have more than compensated for the drop in volumes caused by the pandemic.",
         "We are also cautiously optimistic about medium-term market outlook. The orderbook is currently in single-digits as a percentage of the world fleet for the first time in 20 years. Combined with an anticipated reduction in speeds due to the various environmental initiatives, the supply side outlook is healthy. Tighter supply will help to accelerate the recovery in the container market.",
         "We continue to execute our strategy and we are well insulated from near-term volatility due to our high charter coverage of 85% in terms of operating revenues and 62% in terms of operating days over the next 12 months. This provides significant visibility into our cash flows during this period.",
         "By now, we have concluded all scrubber installation investments and took delivery of 2 8,500 TEU vessels during the second quarter. Finally, we have ample liquidity and a $1.2 billion charter backlog, which provides us with flexibility to both manage our business and react to growth opportunities that may present themselves.",
         "Given continued uncertainty about the duration of the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing economic recovery, we are focused on maintaining a conservative financial profile and making thoughtful capital allocation decisions that align with our strategy and market expectations.",
         "We also remain committed to operational excellence and technological innovation, which allows us to continuously deliver high-quality service to our customers. Our commitment has enabled us to maintain our leadership position in the container shipping industry throughout multiple market cycles and during the current challenging environment. We believe that our focus and strategy will ultimately enhance shareholder value far and above the steel value of our fleet.",
         "And then, I\u2019ll hand the call back over to Evangelos, who will take you through financials for the quarter. Evangelos?"

And although I\u2019ve kind of advocated for dividends during this year, share repurchases at these levels certainly make the most sense.",
            "So with that said, authorization is one thing, implementation is another. So based on the current trading volumes, it would probably take a while to repurchase $10 million worth of shares, right? But do you expect to do a tender offer or a privately negotiated transaction here during 3Q?"

What we wanted is practically for the Board to authorize the share purchases one way or the allocation of capital. And, it will \u2013 we would not have any specific, let\u2019s say, kind of targets. We just wanted to have, let\u2019s say, these two in place. And we will use it depending on circumstances and opportunities."

We have not really seen especially in the larger vessels that we are looking for, any interesting opportunities, any collapsing prices or anything like that. As I said, for the time being, I think we have a very good fleet and we will concentrate on the employment of the vessels and to be able to secure even longer term commitment so that we increase the visibility of our cash flows."

         "Remarks": [

They dropped down to something like $7,000. And now, they\u2019re back up to, whatever, $10,500 or so. Yeah, I mean, that\u2019s more or less where we are on that kind of segment."

Right, you\u2019ve mentioned, I think it\u2019s 85% in your presentation, 95% of 2020s, pretty much contracted. Charters, still all on board in terms of payments and everything. We\u2019ve seen some of your peers do some kind of reduction in extension for charters. But how do you feel about your counterparties and your current kind of charter backlog here?"

There were some discussions about, let\u2019s say, extensions with kind of a small discount. Some companies have already reported that they have done similar deal. We are looking \u2013 if it makes sense to get a small discount and extend the charter for a couple of years.",
            "This is part of our strategy into ensuring let\u2019s say visibility. But the good thing is that all our customers are in very good financial shape. If you see one after the other, the results which we are actually publishing show a much stronger EBITDA than whatever they had budgeted at the beginning of the year even without the pandemic."

Obviously, the shares are trading very cheaply here. And $10 million is not a huge sum of cash with your substantial charter backlog. So great quarter and keep it up. Thank you."

I mean, what is happening, of course, is that we are unable to change crews, which, of course, has a positive and achieve part that we don\u2019t incur traveling expenses. On the other hand, for the crew that we are managing to change, all the associated costs are higher. We\u2019re not talking about mixing huge numbers, but we\u2019re sure it\u2019s above what was budgeted. It\u2019s not \u2013 all these costs are not really, I mean financially make a bright situation. What is really much more important for us is to ensure that we manage properly all this process and the people that we have in board are in the proper and should condition to be able to continue their duty."

Can you give us, is there anything more that needs to be done either from a refinancing perspective, if you have kind of a portfolio on the debt side of the house relatively sort of fixed where you want it to be, just want to get a sense of kind of where you are in that process?"

We do not have, of course, any pressure, I mean, our debt matures, and 2023, so we\u2019ve got plenty of time ahead. But if there are, let\u2019s say, going to be opportunities to either use the course, or to be able to change the profile or anything like that, we\u2019re always looking at opportunities like that.

And I guess maybe my last question is a bit more sort of conceptual, when you think about the liner industry and the incremental consolidation that we\u2019ve seen over the course of the last few years, gotten to the point where there seems to be a bit more discipline from the big players. And like sailing capacity management has become more of a hallmark of the industry. As a capacity provider, how do you think the next couple of years play out in that respect? Would you still expect to see sort of the historical split between chartered in capacity and liner own capacity to hold, do you think that there could be potential any changes to that whether in favor of liner capacity or chartered-in capacity?"

I mean, here, as also deferred our business model is at least for the long-term deals, is competing with the Chinese region companies. And in this respect, liner companies have approach to these Chinese lessors to do most of their new buildings and rather than relying to us also, because we don\u2019t have any more of the benefits of off balance sheet financing when the new accounting rules came into existence."

And I think, he recommended $0.80 per share per year. Obviously COVID had the company put that on hold, which made a lot of sense, though now the markets recovering.

So is that how you guys are thinking about it, is it \u2013 you have this opportunistic buyback, but to the extent that opportunity is not available to shareholders expect that capillary returned to be a dividend.

It\u2019s on the basis that we will be able to maintain. We are in \u2013 to date in a scope in \u2013 let\u2019s say, strange circumstances. What is happening, I mean, today with the world economy has no precedent. So we cannot commit into these kind of long-term initiatives like the dividend. And at this moment, I\u2019ve not seen many companies including dividend have seen companies cutting dividends or using them or some of them, keeping them, but no one initiating. And the other hand there may be also an opportunity for the share repurchase, tend to we have asked the board to add that kind of tool in all the management initiatives that we may have to enhance shareholder value."
