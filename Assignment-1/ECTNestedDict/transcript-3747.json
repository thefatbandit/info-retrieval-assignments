         "Thank you, Kavita and welcome everyone. On the call with me today are Suri Suriyakumar, our Chairman, President and our Chief Operating Officer; Dilo Wijesuriya, and Jorge Avalos, our Chief Financial Officer. Our second quarter results for 2020 were publicized earlier today in a press release. The press release and other company materials are available from our Investor Relations pages on ARC Document Solutions site at ir.e-arc.com.",
         "In today\u2019s earnings announcement, ARC offered expanded supplemental disclosures to provide shareholders and analysts with additional information in advance of our quarterly conference call. The disclosures are largely historical and will not be read on today\u2019s call. Please note that today\u2019s call will contain forward-looking statements that fall within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and such statements are only predictions based on information as of today, August 4, 2020, and actual results may differ materially as a result of risks and uncertainties that we highlight in our quarterly and annual SEC filings. This call will also contain references to certain non-GAAP measures, which are reconciled in today\u2019s press release and in our Form 8-K filing.",
         "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Suri Suriyakumar. Suri?"
      ],
      "Dilo Wijesuriya": [
         "Thank you, Suri. Before I dive into the details, I must mention that a company like ours could not have possibly survived the crisis of this nature, if not for the hard work and commitment from our highly skilled and tenured staff. The onslaught of restrictions due to the pandemic made operating conditions difficult and risky and yet our teams rose to the occasion and are immensely productive. While the pandemic was a blow to our industry and our customers, our ability to be nimble and agile gave us the opportunity to make quick changes to the way we do business and adapt to the customer and their new social needs. Here are some of the ways that we \u2013 some of the sort of key changes we put into place immediately.",
         "We converted most of our print ordering systems to the web and mobile apps. We restructured the print centers to print high-volume COVID graphics. We changed our delivery systems to accommodate customers\u2019 new delivery requirements such as curbside pickups, contactors\u2019 deliveries and digital distribution of prints throughout North America. We developed and released technology to connect customers to their home, office and our printers nationwide. We released touchless printing using our existing ARC print app. We improved on the graphics consulting skills of our sales reps. We increased investment in our web, social and e-marketing campaigns. Put simply, we were able to create new revenue lines by identifying the opportunities that have been caused by the pandemic. As a result, our revenue lines are changing, and we have reengineered the company to take advantage of the new demand, which, in turn, are opening up new verticals for us of robust catalogs of health and safety signage introduced us to healthcare and emergency services.",
         "Our social distancing signage services showcased ARC to grocery stores, banks, car dealerships and many retail customers of all kinds. We helped restaurants, coffee shops and other foodservice clients to reopen and manage their newly configured to-go business. Energy companies that could not close their doors but needed a way to manage documents, printing equipment and document workflow found that we could not only help them, but improve their efficiencies, a critical benefit with a few people in the offices. The same services have been applied to city and municipal government offices as well. And with the disruptions affecting education, school districts in every state and of all sizes are turning to us in great numbers for our expertise and production capacity to help them reopen and safely manage students from kindergarten ages, through university and graduate-level programs. And of course, every employee that is working with documents from home needs a vendor who can offer project consultancy and national print network, high-quality print with quick turnaround, and cloud- and mobile-enabled services. We are the company who can strongly capitalize on these needs and be that vendor for large multinational customers as well as regional and local businesses. Our sales performance in the last quarter is a perfect testament to this.",
         "When our MPS customers return to work over the next couple of months, we are well prepared to grow all our revenue lines from the new normal. Investment and our primary focus on new sales will continue to be directed in support of the following service categories. Graphics and imaging services, these are all-print, high-end graphic services where we provide project consultancy, design and installation services. We support all customer verticals. On-site print services, MPS, equipment, supplies and services and digital services, scanning, indexing, archival and other technology-based document management services. During the last 4 months, our priority has been to keep our employees and customers safe while supporting the new industry workflows. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals and keep the company strong and position ourselves for future growth.",
         "For now, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Jorge Avalos. Jorge?"
      ],
      "Jorge Avalos": [
         "Thank you, Dilo. Picking up on Suri\u2019s comments about not looking back, I want to point out how we are positioning ARC for the future. We assume that many of the changes we saw in the marketplace would become permanent. We were very clear-eyed about what was likely to come back and what was not, and we realized quickly that holding on to business lines, processes and resources in the hopes of a rapid economic recovery was not the right answer. While sales will almost certainly grow and new opportunities will arise as the virus comes more firmly under control, our customer base is likely to be permanently diversified. New customers who are demanding our services now are likely to stay with us and they may replace legacy customers. Likewise, we think work-from-home practices will endure past any pandemic, and touchless delivery, some forms of social distancing, and other health and safety practices that affect our business are not likely to go away anytime soon.",
         "With that in mind, we acted very quickly and accomplished most of the following changes early in the quarter. There is certainly more to do as we work out the details. But in summary, we looked at our direct cost of sales as well as our selling, general and administrative expenses in light of our perspective on a post-COVID environment and right-sized our cost structure for the future. The execution of our plan was challenging, but our goals were simple. Maintain gross margins above 30%, improve our EBITDA margin, maintain our strong cash flows and further strengthen the balance sheet and capital structure. The urgency we assigned to the changes we made produced an immediate impact, most of which are obvious as we report the second quarter results.",
         "Our gross margin was nearly 32% for the quarter. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 million on $64 million of sales for the period. Our EBITDA margin of 16.6% is a 200 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2019 on sales that were down nearly $35 million year-over-year due to the pandemic. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter were $23.5 million, more than $7 million higher than prior year. And most importantly, throughout all this, we increased our cash balance from $38.1 million on March 31, 2020, to $58.4 million on June 30. That\u2019s more than a $20 million increase in just 3 months, all coming from cash generated from operations. None of it was a result of loans or acquiring other forms of debt. All of these accomplishments helped contribute to the reduction of our net debt leverage ratio from 2x EBITDA to 1.75x. As Suri pointed out earlier, we did take measures in the second quarter that will not be repeated in future quarters, deferring equipment lease payments, landlord negotiations and a few others. But our performance demonstrates the importance we put on creating an environment where we could not only withstand the economic disruption of the pandemic, but create opportunities for growth and the creation of value in the future.",
         "At this point, I will turn the call back to Suri. Suri?"

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the ARC Document Solutions 2020 Q2 Earnings Report Call. At this time, all participants are a in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to David Stickney, Vice President of Investor Relations."
      ],
      "Suri Suriyakumar": [
         "Thank you, David, and welcome, everyone. As I highlighted in our preliminary announcement last month, the pandemic has left a devastating effect on our industry. Many of these effects will be reversible. Extended shutdowns and the widespread acceptance of remote work arrangements have permanently changed how our customers print and distribute documents and information. In addition, the pandemic has forced our customers who previously resisted the user technology to adapt to a variety of solutions to manage and share documents in digital form. As a result, it became clear that several of ARC\u2019s existing revenue segments and business models would permanently be impaired. Therefore, it was necessary that we identified these segments immediately and to cater to eliminate the redundant cost and infrastructure related to these services.",
         "While doing this, we also recognized that printing and visual imaging services continue to remain a valuable service, both in private and public sector businesses. In a post-pandemic era, we are already experiencing the important role visual imaging services play, especially in influencing social distancing, along with wellness and safety practices in workplaces, schools, shopping malls, et cetera. With our domain knowledge and a national footprint, we are in a unique position to develop products and services to serve these needs and take advantage of these opportunities. It is also well-known that the secular headwinds in our business have been eroding our revenue streams for years. Considering that we have been exploring a business transformation, we saw this as a perfect opening to reengineer our company. The difficulty we faced was time. Declines in revenue were rapid and losses could easily endanger our business continuity. We needed to act fast and reengineer every aspect of the company. While challenging, this test was also exciting. The new revenue opportunities we identified, while smaller, were vibrant and had greater potential than our historical business lines in terms of growth, especially given the existing infrastructure and deep domain knowledge we already persist in the industry.",
         "To make the most of these opportunities, we made significant changes to our entire company in sales and marketing, operations, finance, technology and even our corporate functions. Our goal was to build a strong and vital operating company with potential for new growth and remove all of the redundant capacity, assets and infrastructure. The results have been gratifying to say the least. We were able to realize extraordinary reductions in costs, making significant operating changes and position ARC to take advantage of future opportunities in record time. And we also did so without any additional disruption than was already being felt from the pandemic. More importantly, we were able to produce an operating strategy that will deliver a greater percentage of EBITDA and cash on revenues.",
         "I am pleased to announce that we were able to exceed our previously announced expectation in terms of EBITDA and cash, generating $10.7 million of EBITDA on roughly $64 million in sales during the second quarter was an example of what we think is sustainable going forward. Generating $23.5 million in cash flows from operations in the second quarter is an exceptional result and was the product of both the strength of our operating model as well as a number of onetime efforts in the light of the pandemic. If I could leave you with just one impression from this quarter it is that we are not looking back. Today, we are a digital print and graphics imaging consultant for the next generation. ARC is a $260 million company with growth opportunities, annual adjusted EBITDA generation of in excess of 15%. Cash generation will be consistent and will remain as strong as it was prior to the pandemic. The strategy we have developed is sound, and we are very confident in our ability to build on it.",
         "To give you an idea of what that looks like in practice, I will now ask Dilo and then Jorge, to provide details and concrete examples of ARC will be operating in the future. Dilo?",
         "Thank you, Jorge. Operator, we are now available for all listeners\u2019 questions, if there are any."

It seems like for some reason, you used the pandemic to finally make a lot of changes, because I look at a 5-year chart of the company stock and it\u2019s gone from the ski slope down from $7 to $1. So it\u2019s nice to see that you are finally doing something to improve the business. But on a going-forward basis, what should we expect, let\u2019s say, in the next quarter? I heard something along the lines of some things won\u2019t be repeated or this or that? Like what is \u2013 what is ARC supposed to be looking like on a going-forward basis? And then I just would like to follow-up after I get a little more clarity."

All we are saying is we have reengineered the company to be able to generate a certain amount of EBITDA cash based on the expectation that we will drive a certain amount of revenue. So we are thinking about it as a new company \u2013 let me finish. And once we \u2013 now that we have done one quarter, we are confident that we expect to operate on the same basis. Go ahead. Okay \u2013 so okay. Thank you. So the base revenue is around \u2013 in the mid-60s millions. That\u2019s my base that I should be thinking about?"

But I think the fact that we have the national footprint and we have the ability to do what we have been doing traditionally, it certainly gives us a leg up to serve larger customers of a bigger scale very comfortably.

That kind of stuff is very hard for a small signage company to pull off with school districts, oncologists and universities or health care facilities, shopping malls. All of these large customers who have large properties require health and safety signage now that they are opening up, and that\u2019s really becoming a significant part of our business strategy as well. But what we see that is \u2013 now that we start servicing these customers, not necessarily restricted to a specific industry clan, it will allow us to actually spread our wins into other industries and other verticals that we have previously not been in."

And to what you mentioned earlier, via our systems, our technology systems and the cloud systems are pretty much geared to managing the customers\u2019 print assets in a central platform and distribute and print. So during the COVID sign, everybody went into a shutdown. Some of the largest property managers set up national accounts with us to keep all their \u2013 the signage assets in one platform and make it available for all their buildings, right? I mean, a lot of companies manage their own building or \u2013 which are multi-tenant buildings. There are some large campuses, where one company occupies the whole building, right? So we have been supporting those type of companies with signage all across the U.S. So definitely, the footprint, our expertise in understanding the graphics, the quality of printing and the cloud platform helped us to secure those type of regional and national customers."

Just because you get a \u2013 the timing of when you make the payment has no bearing on the expense. So, all the expenses related to facility leases, equipment, it\u2019s reflected in our Q2 results. So I wanted to start first there and make that clear. In regards to the deferment, we did have about $3 million of capital lease payments deferment. When those are going to get paid back, what we negotiated with our manufacturers is we\u2019re going to just add on two or three months at the end of the lease terms. As you know, we probably have 6,000 to 8,000 different equipment leases out there that are individual leases. So if it\u2019s due in a year from now, if it\u2019s due 3 years from now, you just tack on 2 months at the end of that lease term. So that\u2019s going to be spread out, that $3 million, over 3 to possibly 4-year period in regards to the landlord leases, probably an equivalent number there where we deferred about $3 million in payments. And that will get paid out over 2021, ratably 1/12 every month for 12 months. Is that helpful?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, that was exactly helpful. And then just one other question comment and maybe a little long-winded, in point of fact, the stock, over a multiyear period has performed relatively poorly. The company has indicated over a period of time that given that the business, I realize it\u2019s a lower base now, it does not have tremendous growth. The industry, in fact, has been consolidating. That one avenue would be to return capital to shareholders, either through dividends or buybacks. I know you bought back stock in the past, including in the first quarter and you paid a dividend in the past, so I understand you\u2019ve done some of that. However, the question that I want to raise is, this is a company which just generated $20 million in cash flow and felt it was imprudent to pay a $0.5 million dividend. I\u2019m trying to understand how strong \u2013 and you can \u2013 Suri is a meaningful shareholder, but you all own some stock. How meaningful the commitment to returning capital to shareholders is if, in fact, you\u2019re concerned about under $0.5 million \u2013 $0.01, under $0.5 million expenditure on dividends is, when you\u2019re generating $20 million of cash?"

      "67": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Right. So what \u2013 so to answer that question, it\u2019s real simple. It\u2019s not because we lack confidence. Obviously, there is \u2013 there are a lot of unknowns, and we have only gone through one single quarter. And what we did during this period of time is unprecedented, Walter. So here\u2019s another way to think about it. Because our business got impaired so badly, what we did was we \u2013 when we reengineered the business, we started off with a clean sheet of paper, right? And we identified all of the needs our customers have today and likely to have in the next few years, right? We identified all those segments and then rebuilt the company to fit, to serve those customer needs. So what we have done is unprecedented. We have reengineered literally every part of the company, from corporate, from IT, operations, sales literally every part of the company. And so in itself, it\u2019s such an extensive exercise. Right at the time we started doing this, it was just doom and gloom because literally every location was checked, our revenues were significantly low. And we\u2019ve been able to overcome that by reengineering the company and going after this new revenue segments very quickly by pivoting and adapting ourselves. Now that we have generated, delivered the results, we feel good about the results. So remember, the decision we took to put dividends on hold was immediately after the pandemic. We want to make sure that we are not too \u2013 what you call \u2013 too much in a hurry, making changes immediately without really understanding. So I think if we continue to produce quarters like this \u2013 and we really feel very good about the fundamentals we have in place, especially the business trends we are seeing. So it\u2019s all about a business trend. So we are \u2013 unlike in the past, literally watching business on a daily basis, our daily sales, how the trends are moving on. So we want to make sure that when we are making those decisions, we are making those decisions on really good fundamentals. So we have had a good quarter. And if we happen to have more good quarters like that, obviously \u2013 we have excess cash, and we\u2019ll be very, very happy to make the decision to pay the dividends. Like you said, we did buy back stock. We did actually slow down paying back \u2013 the debt back to the banks, and we did pay dividends. So we \u2013 it is not like we didn\u2019t try that. We did that for 2 quarters. And it\u2019s certainly something that we want to do. But the pandemic is not over yet. It\u2019s something that we are very mindful of, right? And so the signs in the marketplace with regard to what\u2019s happening in the marketplace and what\u2019s happening with the pandemic, is still not settled. I\u2019m sure everyone will agree with that. So we just want to make sure that we are making those decisions \u2013 well thought out decisions. It\u2019s not because we lack confidence. Obviously, we have the cash, and we feel very good about it. And this is even without getting any federal or government assistance. This is cash generated by the company."
