         "Thanks Ken, and good morning everyone. We would like to thank you for joining us today for our fiscal 2021 second quarter conference call.",
         "Though the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic still looms large over industry activity and our own business, the implementation of our rebranding strategy and our move away from the traditional land seismic leasing business is enabling us to more fully realize our strategic vision and strengthen the company\u2019s prospects in the global marine industry. I\u2019ll come back and address this important milestone in a moment, but first let me start by making some general comments about the second quarter.",
         "As Rob will more fully explain, with our decision to exit the land leasing business, those leasing operations are now reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements. The results from continuing operations reflect those of our ongoing business, marine technology products.",
         "As we anticipated, there was a reduced level of activity as well as widespread general market uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, our marine technology products segment posted higher sequential revenues despite lingering COVID-related restrictions. Sequentially, our second quarter results were up from Q1 with consolidated revenues from our marine technology businesses rising by roughly 60%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues from these continuing operations were down by about 25%.",
         "All things considered, we are pleased with the performance of our marine technology business in these adverse conditions; however, there are still restrictions in place which have constrained our operations and frustrated our efforts to reach some of our pre-pandemic goals. ",
         "As we touched on last quarter, all of our facilities are operational though with certain restrictions and new procedures due to COVID. Regulations can vary significantly from location to location and tend to change rapidly, which presents a challenge to daily operations. The resulting uncertainty and travel restrictions, particularly internationally we believe have had a significant impact on the ability and willingness of customers to make firm commitments. ",
         "On the other hand, COVID concerns don\u2019t appear to have greatly impacted inquiry and bid activity in the marine industry as both have actually remained quite robust with a high degree of customer interest and engagement, despite all the uncertainty. However, this strong interest has not been accompanied by a similar level of orders as COVID restrictions are causing travel-related limitations when attempting to conduct some product testing and demonstrations. As a result and as I just said, customers seem reluctant to make commitments.",
         "With that said, let me now return to the subject of our strategic rebranding and our move away from the seismic leasing business.",
         "As you know, after receiving shareholder approval, we completed our reincorporation and rebranding last month formalizing changes to both our domicile and name. This change represents a major step in establishing a fresh and revitalized new identity for the company that more fully underscores our tremendous technological capabilities in the marine industry. It also represents a departure from our traditional seismic leasing business, which we have decided to exit entirely. We believe it also provides additional financing flexibility to enable us to navigate these uncertain times and pursue our growth objectives.",
         "Overall, the completion of this process marks an important time in the development and evolution of MIND Technology, and we have capitalized on this by rolling out a new corporate website that fully reflects our new identity. It goes without saying that we are excited and enthusiastic about the prospects of the company as we work to expand the presence of our marine products and services worldwide.",
         "Let me now turn the call over to Rob who will discuss our financial results in more detail. I will come back to add some closing comments before turning the call over for Q&A.",
         "Thanks Rob. ",
         "Based on our own visibility, the continuation of challenging economic fundamentals and restricted travel and activity regulations, we currently believe that the third quarter revenue levels for our marine technology product business will be comparable to the second. We do remain confident in the long term prospects for the business but timing of orders and near term activity remain uncertain. We will continue adapting to market conditions and focusing on operational execution and the advancement of our technology.",
         "As an example, I\u2019d like to highlight our latest effort to serve our customers and develop better and more cost efficient solutions to address market needs, that being the recently announced agreement with a major European defense contractor to jointly bring to market the next generation of synthetic aperture sonar systems, or SASS, for both commercial and military markets. This contractor has a recognized expertise in marine acoustic technology and the alliance will employ technologies previously developed by both parties. We believe that by combining the strength of our respective products, this will yield new and innovative solutions that better address the needs of the marine market for higher resolution imaging.",
         "SASS is an emerging technology that can help achieve these aims and vastly improve on the quality of an image produced by traditional side scan sonar. By leveraging our respective strengths, we believe we can bring products to market more quickly and increase the addressable market for our Klein sonar products as well.",
         "Our efforts to further the reach of our marine products don\u2019t end there, either. Despite lingering COVID restrictions and activity reductions, we have nonetheless been able to demonstrate the effectiveness of our technology for customers. For instance, there has been a good deal of activity with demonstrations of our Max and Micromax sonar technology to various groups in the U.S. Navy. Furthermore, we are also seeing more developments in the marine exploration market as many customers are requiring enhanced technical capabilities such as dual hydrophone capable source controllers. We believe our GunLink products are unique in their ability to provide this and other important capabilities. ",
         "These are all favorable signs for our future order flow and they also demonstrate how new product developments are opening doors to expanded opportunities for us. We plan to aggressively pursue the furtherance of our technology and products whether through internal development, acquisition or alliances. We also plan to expand the markets for our existing line of products and to focus on providing more value addition and higher return on investment.",
         "In conclusion, we see challenges in the market but we see opportunities as well. With our strong financial position of no debt, liquidity and access to additional capital, we have the solid foundation needed to overcome the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities. ",
         "With that, we will now open up the call for questions. "

         "Thank you Operator. Good morning and welcome to the MIND Technology fiscal 2021 second quarter conference call. We appreciate all of you joining us today.",
         "Your hosts are Rob Capps, co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and Guy Malden, co-Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President of Marine Systems.",
         "Before I turn the call over to management, I have the normal housekeeping details to run through. If you\u2019d like to listen to a replay of today\u2019s call, it will be available for 90 days via webcast by going to the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website at mind-technology.com, or you can listen via recorded instant replay until September 22, and information on how to access the replay features were provided in yesterday\u2019s earnings release.",
         "Information reported on this call speaks only as of today, Tuesday, September 15, 2020 and therefore you are advised that time sensitive information may no longer be accurate as of the time of any replay listening or transcript reading. ",
         "Before we begin, let me remind that certain statements made by management during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

         "Furthermore, as we start this call, please also refer to the statement regarding forward-looking statements incorporated in our press release issued yesterday, and please note that the contents of this call are covered by these statements.",
         "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Guy Malden. Guy?"

      "Operator": [
         "Greetings and welcome to the MIND Technology fiscal 2021 second quarter conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star, zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded",
         "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ken Dennard. Thank you, Mr. Dennard. You may begin."
      ],
      "Rob Capps": [
         "Okay, thanks Guy. I\u2019ll start by giving a more detailed review of the financial results, but before I proceed, I\u2019d like to highlight an important item that Guy touched on briefly. ",
         "Given the decision by management and the Board to exit the land seismic leasing business, the equipment leasing segment is now reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements. Therefore, the segment\u2019s results will be reported separately net of tax after continuing operations. In addition, the segment\u2019s assets and liabilities are now classified as held for sale and grouped separately on the balance sheet. You\u2019ll note that all prior periods have been restated to reflect these reclassifications.",
         "Let me first review the financial results of our continuing operations, which consist of our marine technology products business.",
         "For the second quarter, revenues from continuing operations totaled $5.1 million, down about 25% from $6.8 million in the second quarter a year ago, but up almost 60% from $3.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Seamap revenues were down year-over-year to $4.1 million in the quarter from $5 million in the year ago quarter, but were up 84% sequentially. Second quarter revenues from Klein were $1 million, a decrease from $1.8 million a year ago and down about 19% sequentially. ",
         "During the quarter, we did deliver a Sealink streamer system for installation on a vessel built for the Japanese coast guard; however as stated earlier, we believe the disruptions and uncertainty introduced by the COVID pandemic and other events have caused many customers to delay spending decisions and have introduced logistical challenges that have impacted our results. Let me give you an example of that.",
         "In the second quarter, we completed a Sealink-related order with a value of about $1.7 million; however, due to travel and shipping restrictions, the customer was unable to arrange shipment and take delivery of the system. Accordingly, we were unable to recognize that sale in the quarter, but we do expect to do so in the third quarter.",
         "Second quarter gross profit from continuing operations was $2 million, which was down from $2.8 million a year ago but up from $0.5 million dollars in Q1 of this year. This represents a gross profit margin of 40% which compares favorably to the 41% we achieved in last year\u2019s second quarter and well above the 15% achieved in the prior quarter this year. The increase in margins was a result of improved absorption of manufacturing overhead due to higher revenues.",
         "Our ongoing cost containment efforts continued to yield savings to our cost structure as our general and administrative expenses related to our continuing operations were $3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which is 12% lower year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially. Our research and development expense was $755,000, which was up 52% from a year ago and up 84% from the first quarter of this year. This is reflective of our ongoing technology and product development activities. ",
         "Our overall operating loss for the second quarter this year was $2.4 million as compared to an operating loss of $1.7 million posted in the year ago quarter and a $6.1 million loss in Q1 of this year. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $1.5 million compared to a loss of about $700,000 in last year\u2019s second quarter and a loss of $2.5 million in Q1 of this year.",
         "MIND\u2019s capital structure is debt free and liquidity remains solid. At the end of the quarter, we had over $22 million of working capital that included cash and cash equivalents of about $2.6 million. As we\u2019ve touched on before, our capital and cost structures are well suited to handle the continuing uncertainty of this environment. With no debt, we are free of the strictures and financial obligations of restricted covenants, which gives us significantly more flexibility and enhances the viability of the business should challenging conditions persist for an extended period of time. With our near term plans to monetize our leasing business as well as flexible cost structure, we are well positioned to navigate this environment and position ourselves for the eventual recovery.",
         "Though the shroud of market uncertainty remains, we do see a solid baseline of inquiries and requests for quotes. As Guy said, customer interest has been robust but this hasn\u2019t yet manifested in order activity due to both a more cautionary environment and the many restrictions and regulation present in the markets that we serve. As a result, our firm order backlog at $7.6 million at the end of the second quarter was down from the first quarter backlog of $10.2 million.",
         "With that, let me turn things back over to Guy for a few closing comments before we take your questions."

Is some of this, do you believe, tied into the fact that with the increasing use of autonomous underwater vehicles, the Navy is going to need to do a much more extensive mapping effort? I think a lot of people in this country forget that GPS exists so that air launched and sea launched cruise missiles could hit their targets, not so that you could find a department store or the grocery store, and it would seem that that need is probably even greater for autonomous underwater vehicles because you can\u2019t use traditional sensing, because of the way water transmits energy, and so they\u2019re going to have to map any hotspots pretty significantly and also pretty regularly, just to make sure that if they need to deploy underwater vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles, they can do so safely. Is that part of what you see as the need growing here, and it\u2019s why this is going to be such a great long term opportunity? "
