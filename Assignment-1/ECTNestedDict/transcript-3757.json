         "Thank you, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today on this call. Since we reported our Q1 results in early May, GMV trends have improved significantly, with May down approximately 19% year-on-year, June down 8% year-on-year, and importantly, we have continued the positive trend into July with GMV decreasing by only 2% year-on-year for the month. Our GMV recovery prompted us to begin reinvesting in growth in Q2 earlier than we previously anticipated. While Q2 was challenging, that pandemic has been a catalyst for reinvention and innovation at The RealReal. With the normalization of our processing capacity and the evolution of our supply acquisition strategy, we are now laser-focused on returning to sustained growth.",

Joining me today to discuss our results are Founder and CEO, Julie Wainwright; and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Gutske. Hopefully, you\u2019ve had chance to read our press release and stockholder letter that we distributed earlier today, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website.",

            "Hey, guys. It\u2019s Michael. Thanks for all the detail in the presentation today. So I want to focus on July for a minute. It sounds like GMV down 2%. Can you speak to some of the other underlying metrics that you gave us? What\u2019s driven the acceleration here? And it looks you\u2019re \u2013 I think last time we talked to you, you\u2019d anticipated that you crossed back in the positive territory at some point before the end of the year. It looks like there\u2019s a chance to do that this quarter. Is there any reason, be it tougher comps in July or anything like that, that you think there\u2019s some headwinds ahead that we should think about that would make not possible?"

            "I\u2019m going to start, and then I\u2019ll kick it over to Matt. We\u2019re really excited about July. Really what\u2019s happened is July \u2013 I mean, previously, in Q2, our business was suppressed, both by operating capacity at social unrest and also business not returning to normal. We\u2019re seeing that all change in July. Our stores opened in July later than we thought, but now we have all of our stores open. New York returned to growth in the month of July. L.A. is still lagging slightly due to increased COVID, but we expect that to continue. So regardless of comps last year, what we see in front of us is growth on GMV product coming in, which will then internally to do out in GMV. So I\u2019m looking over to Matt."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Thanks, Michael, for the question. So just to point out a couple of things that were in the shareholder letter. So you\u2019re right on GMV growth, that improved to negative 2% in the month of July. That was on supply growth that was plus 3% year-over-year. So we returned back to net growth in incoming supply. That is both of them \u2013 I mean they\u2019re obviously highly correlated. But the \u2013 in essence, the recovery is a bit steeper than we anticipated a quarter ago, and that\u2019s obviously a good thing.",
            "In terms of how we see it paying out over the next couple of months and through the fourth quarter, obviously, things are quite fluid, so to take everything with a grain of salt. But in the immediate term, we see July basically staying right around \u2013 Q3 staying right around the July level. To your point, we are lapping a very strong Q3 of 2019, where our GMV growth rate was up about 10%. So notwithstanding the comping difficulties, underlying that is just sort of steady underlying improvements, starting with supply. We do see a path to positive year-over-year growth in Q4 at this point."

      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Let me follow that, Matt. You guys do have a lot of your business in New York and LA, and you may have mentioned this in the PowerPoint, and I missed it, but the supply returning to positive, is that \u2013 I mean, did you get back to positive without much contribution from New York? I know a lot of your core consignor base is outside of the city and perhaps not \u2013 doesn\u2019t have access to their full closet at this point?",
            "And then I guess the last one is within the demand growth on GMV as you get to that negative 2% number in July. Are you seeing some of the components of that, that have been the headwinds like the UPT? It seems like to me, in April, you just didn\u2019t have the inventory for buyers to add a unit to the basket when they came to you and the supply improving, are you seeing UPT improve? Is that part of the help in getting to the negative 2% in July?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Michael Binetti"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So again, I\u2019ll start, and then I\u2019ll kick it over to Matt. Actually, New York had a positive comp on the year for the month of July, despite many of the New Yorkers out of \u2013 and the people living in Manhattan specific still not returning to the city. So we feel really good given the fact that we did grow in New York, despite that, that we are well positioned for growth when they do return. So supply was strong and showed rapid growth in some cities. Again, the only market that\u2019s lagging in the month of July was L.A., which we do expect to return as COVID actually subsides and people get more normalized in their day-to-day activity.",
            "On the UPT, I\u2019ll let Matt answer that specifically, but we do have an interesting phenomenon going on right now. On the product coming in, the average selling price for us is roughly the same if we would have gone to people\u2019s homes. The curbside pickup and the virtual appointments are working in that way. But in general, what people are purchasing are actually a higher value thing.",
            "So handbags and jewelry, in particular, along with home and art, are selling better than we would have anticipated and the lower value things like apparel, especially contemporary apparel, are lagging. So consequently, without a strong UPT because it has ticked up a little but isn\u2019t at where it was before it, too, our AOV actually gave us one of the best months in July that we\u2019ve ever had. And that again is a shift in the buying mix."

         "Speaker": "Julie Wainwright"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So you don\u2019t need to write this down. So I\u2019m just going to reiterate a couple of the numbers that are in the shareholder letter for clarity. So overall, supply was up 3%, New York for the month was down 1%, so basically flat. LA was down 11% versus being down 25% in the prior month. So improving as well. And that left everything else at positive 8% for the month. Some of that benefit does come from continuing strength in the vendor channel, but broad-based across all of the other regions, we are seeing a return to positive year-over-year comps.",
            "So then adding to what Julie is saying on unpacking AOV in essence. So ASP has been very strong throughout and has really recovered from where we were in April. Every month has increased and July was actually up 12% year-over-year. UPT or units per transaction has begun a recovery, but it\u2019s still substantially below pre-COVID levels, and we\u2019d expect that to continue until our overall available supply balance is back to positive year-over-year at some point and hopefully not-too-distant future. So AOV, as a result, is \u2013 the recovery has been as a result of ASP stabilizing and improving."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you. Hi, Julie. Hi, Matt. The supply detail is really helpful. It looks like New York bounced back a little more strongly sequentially than L.A. Do you \u2013 what do you expect for Q3, Q4 in terms of supply units? Do you think New York will stay \u2013 will turn positive? Is that underlying your views on Q4? And then will L.A. turn positive with negative 11% in July? And then bigger picture, will those two markets always be a large percentage of your supply dynamic over time? Would love your thoughts there."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Oliver Chen"
      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. So of course, we don\u2019t know with high levels of precision, but here\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing at a micro level for both of those markets. So New York, the recovery has been quite substantial. And I think I can \u2013 we can attribute some of it to what we\u2019re seeing, and you\u2019re living in New York that New York has done a comparatively good job at managing COVID and the city is slowly coming back to life, and our consignors are slowly coming back home. So we see that, and that\u2019s assisted by the opening of our stores a little over a month ago. That helps on the margin.",
            "So unless we see a change in those trends if COVID worsens, I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that New York will be back to positive year-over-year growth now for this quarter and strengthening into Q4. L.A. has sort of the flip side of that, where the area has done less well at managing the spread of COVID. In fact, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s getting progressively worse in California, particularly in Southern California. So no doubt, we\u2019re seeing that impact. Though even within that, we are seeing recovery. Again, our stores open there.",
            "So on the margin, that\u2019s helping. I think it will be too soon to say that whether L.A. can return to positive comps in Q3, unlikely, but I think a recovery broadly, I think we\u2019re comfortable with. And in terms of where they \u2013 those markets go long-term, we\u2019ve really \u2013 even in those markets which are most penetrated, we\u2019re still barely scratching the surface in consignor penetration and buyer penetration. So they will always be, I think, our largest markets, and they can continue to grow for many, many years to come. But certainly, they\u2019ll be our largest markets, but the rest of them have even more growth potential than they do."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. And you made a proactive strategic decision to reinvest in marketing starting in mid-May. Why was that the right time? And what kind of marketing comparisons are you up against? How are you thinking about managing marketing as we model that in the next quarter and look at the interplay between marketing relative to demand?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Oliver Chen"
      },
      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. I\u2019ll take that one. So I was clear by the time we got, frankly, by the time we got through April that we felt like the worst was sort of behind us, and we started our planning around what would it take to make us confident to start reinvesting in growth. The reopening \u2013 or not reopening, the loosening of restrictions in our Brisbane facility in very early May, I think we talked about on the last call, that was the big thing that gave us the confidence that we could process the units if we brought them in, in marketing ultimately is driving supply as well as demand.",
            "So once all of those things lined up, we felt that it was \u2013 we were comfortable to start leaning in a little bit, but in a relatively moderate way. And as we started to see the results in terms of traffic, in terms of supply rebuilding, then we just leaned more and more into it. Such that by the time we got through June, we were almost back to pre-COVID levels of spend, which is about $4 million to $5 million per month. Going forward, unless things change, that\u2019s what you should expect, $4 million to $5 million of marketing per month for the balance of the year."

Two questions, if I may, one follow-up on the investments you announced or you started early in Q2, what are kind of like the key areas of investment there? And just wanted to understand if and how your long-term investment priorities might have changed now with COVID? Thank you so much."

      },
      "19": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. They\u2019re definitely two different questions. So the first \u2013 so it\u2019s really a reversal of everything that we identified that we were going to pull back on operating expenses when COVID initially hit. So first and foremost was marketing. We just covered that kind of how we went down. Now we\u2019re kind of progressively building back up. Next was a variety of payroll-related expenses. We furloughed about 15% of our staff. We had a layoff of about 10% of our staff and various other things. We didn\u2019t give raises, suspended bonuses, et cetera. At this \u2013 we are building back. So there\u2019s almost no one left on furlough.",
            "And we have begun selectively rehiring across the business, particularly in our technology organization. It\u2019s been driving tremendous innovation for us. And most recently, in our sales organization. We\u2019re going to hire relatively aggressively in sales in the back half of the year to support our return to strong sustainable growth. So in terms of how that informs our priorities going forward, I would say there\u2019s no significant impact. I would point to the innovations that have come as a result of COVID that have been focused in our sales organization, having to reinvent our supply acquisition strategy altogether, leading into virtual appointments, adding in self-scheduling.",
            "So these are potential unlocks to sales productivity over time. So that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we invest more in sales, but we\u2019re getting the returns from our technology investment. So we feel kind of embolden to continue leading in there. But over time, I think what we\u2019re experiencing during COVID is that we see a path to potentially stronger unit economics longer term as a result of the efficiencies that we\u2019ve gained during COVID."

            "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two quickly for me. I guess, first, on the vendor side, you guys indicated that you had some strong success there. I think it was up close to 20% from an inventory perspective. I guess kind of what\u2019s the stability of that channel? Was it a short-term phenomenon? Or do you think you can continue to lean on that? And then second, in areas where you have reopened physical locations, I guess kind of what are you seeing both on the sell side and the buy side? Thanks."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. I\u2019ll start on vendor and then maybe, Julie, you can start with your thoughts on stores, and I\u2019ll chime in. So the vendor channel, as you mentioned, is doing well. So the GMV, I think is what you\u2019re referring to is up 19% year-over-year in the quarter. Our supply actually in vendors up a bit more than that. So that continues to be a comparatively strong channel for us, and we\u2019d expect to see that continuing certainly for the balance of this year and probably realistically, through next year, we\u2019ll remain at elevated levels, but not a focus, a strategic priority to grow that business at a much, much higher rate than it is.",
            "So it did tick up from mid \u2013 4%, 5% of GMV to about 8% of GMV in the quarter. We\u2019d expect it to be in that neighborhood, but maybe hitting 10%, but probably not much more than that. We do use it to strategically infill product, focused on higher-value products, particularly handbags, jewelry, watches, and that\u2019s the strategy there. So if you get the question on stores is what are we seeing so far, supply."

         "Remarks": [
            "So stores have been interesting because right when we opened, we were hit with some social and rest and had to shut down. So they\u2019ve been open now since about the third week of June. So early days, that is incredibly encouraging. It looks like right now, that in the month of July, they did about 80% of what they were doing pre-COVID, and we\u2019re getting an appointment for consignment and curbside dropoff or consignment was tracking pretty close to the demand.",
            "So we\u2019re encouraged by the stores. New York, in particular, has picked up. L.A. is picking up. Again, you got to remember, we only have four, but we are so encouraged by the stores that you can expect, we are going to open one more store before the end of the year. We had previously announced that we were going \u2013 that we had signed a lease to open a store in Chicago. And we are going to go ahead and open it to take advantage of the holiday selling season, which also is a great time for us to get consignment. That store will open sometime in November."

And then just be curious, are you seeing any kind of countercyclical benefits in any of the markets where maybe consumers are home or as they\u2019re obviously able to clear \u2013 spend more to clear out their closets. Are you starting to see some of that benefit at all right now as well? Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, we\u2019ll answer your first question second, maybe. So I think we might have to kind of get back to you on understanding that. I think the question on services revenue. I think just to remind everybody here, services revenue is kind of is all of the non \u2013 it\u2019s not the direct revenue and it\u2019s everything other than the take rate that we get on our consignment sales.",
            "So that\u2019s predominantly shipping. So there\u2019s no particular reason that would \u2013 that trend would have been markedly different. And then the other question, just general supply \u2013 I mean I wouldn\u2019t say that we can connect \u2013 we haven\u2019t certainly done consumer research to understand the motivation during COVID for people consigning, but our supply trends have been consistently more and more encouraging.",
            "So certainly, to some extent, that is \u2013 as people settle into their stay at home routines, they are cleaning up closets and doing that. We\u2019re seeing broad-based strength until recently, we weren\u2019t seeing that in our largest markets of New York and Los Angeles. Starting to see that now. There\u2019s a case to be made that once new Yorkers come back, that there could be quite a strong rebound and the surge of supply coming out of New York for the reason of that dynamic that you mentioned. But broadly, I think the interest in consignment is strong, and our value proposition is even stronger in times where value wins. And certainly, the times we\u2019re in are that."

We saw that happening earlier, this more of a COVID effect. So I don\u2019t see that our mix should change dramatically. So our take rate more or less, I think, is going to be stable in Q3. Maybe we\u2019re going to mix up even a bit more because then you\u2019re going to have the COVID impact compounded by what people traditionally buy in the holiday season anyway.

I\u2019m not sure what else is going on, on the expense side.

The way we\u2019re thinking about reinvesting right now, and it\u2019s not directly one for one. Once we saw the positive signs, our primary focus moved to supporting the growth. Yes, for this year to support a strong close to the year in Q3, Q4. But most importantly, to set us up for a very strong 2021. And so we\u2019re going to continue leaning into that. The effect of that is with the GMV upside that we\u2019re seeing is what we thought a quarter ago, that GMV upside will pay for most of the reinvestment that we\u2019re making this year. But we\u2019ll generate strong GMV underpinnings for strong next year that can lead to accelerated operating margin gains, which we\u2019ll update as we get closer to that."

So when we refer to our vendor channel, all that really means is that those are businesses who are selling to us but are consigning with us. Lion\u2019s share of that inventory is still same model. It\u2019s a consignment model with take rates, et cetera. So there\u2019s no difference in terms of how it\u2019s recognized to the financial statements. No inherent differences in return rates, so the mix of products we tend to get to the vendor channel skews more toward bags and watches, and they have their own return characteristics. And they\u2019re generally speaking, higher ASP products than what come from individuals. But again, it\u2019s relatively small.",
            "And then in terms of what \u2013 we do have a very small business where we buy upfront, and that\u2019s not limited to the vendor sellers. We offer that alongside our consignment offering to encourage people to consign. And typically, what we\u2019re doing that is in \u2013 mostly in handbags, a little bit in sneakers, a little bit in some jewelry. And we just present consignors in our physical locations with options of consign at this rate, get a trade for site credit at this rate or get cash upfront at this rate. And the majority of time people choose the consignment option because they\u2019re willing to wait to get the highest payout. So we find it as a good lever for us to convert consignors."

So supply, generally speaking, is a leading indicator for our GMV so the supplier metrics that we\u2019re giving out, we\u2019re not necessarily going to continue doing that. But because things are so fluid, we felt that the transparency was appropriate at this point, is shipped units, which is just basically means that our consignor, our salespeople have \"shipped\" one of these units into our facilities, then it takes \u2013 there\u2019s a certain amount of time it takes to process those and then turn in \u2013 ultimately turn into sales.",
            "So generally speaking, it\u2019s a leading indicator, number one. Two, our supply has been down substantially year-over-year for a few months now, means that we\u2019ve had to sell more aggressively into older inventory. So as supply starts to rebuild and gets into a significantly positive year-over-year territory, then you can start to see where that trend starts to change, and we\u2019re selling more of our GMV coming from newly released products onto our marketplace, and they\u2019ll tend to correlate pretty well in a steady state. But in a \u2013 from month-to-month, you\u2019re going to tend to see supply trends lead GMV."

Just not enough data there, but we\u2019re optimistic that we could see substantial productivity improvements from our sales team is virtual \u2013 the reality is virtual is the new norm. Virtual appointments with curbside pickup, supported by our growing fleet of vans and more recently, assisted by the launch of consignor self-scheduling, all those three things fit together to lead to a scenario where we could have substantially greater number of appointments per day per salesperson than in the model where they were traveling in between appointments.",
            "So prior to COVID, a good day for a salesperson is four or five appointments a day. With the restrictions of logistics, you could see that increase substantially. So we look forward to the point where we\u2019re pushing some volume, so much consignment through that we can report out on realized productivity gains, but we definitely see the potential for it to be an unlock in our model that we weren\u2019t really anticipating as recently as a quarter ago."

So have you been able to resume any in-home appointments in any location? Or do you have any plans to do so in the near future? And then on virtual appointments, I know that you mentioned that the number of items consigned virtually is generally a lot lower compared to in home. Have you guys seen a trend of increasing number of items? And then also maybe the margin impacts on that."

We have \u2013 prior to COVID, we had inside sales and we had white glove and inside sales really with us sending the shipping label for someone descended in and we get roughly five to six units an item when they send it in, virtual and appointments we went or were in more like 15 to 18 units for pickup. Our virtual appointments with curbside pickup, where we send a van, look just like our white glove appointment. So \u2013 and interestingly enough, the value of those in \u2013 of the units from the virtual appointment to the curbside pickup is exactly the same. So the combination of the van pickup with the virtual is working just like the in-home consultation.",
            "So right now, it looks like a really efficient trade-off to keep on moving forward. We do expect, as we move forward, that some consignors, especially because there\u2019s quite often we\u2019ll get people going through big changes, where we\u2019ll pick up 200 to 1,000 things at one pickup. That in-home appointments will return, we would be getting these huge pickups again, but not \u2013 most likely not this year, but sometime next year. So we\u2019re leaving that option open, but virtual right now, virtual plus curbside pickup is almost \u2013 it looks like a more efficient and effective trade-off to white glove appointments."

We\u2019ve chosen and our consignors have broadly speaking, chosen not to at this point because the virtual appointments are working well. There\u2019s really \u2013 we\u2019re not finding that there\u2019s any difficulty or lack of comfort using the technology. They\u2019re converting well. So everybody is happy with it. But as we go forward, I think some more in-home is certain to Julie\u2019s point, is certain to come back into the mix, but I don\u2019t personally see a scenario where it goes back the way that it was where we have the majority of our products coming from in-home appointments.

On July, the GMV, very \u2013 almost breakeven. Did you comment at all on the linearity of GMV growth in the month \u2013 was there actually any period of time where EMV actually broke positive? We\u2019d love to get some additional color on that? And then secondly, I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re \u2013 if you have seen in the four or so months that we\u2019ve been in locked down if you\u2019ve commented forgive me again, but are you seeing a normally large growth in your \u2013 in the number of consignors? And relatedly, any noticeable change in the motivation for people consigning? Is it related to economic distress? Or is it the normal reasons? That would be great."

But yes, I mean, technically speaking, there were periods in the month where we were seeing positive year-over-year comps, but there\u2019s a lot of reasons that can happen, including what day of the week is different, the timing of our promotional cadences, et cetera. So it\u2019s actually \u2013 I don\u2019t find it particularly helpful to granulate even further than what we did on a monthly basis.",
            "Going forward in the \u2013 at least for the rest of this quarter, from a growth rate perspective, I\u2019m not expecting that same type of linear improvement because we\u2019re comping a very strong Q3 of 2019 that we saw about 10 points of GMV acceleration. So holding right around this level is, in effect, continuance of our recovery. We do expect to see continuing supply strengthening which will support a reacceleration from a growth pay perspective in both GMV and supply in the fourth quarter as we currently see it.",
            "And then your other question around just motivation. There was a question earlier around just kind of motivations of consignors and just kind of strength of new consignors, buyers, et cetera. I would say there\u2019s no real trends that we can draw. We\u2019ve always benefited from a very strong, highly engaged base of buyers and consignors. We were spending very little on marketing. It was really our base that carried us through. And as we\u2019ve started to reengage and invest more in marketing, we\u2019re starting to see recovery in new consignors and new buyers as well.

And there\u2019s a different phenomenon, and it\u2019s mostly on apparel. It\u2019s a different phenomenon happening this year. Apparel is \u2013 women\u2019s apparel, specifically, has lessened as a percent of our mix by just a few points, but handbags, fine jewelry and hand bags, in particular, fine jewelry, man, home and art actually have grown. Consequently, we haven\u2019t overall seen any promotional effect. The other thing that\u2019s happening in the again, the online businesses, which are primarily the department stores is that they are selling through inventory that is more \u2013 less fresh and more old and perhaps not as unique.",

So there\u2019s still a bigger gap. The other thing, I think, of note is our ASP in July went up 12% versus the same period a year ago.

But I have to say the only market that\u2019s been negatively impacted for us is L.A. The other markets are really still growing. And I really believe that\u2019s because of the safety measures we put in place where \u2013 we where it is a curbside pickup with the virtual appointment. So the appointments, people are willing to consign and wanting to consign. Actually, there\u2019s very little human touch with that, and they feel very safe consigning.",
            "And so we feel that, that will continue. L.A. just really needs to be a turnaround. We did have a double whammy there. We had social unrest. We had our store closure, and then we had our office closure. And LA has seen a resurgence in COVID. So that one\u2019s a little harder to predict but even in July, it already started to look better. So there\u2019s that. Now the second part of the question."

So let\u2019s just say that COVID put a change in plans, but I expect that the relation \u2013 a couple of relationships will emerge shortly."
