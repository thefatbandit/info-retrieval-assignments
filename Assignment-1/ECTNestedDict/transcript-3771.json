      "David Smetana": [
         "Thanks, Nick. We reported core FFO per share for the quarter of $0.28 versus $0.40 in the prior year. To provide some perspective in the absence of formal guidance, the results of each division were roughly in line with heavily revised down expectations that we began to flow through our models in May.",
         "We had inline office results as we anticipated increase credit write-downs and benefited again from having very low lease expirations. And we had slightly lower than anticipated multifamily results that included a $944,000 write-off related to a corporate apartment operator.",
         "In total, there were 4.2 million of credit charges in the quarter or $0.04 per share, including the $944,000 charge related to the corporate housing provider. 2.2 million of the charges related to reserve analysis and two million related to straight line rent receivables.",
         "The strength we saw in rent collections when we presented that NAREIT in early June of 96% in our office portfolio, and 97% in multifamily carried through as a rough averages for the quarter. In July, we have collected 98% of office rents and 99% on the multifamily side.",
         "The slight increase is attributable to the hard work of leasing and operations teams have done to appropriately give a limited number of modifications or deferrals were needed, and getting tenants back on a normal payment cadence.",
         "While our exposure to hotel operations which were 4% of revenues in Q1 and parking operations, which are currently 3% of revenues on models. They were disrupted in line with our expectations.",
         "For parking, we think the second quarter run rate of $3 million is a conservative way to think about the second half of the year. But remain hopeful that in the fourth quarter as people return to work, they will be more apt to drive and park with us.",
         "Our hotel operations remain limited to the residence in portion of our dual flag Port Imperial hotels. That hotel contributed $960,000 EBITDA loss in the second quarter. We continue to believe the hotel recovery will be slow and do not plan to reopen the EnVue in Imperial and the Hyatt in Jersey City until the fourth quarter at best, and thus we recommend using the current quarter as a run rate until further notice.",
         "Our office cash same-store NOI increased by 13.4% in the second quarter, as we continue to receive the benefits of our of our major blend and extend leases at Harbourside, now cash flowing over prior periods but still had pre-rent provisions. This will however moderate in the second half.",
         "GAAP same-store NOI was done by 3.6% with $1.3 million of straight line rent reserves in our same-store pool, creating a negative 5% drag on GAAP same-store NOI. We have $1 million of credit reserves allowances, and 1.8 million of straight line rent reserves across the entire office portfolio, including our discontinued operations.",
         "In the office segments, we originally gave guidance that included 135,000 square feet of waterfront leasing for the year. To-date, we assigned 105,000 square feet of transactions on the waterfront with another 18,000 in leases today. Given the current operating environment, we do not assume any further speculate new leasing to take occupancy between now and the end of the year in our internal projections.",
         "To reiterate what Nick said for the remainder of the year, we have over 118,000 square feet expiring in our suburban portfolios, of which 91,000 square feet pertain to assets that are under contract to be sold this year. Of the 27,000 square feet remaining in our suburban portfolio, we expect 20,000 square feet to renew in the coming quarters.",
         "Touching briefly on the multifamily results, residential same-store NOI, which Marshall has already given great detail on was done 5% for the quarter, when excluding a $944,000 write down related to a corporate housing provider. We expect incentives to remain elevated as we seek to rebuild occupancy.",
         "Now on the transaction side. Our Parsippany & Giralda Farms portfolio sale has been restructured for a gross price of $272 million a 4% discount to the original purchase price of $285 million.",
         "The first phase of 11 properties was contract for $167 million. In July, the first property three- Giralda apartments closed for $8 million, leaving 10 of the 11 properties in phase one, scheduled to close at the end of the third quarter for the remaining $159 million.",
         "The second phase under contract for $105 million is for four of the 15 remaining properties with these closing scheduled to take place in the fourth quarter. For the Monmouth, Short Hills and Metropark portfolios, we believe the timing of the sale is very hard to predict and see closings taking place either late in the fourth quarter or early in 2021. In addition to the Parsippany and Dorado portfolio sale, we currently have three properties including 111 River, totaling 833,000 square feet under contract for closing by year-end.",
         "On our annual lease schedule which we published quarterly, while we are cognizant of the fact that price discovery is challenging in this environment. We are trying to do our best to make sure our assumptions are reflective of what we are seeing operationally and whether is buyer interest reflective of where pricing may end up.",
         "We took a 3% discount to our multifamily NAV in the quarter, given the uncertainty of NOI growth, but also reflective of a healthy multifamily financing market at record low rates. Notably, we took a 6% haircut to our unlevered Waterfront asset value and some reductions in land value for a 7.4% total hit to office NAV and a 7.1% hit to total NAV. ",
         "Turning to the balance sheet. We have no debt maturities in 2020. And in July, as Marshall mentioned, we place a deposit and rate locked at 2.9% refinancing of our only major 2021 property level maturity, a $165 million multifamily loan on Monaco with its existing lender. We expect to close this mortgage in November avoiding prepayment penalties.",
         "The net debt to EBITDA metric was 13.0 times at quarter end. The metric remains elevated as we carry all of the multifamily debt and no EBITDA benefit. We expect this metric to improve as we have four multifamily development properties that will begin contributing to EBITDA within the next 12-months to 24-months, including the [Emy] (Ph) which opened in Q1 2020. Additionally, the metric was negatively affected and increased by 1.3 turns from negative hotel and parking impacts.",
         "Lastly, I\u2019m pleased to say today as we sit here today, we only have $5 million of equity left to fund on our current CIP pipelines, all relating to our 750 units project called the Charlotte in Jersey City. We know what we in for construction portion of all five development projects totaling $1 billion in construction costs with a projected 6.2% stabilized yield.",
         "With that, I will turn the call back to the operator to open it up for questions."

         "Thank you operator. I would like to remind everyone that certain information discussed on this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Law. Although we believe the estimates reflected in these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we cannot give assurance that the anticipated results will be achieved. We refer you to the Company\u2019s press release, annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for risk factors that impacts the Company.",
         "With that, please allow me to introduce MaryAnne Gilmartin, Mack-Cali Board Chair and Interim Chief Executive Officer. Go ahead, MaryAnne."
      ],
      "Marshall Tycher": [
         "Thanks Marianne. In the second quarter, Roseland\u2019s percentage lease finished at 92.6% as compared to 95.7% last quarter. The reduction was primarily result of the dramatic decline in new lease traffic in the quarter due to COVID-19. We believe the client occupancy and reduction in new release traffic is consistent with other Northeast office portfolios and substantial portion of our comps.",
         "Despite the traffic reduction, our portfolio experienced a 58% retention rate, 300 basis points higher than 2019 and renewal rates on retained leases grew 2.8%. In July, net leasing activity turned positive, we believe the worst is behind us.",
         "In the quarter our same-store portfolio experienced a 10.2% decrease in NOI generated by a 5.2% loss in revenue. On a year-to-date basis the same-store NOI is negative 0.6%. The quarterly loss includes a one-time $944,000 write down from a single corporate - acquirer in Jersey city.",
         "Absent that write off, our same to our portfolio, would be negative 5% for the quarter and positive 2.1% for the year. Subsequent quarter-end we reached a settlement with that provider and retrieved 71 of their furnished units. We are evaluating alternatives to capitalize on these furnished units now.",
         "We continue to deliver a high level of service to our residents during the COVID period. Our staff has been on site and responsive they have increased the quality and quantity of daily cleanings across the portfolio. And we have enhanced our residence lifestyle by scheduling virtual programming, implementing door-to-door deliveries and introducing additional dining options.",
         "In regards to our hotel properties at Port Imperial, the [OnView] (Ph) was closed at the end of March and remains closed today. However, the residence in continue operate finished the quarter with an average occupancy of 70%. In Late June we activated OnView\u2019s 15,000 square foot patio for dining, which has been averaging $100,000 in weekly sales and its comfortable rooftop with that setting.",
         "The company has five projects representing 1942 units in construction which are projected to generate $62 million of stabilized NOI on a development yield of 6.15%. Moreover, as of now, we only have a $5 million capital obligation remaining to complete this portfolio.",
         "The Emory in Massachusetts, as delivered its initial 240 of 326 units. As July 27th, we have leased 81% of delivered units at rents in excess of our initial pro forma. The balance of the units will be completed by quarters end.",
         "Roseland preparing lease up activities at three projects for initial deliveries in early 2021,Port including 673 units in Port Imperial at both Capstone and River House 9 and in Epson Ashore Hills 193, a unit luxury community one of New Jersey\u2019s premier municipalities adjacent to the Short Hills Mall.",
         "Our fifth project the Charlotte to schedule the delivery in the first quarter of 2022. This development is 750 units tower located in Jersey City Waterfront submarket, on Christopher Columbus Drive, which will benefit from a below market pilot of 6% to 7% for 20-years.",
         "The construction activities are proceeding at a near standard pace. As a result of COVID-related delays, we have revised our supplemental schedules to capital on average 90-day delivery delays. Subsequent to quarter end we reached agreement to refinance our largest 2021 maturity having locked a seven year interest only $165 million mortgage at 2.9% for Monica.",
         "Looking at we are continuing predevelopment activities on three potential Hudson River stars including, Harborside 8, a 678 unit highly amenitized tower which will be adjacent to our corporate headquarters here in Harborside 3.",
         "The Park Parcel at Port Imperial, a 302-unit mid rise development to be constructed overlooking a 17-acre City Park with unencumbered 273 Views of Manhattan, and then the second phase of Urby, a proposed 796-unit tower adjacent to our successful Urby project, the highest rents per square foot in Jersey City.",

         "Thank you, Deidre. Good morning, and thank you for joining Mack-Cali\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Today I plan to provide a few opening remarks and will then pass the call to our leadership team.",
         "Marshall Tycher, Chairman of our multifamily platform Roseland, will walk us through some performance highlights. Nicholas Hilton, our Executive Vice President of Leasing will discuss our office operations and David Smetana, our chief financial officer will discuss our key financial metrics, and then we will open up the call for questions.",
         "We have also filed a supplemental this quarter that is located on the investor relations section of our website. Please contact David Smetana with any further questions.",
         "I was recently appointed to my role as Interim CEO by the Board of Directors. And with just a few weeks on the job, I will keep my remarks brief. But let me start by thanking my Mike DeMarco for his years of service to Mack-Cali.",
         "I\u2019m extremely excited to have been asked by my fellow Board Members to step in to lead Mack-Cali as the Board works to identify a new permanent CEO. Certainly these are unprecedented times and I recognize that there remains an era of uncertainties within executive change, amid a challenging health care crisis and what that may bring. I do not take that lightly.",
         "I Joined McNally\u2019s Board following the 2019 Annual Meeting, and was appointed Board Chair in June. I have spent the entirety of my career developing and operating, innovative, mixed use real estate projects in the New York Region. I love real estate and believe in the importance our sector plays in the lives of Americans every day.",
         "Well, my tenure as CEO is only temporary. I\u2019m deeply committed to ensure we continue to execute on the plans currently in place, which remain highly focused on collecting rents, leasing our properties and competing asset sales that are underway. I also plan to continue in my role as Chair after the Board selects a new CEO. ",
         "Over the coming months, I will complete a tour of all of our assets. And we will be spending time with all of our team members in the field. I\u2019m committed to providing stability, continuity and empowerment within the organization to be accountable and aligned with reaching our strategic objectives.",
         "And as the Board Chair, I have direct insight into the priorities of the Board from an overall strategic perspective, managed to spend a considerable amount of time listening to our shareholders and evaluating the business.",
         "One of the significant takeaways in the Board is in clear alignment with shareholders is that the Company is unlikely to realize maximum value in its current structure. Consequently, the Board is actively continuing to pursue value maximization strategy.",
         "In fact, even though in the short six weeks they have been in place, sell of the company suburban assets, which are continuing have been amongst the highest priorities. However, given the pandemic, we are not in a position to provide a definitive timeline for when they will be completed.",
         "The Board is committed to unlocking value and is squarely focused on the pursuit of the right strategic alternatives for the Company or to accomplish its objective. Those efforts are well underway and does not require nor are we waiting for the hiring of a new CEO to the head if appropriate.",
         "I\u2019m excited to build upon Mack-Cali\u2019s accomplishments, support our operational excellence and paves the way for success at every level of the Company. I work with Tycher and Dave to meet our shareholders and analysts and look forward to reporting on our progress each quarter.",
         "With that, I will turn the call over to Marshall to discuss our multifamily operations."
      ],
      "Nicholas Hilton": [
         "Thank you Marshall. Before I get into our leasing results, I would like to quickly touch upon our continued response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. All the protocols discussed in my last quarter\u2019s remarks have been implemented portfolio wide, including increased and expanding cleaning procedures, augmented ingress and egress plans to limit crowding, limited elevator capacity and mandatory mask use in common areas.",
         "We take the health and safety of our tenants, co-workers and operations staff very seriously. Together with our property management team, we continue to take all the necessary precautions to ensure a safe, secure and clean environment as the tri state area becomes to transitioning into the re-entry phase. We have also kept all of our buildings open and operational for our tenants throughout this crisis.",
         "From a new leasing perspective, we continue to make progress portfolio wide, signing just over 155,000 square feet in the second quarter. This resulted in our core and Waterfront portfolio finishing at a point 80.3% leased a quarter end. Of these transactions approximately 6% or 10,000 square feet were new leases, and 94% or 145,000 square feet were in place renewals. Across all four markets, our rents on second quarter leasing rolled up 3.6% on a cash basis and 12.9% on a GAAP basis.",
         "To turn to our focus to the specific markets the Waterfront closed approximately 55,000 square feet of transactions, finishing the second quarter at 78.6% leased. We are pleased to see increases of 8.5% on a cash basis and 18.6% on a GAAP basis over these yields.",
         "While the pandemic has paused many of our discussions, we still have approximately 200,000 square feet of transactions currently in negotiations across a diverse tenancy mix, including technology, financial services and insurance. Looking head we have a limited amount of lease roll with just over 54,000 square feet expiring on the Waterfront through the end of the year.",
         "Turning to the performance of our suburban portfolio. In the second quarter, we executed over 101,000 square feet while achieving positive rent increases of 1.2% on a cash basis and 10.3% on a GAAP basis.",
         "For the remainder of the year, we have over 118,000 square feet expiring in our suburban portfolio, of which approximately 91,000 square feet pertain to assets that are under contract to be sold by year\u2019s end subject any unforeseen delays from the pandemic, and of the remaining 27,000 square feet roll in, we expect renewal approximately 20,000 square as we move ahead.",

Maybe availability rate is really hovered around 20% in the market and average asking rents are probably ticked down about 3%.",

Is it just that you are on the job too early or is the strategic focus on suburban dispositions and getting to 60/40 in Waterfront focus?

I know there were a couple of large leases that got done which might have slipped through your fingers. I mean, how competitive was that leasing situation? And I guess with that building now leased up I guess, how do you feel about leasing up, Harbourside at this point?"

            "Thanks, Steve. Yes, so I will address both deals, right. So we were one of two in both instances. For the Merck transaction, also sometimes referred to as the we work transaction. The tenant really had a firm occupancy timing. And that was just really based on some things happening within their own business.",
            "And 30 Hudson offer to build solution for them. And while Harborside 5 was going to be built from raw condition, we offered solutions to mitigate the cost differential. I think, at the end of the day, though, the execution risk was still too great in this any other timing, due to any unforeseen delays from COVID.",
            "And as we look at the AIG big deal, again, we were one of two, we had a perfect block right in the middle of the stack. They were and are a tenant within our portfolio so negotiations are moving quite well. Midway though, midway through the lease the requirement grew, they grew out of that block and to accommodate them in the building we split them over to elevator banks just wasn\u2019t favorable. So, they focused their efforts at 30 Hudson and wrapped up the deal there.",

            "So, to say the building is for sure wrapped up. I\u2019m not going to say that outright. Anything is possible, but for right now, I\u2019m happy to at least consider that building having a bow on it. I think that it does speak to our ability to be in front of the right tenants.",

And given the fact that we have a lot of different types of products right in the same area, different size floor place, different pricing structures. I like our odds moving forward."

            "Thank you operator. I would like to conclude with a comment on leadership through change and challenge. Many of my career milestones have been imbued in through crises. After 9/11. I led the construction and leasing of the first two new office buildings in New York to rise after the attacks of 9/11, one in Brooklyn for Empire BlueCross BlueShield, which sustained significant loss of life and space on World Trade Centre.",
            "In Times Square post 9/11, I led the construction separately New York Times Tower, faced with the industry deemed to be an undesirable locations marked by the terrorist target across from the Port Authority sitting atop 11 subway lines. Yet we achieved record breaking rents in record time on the highest tower floors, which the industry said would be shunted after the attacks.",
            "In lower Manhattan, I led the team of finance, built and leased over 900 rental units at New York by Geary through the 2007 banking crisis, when experts wrote off the multifamily market in New York City, on the heels of the Great Recession, I stepped in to lead the restructuring and recapitalization of Pacific Park, Brooklyn, and lease thousands of units after it was plagued by delay and litigation.",
            "Post super storm Sandy, my recent team in Brooklyn was able to capitalize on downtown Brooklyn separate power grids, quality infrastructure, and high sea level coordinates, in short, I\u2019m good in the crisis. And while in modern times we have never been through anything quite like a global pandemic, I will lead with my strengths, which included empowerment, problem solving and execution.",
            "In closing, for sure, today, we find ourselves in an exceptionally challenging environment that is fraught with change and uncertainty. But in the face of it all, what will remain constant is the team\u2019s focus, suburban disposition, Waterfront leasing and strengthening the balance sheet. The team and I are fully engaged and we will look forward to continuing to speak to you all in the coming weeks.",
            "Please stay safe and healthy. Thank you and have a great day."
