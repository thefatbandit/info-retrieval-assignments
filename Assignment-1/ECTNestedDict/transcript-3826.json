I guess my first question is, during Q2 were there any changes in how clients were interacting with the company's products and services and were there any changes in clients or potential clients behavior?"

So in the second quarter after \u2013 in the first quarter we had the pandemic in China, many clients could not meet in person. So during this time we did develop the habit of using our online platforms more, especially our data products. So this is especially prevalent also for those who had signed up for trials of our products during this period for their ultimate decision making.",
            "For example, clients who need to effectively [ph] and cannot use domestic travel they will use our land database and SaaS tools to assess and evaluate land online and make relevant decisions and estimations. In the second quarter they were still some restrictions on travel and they had used our products more often and frequently. So in terms of habits of our clients, these were some of our observations."

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, I'll translate your question. Okay so I will now translate Ms. Huang's response. So in terms of helping growth, the pandemic as mentioned before has made our clients develop a habit of using our online tools, whether that is our databases or SaaS tools. So they are definitely more reliant on our online products and we have also put in place more training to help our clients be accustomed to using these online platforms.",
            "In terms of negative aspects, we used to have no bad debts in the past and now we see our bad debt have increased very slightly, and this is a result of an extension of the payment schedule by our clients. So, also in terms of global and Chinese economy, there are definitely uncertainties, including the potential of a second wave in the fall or winter. This will have an impact on the economy as a whole, but also impact us as well. Relatively speaking, the impact will be less since we have our online databases and SaaS tools compared to the rest of the economy. However, we will still experience an impact. Thank you."

We see restrictions being loosened in this area. This was also mentioned in the government meetings earlier this year to open up the market in this sector. For CIH we do have a strong database foundation and this is also our competitive advantage.",
            "Based on this and our real estate industry understanding and experience, credit ratings will help real estate appraisals and related financial industry services. And so we hope through these acquisitions to introduce new products and services to meet the requirements of risk assessment in the real estate sector, as well as the financial services sector. And for the future, we hope to bring in revenue based on these new products and services. Thank you."

And the question was whether this was due to COVID or for example, the transactions with Fang. The response is there are certainly impacts from COVID, since promotions were slowed or postponed during the pandemic, especially in Q1 and to a certain extent in Q2. And I mentioned earlier, we did have some delays in payment by a few clients resulting in a slightly increase in bad debt.",

And the response is, during the pandemic, we did increase our promotions for our online products and tools. So this is from our efforts from the first quarter. Additionally, our clients as well may significant efforts to improving their side of the business and as a result, we see basically our receivables increasing. Thank you."
