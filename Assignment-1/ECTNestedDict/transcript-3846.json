      "Antonio V\u00e1zquez": [
         "Good morning. This is Antonio V\u00e1zquez. Welcome to the results presentation of IAG. I will give you a few words of introduction before handing over to Willie. This has been certainly the worst quarterly results in our history and COVID-19 has been the worst event to have affected the aviation industry. This morning, we announced a planned capital increase of up to \u20ac2.75 billion which the management team will take you through.",
         "This will be my last results meeting as IAG Chairman. Following a very thorough and robust succession planning, I intend to chair the Board for the remainder of 2020 and then retire early in January. After nine years as Chairman of IAG and two years before as the CEO and Chairman of Iberia, it is time to hand over the reins. The new Chairman will be Javier Ferr\u00e1n, currently a non-executive director of IAG and also Chairman of Diageo. Javier and I have worked together over the last year and I have every confidence that he is the right person to take the group forward. It has been for me a privilege to have led the IAG Board since the group was formed from the merger of British Airways and Iberia in January 2011 and I'm fully confident that our previous achievements put us in a very good position to face the industry's current crisis.",
         "Before I hand over to the management, I would like to thank Willie for all the year who has been leading the management team and specifically for delaying his retirement to enable the IAG management team to remain in their roles, to deal with the initial impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. I look forward to welcoming Luis Gallego as the CEO from September. His proven track record in transforming business and his great leadership will certainly drive the group to a new era.",
         "With that in mind, and -- I will hand over to Willie. Thank you."
      ],
      "Luis Gallego": [
         "Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. As Willie mentioned at the beginning of the presentation, IAG has a proven and successful business model and we have delivered a strong profitability and strong returns during all these years. Also it's important that we have arrived to this crisis in a strong financial position.",
         "We have a unique structure. We have weekly meetings with the 6 OPCO CEOs and 6 IAG Senior Managers and we share best practices and we make decisions in the best interest of the overall group. I think this has been very helpful in all of these crises. Our portfolio of brands diversifies our exposure to our individual market, countries and customer segments.",
         "And this is an opportunity to participate in the early recovery of the domestic, short haul and leisure demand as currently we are seeing in Iberia and Vueling. We can also leverage our consolidation track record and our global leadership position in Europe and North Atlantic and Latin America routes to take advantage of any dislocations in the sector in the aftermath of this crisis.",
         "We also have strategic and operational freedom because unlike our major European competitors, we don't have constraints by the government. So we can make acquisitions. We are able to pay dividends to the shareholders. We already have as you know a very competitive cost structure which we are sure we can improve further with the restructuring process that we have across the group over the coming months and into 2021.",
         "And also we are working very hard improving our innovation capabilities which are going to be critical as demand recovers and competition intensifies coming out of the crisis. Talking about the customers, the biggest challenge that we have for the airline industry now is to get people booking and flying again. Customers need to be able to book with confidence knowing that they can get their money back should their flights be canceled. And they need to be confident that they will be safe when traveling by air both on the ground and in the air.",
         "I'm not going to cover all these measures that you have in the slide, but we have a lot of examples of what the group airlines are doing to encourage customers to make bookings and to demonstrate that they will be safe from COVID-19 and they will enjoy their experience when traveling. This is especially important because we don't intend to close off seats to booking and we need to operate flights with high utilization in order to maximize positive cash flow as we return the operations to normal.",
         "Pre-travel, we are using promotions in order to tempt leisure travelers. We are allowing date changes without penalty. And we have partnered also with insurance companies to provide travel cover in case you contract COVID-19 or are disrupted due to the re-imposition of border restrictions, while traveling.",
         "Each airline has several videos that you can see in the different websites which demonstrates what to expect at the airport and when you are onboard the aircraft. At the airport we encourage minimal contact with the staff by using self-service check-in and self-boarding gates and contactless security as much as possible. There will be also temperature screenings on departure and on arrivals.",
         "All staff and passengers must wear face coverings at all times at the airport and in the air. All aircraft are clean and sanitized each night, as well as in between the flights and so on. These are only just examples. There are plenty of other detailed procedures that we do in order to protect the health and safety of all our passengers.",
         "If we talk about the demand recovery. We see early signs of demand recovery especially in the domestic and in the short haul. We have seen customer bookings rise since the middle of May as the chart that you can see shows. This slide shows weekly booking trends for all the airlines in the group since March as a proportion of last year's levels. They are based on passenger volumes and you have examples. So for example in domestic Spain that is the 11th largest domestic air travel market in the world, and you can see the recovery that we are having there. With exception of longhaul bookings, they have risen each week with some recent leveling off.",
         "Domestic Spain, as I said before, has the strongest recovery with bookings currently running on 50% of last year's levels. 24% of our passengers last year were on domestic flights, but only 7% of RPKs were there.",
         "Other shorthaul bookings are currently running at around 30% of last year's rates. International shorthaul represents for us 25% of the total RPK traffic. However, it's true that there has been a slight flattening in the domestic and shorthaul bookings in the last two weeks due to the increase in new COVID-19 cases in Spain. And we are also mindful of the U.K.'s decision on 26th of July to re-impose a 14-day quarantine period for arrivals from Spain.",
         "Longhaul bookings are still the weakest running around 20% of last year's rates. And there has not been an improvement since mid-June reflecting the problems that we are having in the U.S. and Latin America markets.",
         "Moving to the next slide. We are reviewing the capacity for the rest of the summer season and the upcoming winter season on a weekly basis. This slide is a picture that we can have -- on 28th of July and shows monthly capacity as a proportion of 2019 through to the end of the year and then annually for 2021 and 2022.",
         "We have reduced the capacity by 95% in the second quarter. We currently plan 75% reduction for the third quarter. It's true that we are going to increase the capacity from minus 85% in July to minus 62% by September, but it's still very slow. And we estimate that the fourth quarter, we will be around minus 46%.",
         "So the total passenger capacity for 2020 is expected to be minus 59%, which is worse than what we expected last May that was around 50%. And as I said before, this is mainly due to the U.K. 14-day quarantine period that we have right now and the slow return on U.S. and other longhaul routes.",
         "We are considering a slow return to service. In that way, we can maximize the load factors and boost the cash for the group. And what we are trying to ensure is that each flight that we do is cash positive. We have and -- the aim to be operating cash flow positive by the end of 2020, but for sure this depends on a lot of factors relating to COVID and also the customer that favors bookings.",
         "If we talk about the sizing of the business for the future. All the airlines in the group are planning for significant downsizing over the next two years and starting now and continuing next winter. In this chart, you can see some of the changes that they are planning to make in terms of the networks, the fleet and the people. It is difficult to have specific capacity plans beyond 2020, but we know that air travel demand will be significantly lower over the next two years than it was in 2019.",
         "We will try to protect as many jobs as possible, but in the short-term we will have to make significant cuts once the various governments' furloughs and wage support schemes come to an end.",
         "Aer Lingus, for example, has already returned six wet leases -- wet-leased aircraft to lessors and expect to have at least nine aircraft on the ground at the end of 2020. They are currently working also on a reduction in the head count of 250 people, and they will be also working in pilot salary reduction and outsourcing the catering operations.",
         "British Airways proposal are very well known in the U.K. It has made an agreement with BALPA with the pilots union that is currently being in a ballot. It plans to reduce annual employee costs by around 24% by 2022 and that could involve over 9,000 redundancies. BA has already decided to exit its Boeing 747 fleet with early retirement of the remaining 30 aircraft, as well around eight Airbus 318s and six Boeing 777s for up to two years until longhaul demand returns.",
         "Iberia is retiring their 340-600s and also they are grounding 19 other aircraft as of the end of this year. We are expecting in Iberia to benefit from the current ERTE government scheme that it will end in September, but there is a possible extension of some support until the end of 2020. Once ERTE is finalized, Iberia we will have to decide with what labor actions are we going to follow.",
         "LEVEL as you know, we only maintain the operation in Barcelona and we have closed operations in Vienna, Amsterdam. And also Paris is subject to consultation. So the idea is to maintain Barcelona operation, and to see the development of the demand there.",
         "Vueling is in a similar situation to Iberia in terms of the ERTE program. They plan to keep 48 320 aircraft grounded until the end of 2020 with most of them returning to operation in 2021. All these restructuring plans are still in the current -- in the consultation stage with the labor unions in the different operators.",
         "For sure, we will keep you updated with the progress of the restructuring in the future quarterly results meetings and possible -- and possibly, sorry at a future Capital Markets Day. We don't expect to have a Capital Markets Day this November, but it will be more likely in early 2021.",
         "And finally, about the Air Europa operation. We assure that this acquisition has a strategic and financial value for the group. So, despite the challenging operating environment we remain committed to take advantage of consolidation opportunities.",
         "And we are negotiating to find a way to do this transaction in this difficult environment but for sure in different conditions than the ones were agreed last November.",
         "And with that I hand over to Willie."
      ],
      "Steve Gunning": [
         "Thanks, Willie. Good morning, everyone. I'll now take you through the half one results and also our response to COVID-19. We thought it would be useful to set the context for the results, so to do that we borrowed two slides from IATA. The slide on \u2013 the graph on the left shows passenger demand since the year 2000.",
         "And as you can see as \u2013 lots of people like to use the word \"unprecedented\" but this truly is an unprecedented event. You will have to squint to see the global financial crisis or SARS or many of the other crises that we've faced since 2000 but you won't need to do any squinting to see the COVID-19 event, so these really are unprecedented times.",
         "The graph on the right shows that airlines registered in Europe have also been very heavily impacted. Only Asia Pacific has had a greater impact. And I think for Europe this is partly due to the modest level of domestic flying and the higher level of flying across international boundaries. And hence government restrictions and travel advisories can have a disproportionate effect. So that's the context.",
         "Let's turn to the numbers. In quarter two you'll see that passenger revenue was down 96.7%. It's at \u20ac198 million. That's consistent with the ASK reduction of about 95%. You'll see that cargo revenue has actually been strong in the quarter and actually recorded a record level of revenue, despite volumes being down about 37.5%. And so overall, revenue was down 89%.",
         "If we look at the costs, despite all of the hard work that we've done on costs and continue to do on costs, not just temporary but restructuring the cost base at the moment our costs reduced about 63.5%. So all in all for Q2, we generated a pre-exceptional operating loss of \u20ac1365 million. And if we add that to the minus \u20ac535 million in Q1, we get a half year of \u2013 pre-exceptional operating loss of \u20ac1.9 billion. And so that's pre-exceptional.",
         "So let's turn and talk about the exceptional charges. Three items in the exceptional charges for the first half, you'll recall I believe that at the Q1 results I took you through in quite a lot of detail the nature of the fuel over-hedging loss, which at the time was at \u20ac1325 million. And we explained that actually that over-hedging loss could actually increase, when we mark to market our excess hedge book at the end of April, using the latest forward curve. At that point it looked like the hedge loss could go up as high as \u20ac1.5 billion.",
         "There have been three factors that have moved that number during the course of quarter two. The actual commodity price has increased, which is actually helpful in this scenario. The ramp-up of our capacity has been slower, which means we've had to de-designate more hedges. And the FX rates have been somewhat favorable. So overall, that \u20ac1325 million at the end of Q1 has come down to \u20ac1269 million for the half year.",
         "We also do hedge some of our overseas currencies for revenue purposes and we are over-hedged on some of those and so we've had to take an over-hedge loss of \u20ac38 million in the half as well. And so overall our over-hedging losses \u2013 or over-hedging charge in half one is \u20ac1307 million.",
         "In Q2, as we trialed in the Q1 results, we did decide to impair the 32 747-400 aircraft that we have. That's the entire fleet remaining fleet. We also impaired the entire remaining fleet of the A340-600s as well and a number of other aircraft, so all in all, impairing those aircraft and the related inventory has led to an impairment charge of \u20ac808 million.",
         "And finally in terms of exceptional charges in the first half, as you know we received a notice of intent to fine from the Information Commissioner's Office in July 2019 for the sum of GBP183 million. We've now booked a provision for what we expect the outcome to be which is a provision of GBP20 million. ",
         "So moving on from the exceptional charges, let's turn to debt and liquidity. As you'll see since March our debt has increased by \u20ac2 billion up to \u20ac16.5 billion. Some of the key items in there are clearly we have received loans in Spain for both Vueling and Iberia that are backed by the Spanish government under the ICO program. That was about \u20ac1 billion of loans. As you know, we also tapped the commercial paper program in the U.K. the CCFF for \u20ac0.3 billion as well. And we have taken in aircraft deliveries which have also added to the debt. So overall gross debt has increased \u20ac2 billion. ",
         "Cash has reduced \u20ac0.9 billion and hence net debt has gone up \u20ac2.9 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA is 4.2 times. If I look at cash. The cash position is \u20ac6 billion at the end of June which represents 24% of 2019 revenues. We came into the year at 26% so I think we've done a very good job maintaining the cash position. And similarly liquidity is at \u20ac8.1 billion as Willie mentioned earlier which represents 32% of 2019 revenues. We came into 2020 at 34% so we continued to maintain a strong liquidity position despite the challenges of Q2. ",
         "Liquidity is a nice lead-in to the response to COVID-19 because a lot of our focus has been how to optimize liquidity during the course of the crisis. The way we've looked at this exercise is to break it into a number of work streams and we've just given you an overview of those work streams on this slide. ",
         "Clearly operating cost reductions are key reducing the level of the fixed cost restructuring the business and also reducing capacity to the optimal level. Clearly reducing CapEx to the minimum is key. Reducing fleet deliveries and fleet delivery payments has been a big exercise. I'll take you through more of that in a moment. ",
         "Working capital management increasing the focus on this to make sure we maintain the cash position and also all the other activities to bolster liquidity mainly treasury activities but other activities on top of that. I'll now take you through a slide on each of those work streams to give you a bit more of a flavor of what we've been doing. ",
         "If we turn to operating cost cash burn. At Q1, we said for April and May the regular flying program would have had an operating cost cash burn of \u20ac440 million and we'd -- we're confident we've reduced that to \u20ac200 million for April and May. Actually for quarter two, we've reduced that down to \u20ac193 million so we overachieved on what we were attempting to do but we did say we were not content with \u20ac200 million. ",
         "We're showing \u20ac205 million here because one of the key characteristics of Q2 has been a very strong cargo demand. We've run 1,800 nearly 1,900 additional rotations that are cargo-driven and we hadn't factored in the operating costs related to those flights when we came up with our estimates for April and May. ",
         "I must add just for clarity these numbers do not net off the cargo revenue. These are purely cost numbers. The revenue sits outside of these numbers. So we think it was very worthwhile incurring those additional operating costs to generate that additional cargo revenue. ",
         "If we look to the months of July and August. Once again, we would have expected to have a regular flying program cost of about \u20ac455 million. We think we will post our management actions have a cash burn of about \u20ac205 million per week during those two months. And it's worth highlighting the fact that all of these numbers are per week rather than per month. ",
         "So \u20ac205 million pretty much the same as Q2, but do bear-in-mind our planning scenario at the moment is to fly 10 points more capacity in these months than we did in Q2. So we think that's an improvement in performance. Once again these are not static pictures. We continue to work on how to minimize the operating cost cash burn. ",
         "Move to the next slide, let's talk about capital expenditure. And what we presented at Capital Markets Day in November 2019 was for the three years 2020, 2021 and 2022 a CapEx bill at a gross level of \u20ac14.2 billion. Due to our discussions negotiations and contracting with the OEMs and also looking internally at the non-fleet CapEx, we've now reduced that to \u20ac7 billion across the three years. So we've gone from an average of \u20ac4.8 million per annum to about \u20ac2.3 million per annum. We think that's a significant improvement. ",
         "What's changed since we spoke at the end of Q1 is those positions are now contracted with the OEMs rather than under discussion so that's good progress. The other thing I'm pleased to say is we indicated at the quarter one results that we had about half of the fleet CapEx covered by committed financing at that time and we were still working at committing and covering the fleet CapEx costs of 2020 fully. And I'm pleased to say we've now done that so there will not be a cash drain on the business in 2020 due to the aircraft deliveries. So I think that's good progress there. Once again all of this continues to move but I think that's good progress. ",
         "If we look at the next slide. It shows you the fleet delivery program. This is consistent with what we said at Q1 albeit, it's now contracted. Secondly, we've now firmed up the impairments that I touched on earlier. And thirdly, we continue to have the fleet flexibility related to the leases expiring both this year and in the next two years and it's still our intention to go ahead and let 20 of the leases expire and not be renewed. So that's CapEx. ",
         "Let's turn to working capital management. Two things to focus on I don't know if you recall, but when we went through the full year results in the end of February I did mention then I was a little disappointed with our level of receivables at the end of December. I thought they were too high. I think the team has done a very good job over the last six months to drive the receivables down to the lowest level possible and to get the cash in. And we've seen really good progress there and that particularly helps our liquidity in Q1. ",
         "The other area, we've clearly been thinking and putting a lot of focus on has been the deferred revenue including the sales in advance of carriage. And as you can see that's come down only \u20ac862 million. So the level of working capital unwind there has been minimized quite effectively. We haven't put the split here between what relates to the loyalty program and what relates to sales in advance of carriage, but what I would say is the loyalty program has been relatively stable. And most of that reduction - most of that working capital unwind has been in relation to sales in advance of carriage.",
         "But given the amount of drop in revenue, given the -- and therefore the reduced bookings and also given the level of refunds for that to have only unwound by \u20ac862 million I think is a good outcome.",
         "If we then turn to liquidity. Again as I said the liquidity at the end of June is \u20ac8.1 billion \u20ac2.1 billion of facilities and \u20ac6 billion of cash. As I say we've entered into the CCFF and the ICO loans during the course of Q2. We also entered into some bridge facilities in order to finance aircraft as well.",
         "After June so subsequent to the \u20ac8.1 billion, we've had two other significant developments which will improve our liquidity further. One of them is signing the deals with American Express. And so we will be receiving payments of \u00a3750 million in due course. And also we had 5 aircraft that we'd received by the 30th of June which we needed to complete the financing on and we've successfully completed those in July. In fact we've actually received the cash in at the end of July and that's for $400 million.",
         "We've had to be patient with the sale and leaseback market because at certain points the market was very dysfunctional. And some of the rates being offered by lessors were particularly unattractive, so we've had to be patient and wait for the right moment to go back into the market to finance these aircraft. And I'm very comfortable with the rates we've achieved on those aircraft. So that takes you through what the half one results at a high level and also takes you through some of the actions we've been taking to optimize liquidity during half 1.",
         "I'll now hand you over to Luis Gallego to talk about positioning IAG for the future.",
         "Thanks Willie. Yes, in terms of the proposed capital increase as Willie has already covered we're looking to increase up to \u20ac2.75 billion our equity position. There's a general meeting scheduled now where we will seek shareholder approval on the 8th of September.",
         "I'm pleased to say in regards to the rights issue that Qatar, our largest shareholder with 25.1% has irrevocably committed to support the capital increase. And for the remaining 74.9%, we have fully underwritten the capital raise on a standby basis. We think that's a worthwhile exercise to undertake given the time scale is from the 31st of July to the general meeting.",
         "Markets are volatile at the moment and this gives us a commitment to funding the full amount irrespective of share price movements which is helpful. I'm pleased to say the Directors have committed to take up in full or in part their entitlements under the capital increase. And it's our current expectation that we will then launch soon after the general meeting which would be on the 10th of September.",
         "If we turn to the next slide. As I think Willie has touched on already the purpose of this raise is to strengthen the balance sheet by reducing leverage and also to enhancing liquidity and this would give us more resilience to withstand a prolonged downturn in the industry and it would give us confidence going through that process.",
         "As Willie alluded to, it's been sized on a downside case and I'll take you through that a bit more in a moment. The raise also provides us strategic flexibility and the ability to further develop the group.",
         "And it is worth noting as we've put on this slide that this money is being raised at the IAG level and we will continue to exercise capital discipline as we look to use those funds. We will only use it where we think there is valid returns on that money.",
         "If we turn a bit more to the sizing of the exercise. The principles we've employed in coming up with the sizing is to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to withstand a prolonged downturn in the air travel industry and how we arrived at that well as Willie alluded to earlier, we have run with the principle of having 20% of revenue as a cash holding at any point in time.",
         "And so what we came what we did was we produced a commercial downside case which looked out for two years. That commercial downside case was based on numerous different assumptions. It assumes that ASKs will be down 66% in 2020. They will be down 35% in 2021. Those are both versus 2019 figures.",
         "We've made assumptions as to how markets will ramp up in a pessimistic scenario both on a regional basis. So, we've looked at North America. We've looked at South America on separate bases and we've looked at the other regions too.",
         "We've considered what we think the fleet financing environment will be like and the other mitigating cost actions. And so all of those factors and assumptions go into a commercial downside case. We've then projected what we think the cash could look like in that severe scenario. We found a trough point.",
         "And then we've solved from that trough point back to 20% of the next 12 months revenues as a cash holding and that's how we've sized it. We think that then gives us the resilience and the liquidity to withstand a prolonged downturn.",
         "We also think this is the right time to do this in terms of where markets are and the degree of uncertainty so the right time and the right sizing. The other factors in our view were it also helps re-equitize the balance sheet and offsets pretty much all of the debt that we've incurred since the advent of COVID-19. So, that's some of the principles and some of the working that we've done in order to size and think through the timing of the capital raise.",
         "And with that I will hand you back to Willie for final conclusions."
      ],
      "Willie Walsh": [
         "Thank you, Antonio and good morning everybody. And allow me to take this opportunity to thank Antonio for the job he has done as Chairman of IAG and in supporting me in my role as the Chief Executive since we created IAG. I very much appreciate his support and his guidance and thank him for everything he has done and congratulate him on an excellent career.",
         "It's clear that we went into this crisis in a strong position, both strategically and financially. However, the COVID-19 events have caused substantial damage and losses for the global industry and for us within the industry with today our first half pre-exceptional operating loss that we reported of \u20ac1.9 billion. We acted quickly to offset the negative impacts of the downturn. We've taken all responsible actions to bolster our liquidity and to protect the long-term future of the business.",
         "Like most in the industry now and I think consistent with the latest forecasts, we believe it will take probably until 2023 or 2024 or at least 2023 before we see passenger demand recover to 2019 levels. We have a clear path for returning to service. We're clear in terms of what we need to do to rightsize the business and to restructure the airlines to do what's right as that demand gradually return.",
         "And based on our current capacity planning scenario, we would reach breakeven in terms of net cash flows from operating activities during the fourth quarter of this year. And as the Chairman has said, in addition to all of the actions we've taken to date, we are proposing a capital increase of up to \u20ac2.75 billion which will further strengthen our financial and strategic position.",
         "So if we look at this proposed increase, we believe it will improve our resilience. It's fully supported by our largest shareholder Qatar Airways and it will allow us to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce leverage. It clearly enhances our liquidity and helps us to withstand a prolonged extended downturn in air travel. And we've sized this increase on a commercial downside case looking at a stretched recovery that Steve will take you through later on. It will give us additional flexibility, provide us the opportunity to take advantages of any opportunities that present themselves as the demand recovers and enable us to continue to invest to improve the performance of the business and exploit any new innovation.",
         "Important to remind you and I think this is where we have an excellent track record that we will selectively distribute capital to the operating companies based on our clearly defined capital allocation disciplines. And this will enable us to focus on long-term value drivers for the airline, as we come through this crisis. So this is all designed to help us to capitalize on our strengths and to enable us not just to survive this immediate downturn, but more importantly to ensure that we have a business that's fit for purpose as we come out of this crisis. We have a successful and proven business model.",
         "You've seen this chart many times before. We believe, we have a portfolio of world-class brands and operations. We have leadership positions in key markets. And we have a common platform, an integrated platform that we continue to build up that delivers significant synergies to the operating companies. Our airlines give an unrivaled customer proposition. They have a clear track record of efficiency and innovation and we look at pursuing sustainable value-accretive growth and all of it underpinned by our continuing commitment to environmental sustainability.",
         "And if you look at our track record in terms of consolidation since IAG was formed in 2001, the excellent acquisition of BMI to strengthen our position at Heathrow, Vueling in 2013, Aer Lingus in 2015, the slot acquisition from Monarch in 2017; and then more importantly, where we explored an option to acquire Norwegian and having investigated it walked away when we were clear that we could not generate the value that shareholders would expect. So we are not driven to consolidate. We will only consolidate where we believe that that consolidation will make sense for our shareholders. And that is the case with Air Europe where the strategic argument remained strong and the synergies remained very encouraging.",
         "We've also helped in consolidation through the creation of joint businesses. And while our industry is prevented from genuine cross-border consolidation, we have been able to pursue a number of attractive joint businesses, starting with the exploitation of the transatlantic joint business, which we signed in October 2010; the creation of the Siberian joint business with JAL in 2012; Finnair's addition in 2013 to both the transatlantic and then in 2014 to the Siberian one; a Qatar joint business in 2016; and most recently a joint business with China Southern in China.",
         "And all of this, don't forget, helped to deliver synergies that went well in excess of the targeted synergies for the business achieving \u20ac860 million of annual synergies by 2015 through the BA-Iberia merger.",
         "We have a track record of delivering strong and improving profitability with targeted margins of between 12% and 15% and those targets remain relevant for the business going forward. And I know Luis will have an opportunity to comment on that later on.",
         "ROIC target, our initial target of 12% changed in 2016 to 15%. And again, we believe that these are relevant to the medium-term targets for the business. So we have a strong track record. Delivering on those targets helped to improve our financial position as we went into this crisis with our adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA at very respectable levels as you can see from the chart on the left-hand side.",
         "And very important, as we've stressed throughout this crisis, our cash position was absolutely critical. So entering into the crisis above our cash targets, which is a policy of holding 20% of \u2013 traditionally we look at the trailing 12 months revenue. So in 2019, in December 2019, we had 26% of trailing 12 months revenue in cash terms with additional facilities bringing total liquidity at 34%.",
         "So we believe this is an important buffer. It's clearly stood the test of time and enabled us to take the actions that have been required in the short term and most importantly to continue to put us in a position where our liquidity remains healthy today. And we've been pleased to fulfill the ambition that we expressed when we created IAG to reward our shareholders. And we believe that this is a fundamental principle and a requirement of any business to ensure that shareholders get rewarded for the money, the capital that they invest in the business. And we have a strong track record.",
         "And I know that the Board and management remain absolutely committed to reintroducing dividend payments at the right time for the business going forward. And we will not walk away from our commitments on environmental performance. We've led the industry in tackling climate change. Our actions through this crisis reinforce that some of the painful measures that we've had to take will help us to achieve these carbon efficiency targets. And we believe it's absolutely critical that we in the industry and the industry collectively demonstrate our commitment to addressing the environmental impact of aviation and to do everything we can.",
         "So our targets are ambitious, getting to net zero by 2050, fully aligned with government's ambition and fully committed to achieving those targets despite the crisis that we're going through at the moment.",
         "I'll now hand over to Steve to take you through the formal results presentation and will talk to you later on.",
         "Thank you, Luis. I'm going to let Steve take you through the proposed capital raise and then I will come back and wrap it up before we take your questions. Steve?",
         "Thanks Steve. So, just to remind you we came into this in a strong position. Clearly, the crisis has been damaging to the industry and to IAG as part of the industry with the results that we're announcing today. We acted fast. We took all responsible actions to address and mitigate the negative impacts. We've bolstered liquidity and we're clearly very focused on protecting the long-term future of the business.",
         "We don't expect demand at a passenger level to recover for a number of years and hence we're resizing and restructuring the airlines within the group to ensure that we have the right structures and size in place as that demand gradually returns.",
         "And as we've mentioned on a couple of occasions now through this presentation based on our current capacity planning scenario we would reach breakeven in terms of net cash flows from operating activities during the fourth quarter of this year.",
         "And we believe it's appropriate now that in addition to all of the actions we have taken to date we'll propose this capital increase of up to \u20ac2.75 billion to our shareholders to further strengthen our financial and strategic position.",
         "So, on that, I'm going to hand back to the operator who will now manage your question session and we'll try and get through as many of your questions as possible. Thank you."

Luis, I apologize if I missed this in your comments, but first question is I was wondering what you expect from a capacity standpoint across the various airlines in the second half and more importantly in the resizing that you outlined on slide 31 what the different airlines will be resized to if it's similar or if you expect something different based on maybe business and international taking longer to recover? And then maybe Steve, just the American Express extension. Wondering how much of that was related to kind of the repurchase of miles and when we might start to see dilution of that and the length of the extension? Thank you."

So we're not going to give a breakdown by individual airline, but I think if we look as we go through this year as Luis said in his presentation 74% down in Q3 versus 2019 and 46% down in Q4. But what is important is as you alluded in your question the businesses are very different. So if I look at Vueling about one-third of their capacity is in domestic markets, two-thirds intra-European and North Africa. And then you turn to British Airways where less than 2% of capacity is in domestic a very small U.K. domestic market. It's about 18% intra-Europe which leaves about 80% in long-haul international. ",
            "And as Luis set out in his presentation, our expectation supported by what it is we're seeing in the market is that you see recovery in domestic markets first followed by recovery in short-haul international in our case intra-European, and then followed by long-haul international flying. So the capacity for each of the airlines will reflect the nature of their particular network structure which is very different for all of the airlines. And as Steve mentioned, the view is that the recovery in Latin America will lag North America and North America lags the rest of the network. So you will expect as a result of that to see different levels of capacity growth in the different airlines. Steve, on Amex please?"

How does that change your kind of percentage of leased aircraft over the next two to three years? And how are you thinking about the balance which you previously targeted about roughly half and half? So kind of the leased/owned question kind of into the next couple of years. And lastly, could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing and expecting in terms of business demand? Also thinking about next year, it kind of seems from your guidance that you're expecting business travel to recover almost to previous levels by '22, '23. And are there any medium-term actions you're considering like reconfigurations in the fleet? Thanks. "

So in terms of the cash operating costs as Luis pointed out we're availing of income support schemes where they exist in Ireland, U.K. and Spain. But given that those schemes are temporary, we are putting restructuring measures in place. So Luis took you through some of the details of that. So in British Airways for example, we are expecting I think about 1400 people to leave the business by today under a voluntary redundancy scheme. So we have voluntary redundancy schemes in place. We have restructuring in place. So as we unwind these income support schemes, they will be replaced by restructuring and employment costs in the airline. Steve on the aircraft leases?"

The EETC market amongst others hasn't effectively properly opened yet. So it's difficult to be too categoric as to how we're going to finance the aircraft deliveries in 2021, 2022 because we need to see how the markets open. If the markets are fully open then we will continue to use the principles that we've outlined in previous Capital Markets Day. We'll look at the nature of the aircraft we're purchasing. Is it niche? Is it core? How long we think we're going to hold these aircraft and then determine what's the right way to finance the aircraft. So assuming the markets are open, we won't divert from the principles we've previously adopted, but at the moment I think we still need to see the markets properly open. And I don't think the EETC market is quite there yet."

So you've heard what we said earlier: domestic markets recover first; then short haul in effect intra-European; then long-haul international. And then in terms of customer segments, we believe it's leisure recovering ahead of business. And like we saw in 2009 with the global financial crisis, we think there is structural change in the business. And it's important always to separate business travel from premium travel because not all customers that travel in the premium cabins are traveling on business. But that we would see business travel lag in terms of recovery. So it will be leisure markets recovering ahead of business markets and that's clearly evidenced.",
            "Now if that leads to structural change, which we believe it will, you will see that then reflected in how we configure our aircraft, but we're not changing any of the configuration of the aircraft. But it was a factor in the decision to retire the 747s in British Airways, which as you know, are in a high-premium configuration. So, yeah, we are expecting a change in the structure of the business market going forward. Luis, do you want to give a view?"

            "Yes. I mean what you said, I think what we see is that when the markets are open, we\u2019ve seen a recovery of the demand very fast, to be honest. We have seen that in Spain, in Balearic Islands and in Canary Islands markets. Now, as I said before, we have a delay because of the issue of the quarantine, but it looks like the leisure market recovers fast when there are no restrictions.",
            "It's true that we need to see in the future what's going to be the behavior of the business travelers, but we expect also a recovery as in other previous crises. I'm talking about the aircraft in our case, for example, in Iberia.",

The good thing of this group is that as we are in a solid position, we can think in the medium-term and in the future. And we consider that this is an operation for the future of the group, for the future of Iberia, for the future of Madrid hub.

            "Now I know, Ben is a very different leader, but our view is that the industry has structurally changed. I gave some figures in relation to BA, just to put it into context in some of the media interviews I did. In Q4 2001, post the tragic events of 9/11, BA lost \u00a3187 million in the quarter.",
            "In first quarter of 2009, in the depth of the global financial crisis, BA lost \u00a3309 million. In the second quarter of this year, in the depth of this crisis, BA's operating loss was \u00a3711 million. And nobody questions the fact that 2001 and 2009 led to permanent structural change and required structural response. Anybody who believes that this is just a temporary crisis, and can be resolved through temporary measures, is misguided.",
            "So, we are focused on our liquidity, but more importantly, we're focused on restructuring the business to ensure that we're in the right shape for the future. I worry for some of the others in the industry, who are looking at strong liquidity and are not responding to the structural change that will be necessary. And I think it will be interesting to see the rate at which some of those companies burn through their cash as we go through the rest of this year and through I'm thinking of 2021 and 2022. So, I'll watch with interest from a distance, but that's my view Stephen for what it's worth."

He's an aviation professional. He's an excellent, excellent guy. We've worked with him for a number of years. These are quality nominations to the Board of IAG and represent a \u2013 I think an excellent addition in terms of the skills and backgrounds of the two people.

It continues to be a great asset. And we have obviously explored all thoughts when we've been looking at liquidity as to how best to leverage that asset. Our view is the Amex deal is the right way to do this. I don't think at this stage securing borrowings off of our holding in Avios would be a sensible way forward. We think it's a key strategic asset for us, and I think the Amex deal is a smart way to increase liquidity without affecting our position with regards to it.",
            "In terms of supplier deals to your third question, we've looked through all of our critical suppliers to ensure one that nothing falls over and we don't have an issue as we restart. In terms of can we go further with some of the deals with the suppliers absolutely and you won't be surprised to know that we have detailed procurement plans for every category of spending that we have. I think one of the areas that, we will look to focus on probably more than we have done in the past will be to increase the variability of the costs in the contracts. So one of the things that, we'll be focusing on over the next year or two is increasing the level of variability of unit costs, because if you work on the basis of will we get any second spikes will there be more volatility and capacity then I think that variability becomes more important.

I think the media talked about you paying about 50% of the original \u20ac1 billion. I'm just wondering two things on that: one whether you should really be paying anything for it; and secondly, if you're more likely to get full approval given the COVID pandemic. Clearly, when it was first announced I think there was talk of a lot of remedies.",

Clearly, Unite have made some relatively absurd comments about what you should and shouldn't be doing.

What we are sure is that, this deal will provide value to this group.

            "Okay. In relation to LEVEL, we intend to continue to operate at Barcelona. So it is with more than two aircraft. I think, the LEVEL brand is very strong in Barcelona has worked very well for us. I \u2013 but I think what we've done in relation to LEVEL demonstrates as, you know, we're clearly focused on the businesses achieving the targets that we've set. And where they don't achieve these then we're not going to put good money after that. And I think that demonstrates yet again the capital discipline that we have. So the management at LEVEL Europe as it was called Anisec based in Austria we're clear that they couldn't see a viable path to recovery and to achieve the targets that we have for the business.",
            "And therefore, their recommendation was that the business could not be rescued. As Luis mentioned in France, we're in the process of consultation in relation to LEVEL Paris. But the Barcelona business has been viable and has delivered good returns and has a clear and viable path to achieve the targets that we've set for the business.",
            "And then restructuring in BA, I'm always optimistic. There's no reason why we can't reach agreement. I think the trade union Unite entered into this crisis with the view that this was just a temporary downturn that they believed that we could get through this by making some short-term measures, which everybody is prepared to do. But I think they've been completely out of touch with the reality of the situation given the scale of the challenge we face. And that's why I think it is helpful to go back and remember what happened in 2001 and everybody talks about it. But to just put it into context the scale of the challenge then and to remind people what happened in 2009 and put that into context. Because that -- in my 41 years in this industry, 2001 was a very deep and challenging crisis for the industry. 2009 was even worse.",
            "And I said that at the time, if you go back and read what I said about the global financial crisis, I said it was worse than 2001. This is worse by any measure and by many times anything we've seen previously and therefore, it requires serious structural action. And we're determined at IAG. But more importantly, the management team in all -- teams in all of the operating companies are determined. So they know what needs to be done. They're determined to do it. And I have full confidence that they will achieve all of the objectives that they have set for themselves and we share those objectives. We believe they're doing the right thing and we have confidence that they will deliver."

Or how much of a reawakening of the premium -- sorry the corporate would you need to make that happen? Can I ask a question, another question on Air Europa please? Willie, I think it was you that said that the best form of consolidation is it's free as other airlines fail. Perhaps, I'm wrong. Maybe it was one of your compatriots who I talk less to. But what I want to know is why does that logic, which I think is powerful, why does that not apply in the case of Air Europa? And then finally, on the North Atlantic, what comments can you offer around the partnership between American and JetBlue? And obviously, Willie, we've said goodbye many times before, but goodbye.

Andrew great questions, but just to remind you what we said is that in terms of net cash flows from operating activities and it is based on our current capacity scenario. So that's the scenario that Luis identified which is 74% -- minus 74% in Q3, minus 46% in Q4. So it does assume that we will see some operations on the transatlantic, but it clearly doesn't envisage a full return to transatlantic capacity. But it is based on our current planning scenarios.",
            "In relation to Air Europa, yes, I've said that many times. The best form of consolidation is failure and we believe in this. However, we firmly believe Air Europa will not fail and that has been a fundamental factor in our decision. So if we believed Air Europa would fail and disappear, then clearly that is something -- with all due respect to them nobody wants to see that happen. But if that were to happen, that would be our preferred environment. But that is not going to happen and we're absolutely clear that that is the case. And therefore, I go back to what we said that the strategic rationale remains strong and that's why we are in discussions with Air Europa. And I think Luis has answered all of the related comments in relation to that potential acquisition.",
            "And finally, I am delighted that American are looking at a relationship with JetBlue, so JetBlue on the East Coast and Alaska on the West Coast. I think that's really, really positive. It's good for American and it's good for us. We've got good relationships with Alaska. And we've got good relationships with JetBlue, particularly with Aer Lingus and JetBlue a long-standing cooperation. We're pleased to see it. We encouraged American to do it and we're delighted that it's actually happening. So I think that's a very positive development."

What level of working capital were you expecting? So we had around \u20ac400 million positive for the first half. What are you expecting for the second half? My second question is what kind of load factors are you expecting to see in the second half of the year? And third question, I guess. Your net debt has increased \u20ac3 billion in the first half of the year. If we take into account the Amex deal and the rights issue, is it fair to say that by year-end you should be with net debt roughly \u20ac1 billion below the level that you are now in -- or that you were at as of June?"

            "Okay. Thank you. In terms of -- I'll let Chris -- or sorry, I'll let Steve address the second question and the third question. In terms of load factors, we're operating at significantly lower load factors at the moment and we think it will take a bit of time to get back to normal levels of load factors. What we are looking at in all of the flying that we're doing is the cash breakeven load factor which is clearly very different to the way we would have approached things in the past. And we're measuring this down to the euro. It's not down to the hundreds or thousands of euros. We're looking at this down to the euro. We did the very same with cargo. In fact, one of the really positive things the cargo team did was be able to assess the cash breakeven point for all of the additional cargo activities. And as Steve mentioned we did almost 1900 additional cargo flights in the quarter just under 1900. All of those were cash positive.",
            "And in addition to those flights, we also operated other flights that carried passengers that would not have been cash positive, if it weren't for the cargo. So we're very focused on what sort of load factors we need to get to be cash positive. That is very different to what you would traditionally expect from us, but we're very disciplined around the capacity that we're adding. But you should not expect us to get back to normal levels of load factors for some time.",
            "The one thing I would say is, going back to comments I made earlier, we are encouraged by booking profiles that we see particularly in the U.K. We were somewhat concerned after the government reintroduced the quarantine for people traveling from Spain that that would discourage people flying to other leisure destinations. That does not appear to be the case.",
            "So in some of the flights that we're operating to places like Greece, we're now forecasting load factors over 100%, because of the short-term demand that we're seeing. So we're adding capacity in those markets, because we see good demand, but don't be too focused. In fact, I've always said, load factors only give you part of the story.",
            "It's more important for us to look at all parts of it, so the yields and the load factor and looking at the unit revenue, but particularly, at this stage, understanding at what point do we get to cash breakeven in terms of load factors on the -- both the assumed yield scenarios and the visible and booked yields that we have in the business. Steve, do you want to talk about -- "

But my sort of initial thoughts on them would be, given the fact we can't give you full year guidance at the moment, it would be sort of somewhat irresponsible for me to try and call net debt and working capital. My expectation would be working capital will be somewhat positive, but I don't think it would be right for me to try and give a number on that, if I can't give proper guidance overall.",

Given now that you've cut down your network quite significantly, should we also expect, particularly with British Airways which was restricted in Heathrow, that we will see a kind of different British Airways in the future so -- and will be a more global one and a little bit less focused on the North Atlantic?

We do and have always looked at the capital base and the return to ensure that we are using capital in the most efficient way possible and I think we've been successful doing that.",

And as I said earlier premium demand will lag leisure demand. And more importantly, as these aircraft get older as you know they incur significant additional maintenance costs, which we look at from a capital basis as well.",
            "So, we've looked at all of the factors here and we decided that we could not make a case to return the 747s to service in the near-term and therefore, given that we would face extended costs associated with grounding them and then maintenance costs to bring them back into service, and then costs associated with taking them out of service it made absolute sense to take them out of service now.",
            "But you're right, we factored in everything. It wasn't driven by one issue. It was driven by a number of factors. We did the very same on the A340s. So, maybe Luis you want to comment before we let Steve answer the other questions."

            "And what we expect about the future with the fuel price that we consider we are going to have when the world is going to come back to a normal world in some way, we consider that the 350 is the right aircraft in the future. It's true that is -- an aircraft is expensive and we need to pay for the parts, but we are going to save fuel costs and maintenance costs.

            "Luis if I take over on the other questions. In terms of did we consider a convertible, we considered all options when we were looking at what was the right way to raise further liquidity and also give ourselves further strength particularly to withstand a prolonged downturn.",
            "So, we looked at convertibles amongst other things. We wanted to do something that gave us sufficient levels of improvement to liquidity and to our balance sheet strength and issuing a convertible would have done neither of those things. It wouldn't have been sufficient. The amount you could have raised would have been considerably lower and quite a lot lower than what you could do through an equity raise and it wouldn't have helped with the balance sheet leverage either.",
            "So, for a number of factors, we felt that the equity raise is the right way and it's the right size. I don't think a convertible would have met that. And what we didn't want to do is to sort of piecemeal something this week something next week, et cetera, et cetera. I think everybody would benefit from some degree of certainty.",
            "In terms of the aircraft, it's an interesting question canceled versus deferred. Clearly, when you're going through that exercise, you start from a position; you have a legal contract to take these aircraft. So, it is a negotiation is the context of this backdrop.",
            "But I would refer you back to the presentation we made at Capital Markets Day in November where we outlined our fleet plans for the -- about the next 10 years. And if you look at those fleet plans, beyond about 2022, the number of aircraft orders that we had was pretty modest to be honest and much less than many other airlines. So, we actually do want to get these new-generation aircraft into our business. I think Luis spoke earlier about the environmental benefits and the operating cost benefits.",
            "So, for us, it was not a case of we no longer want these aircraft. It was a case of when do we want the aircraft and hence the deferral became more appropriate for us than just pure cancellations.",
            "And as I say we do have flexibility with our existing fleet leases et cetera to enable us to smooth that transition. So, canceled versus deferred I think due to the size of the order book beyond 2022 I think the key thing for us was we still want the aircraft. It's just about when do we want them and that's why we took that approach."

I'm wondering where those cuts are being seen, any particular projects? What projects are essential to continue to underpin the functionality of the business? So a bit more detail on that side will be interesting.",

I'm wondering if you can just give us an idea of what the size of your short-haul and long-haul fleets will look like at the end of 2020 and 2021 given the revised contracts on deliveries.",
            "Probably one for Willie, Virgin Atlantic, I'm kind of interested to know what you think in terms of their competitive position vis-\u00e0-vis BA in the light of their efforts to survive how you see that shaping out on the North Atlantic in particular.",
            "And I suppose like most people, Willie, we're sad to leave you -- see you leave IAG. But as Alex said difficult to see you retiring. Do you want to give us a hint to where you may reappear other than at Mary Mac's pub?"

            "On the non-fleet CapEx, it's a good question. In terms of where our priorities, I see a sort of -- I see the IT portfolio spend in sort of three, maybe four simplistic buckets. One I've touched on cybersecurity, so I won't go there again. Another area that we are keen to progress is getting off legacy systems and legacy infrastructure. So we need to continue to move along that path.",
            "And the third area where you do get far more ability to flex up or down is where you're looking at the innovation and business development. And I think the key thing for us there is once again capital discipline.",
            "Which of the projects are going to give us the best return, and how quickly are they going to give us that return? One of the things that's been very helpful is we brought John Gibbs in as the new CIO probably about a year ago now, and John has really revolutionized what we've been doing with IT spend. And so one of the interesting facets of this is when you look at a reduction in IT spend, you might think that, therefore, means by definition we're doing less IT. I think one of the things John has enabled us to do is be far more efficient with our IT spend, which has also helped us. So John has really reinvigorated that area. He's taking it forward. We do have ambitious plans but at the same time we are trying to cut our cloth accordingly.",
            "In terms of short-haul versus long-haul fleet, I'm going to have to leave you to do the math on that one. So you'll have the Capital Markets Day slides from November. You will have seen the fleet retirements. And I think we've given you the fleet deliveries in this deck, so a little bit of simple arithmetic should be able to get you to the answer on that one."

            "On Virgin, but before I actually comment just to reinforce what Steve said about IT, I think one of the great things that John has done since he came in is to be able to retarget where we're spending our money in a sensible way. And he did this pause in activity and has actually given us an opportunity to avoid doing certain things, and thereby, save money but more importantly put us in a position where we can make better structural moves going forward.",
            "So Steve is quite right. It's not that we're just cutting spend on IT. We're spending the money in a much more efficient manner. And I think John has made a very significant difference in the business since he joined.",
            "On Virgin I always felt that they would be rescued. I didn't believe that they would disappear. And it's clear that they're going to focus on their -- I suppose was their traditional core activity which was transatlantic, so still heavily influenced by decision-making in Atlanta. And I think that will continue to be the driving force between what happens with Virgin but we fully expect them to be a consistently strong competitor against BA not the most efficient as I've said, but they provide strong competition. And that will continue to be the case going forward."

            "Good morning guys. Sorry to prolong the call. Two hopefully quick ones from me. Firstly, in response to Andrew's question about the reawakening that needs to happen on the transatlantic for cash breakeven in Q4, Willie you said, obviously it's based on the capacity guidance of ASKs down 46% year-on-year in Q4. Can I just push you for more thoughts on what you've assumed in that base case for the transatlantic? Because I'd have thought it's quite binary either President Trump reopens the border or he doesn't. And presumably a view on if and when that happens determines whether or not you'll be ramping up your services, so any extra insight on what you've assumed there would be helpful.",
            "And then secondly slide 36 gives us IAG's downside scenario for ASKs next year down 35% versus 2019. Is there a base case equivalent for ASKs 2021? Apologies if I've missed that. Thanks."

      "76": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Thank you. So on the transatlantic, I don't think it's quite as binary as you say because we are actually flying into North America at the moment, but the restrictions in place on who can fly into North America. So the flights are operating. We're operating significant passenger and cargo flights. They're typically operating with load seat factors. They are all cash positive at the moment.",
            "Our view is that we're not going to see a total reopening. So it's not on or off. What we'll see is a gradual reopening with certain markets being open and some being restricted. That's the assumptions we have at the moment. So that we will continue to serve the destinations that we're currently serving.",
            "And as you know passenger operations into the U.S. are restricted to certain gateway airports at the moment. I think all, but one of those airports we currently serve. So it assumes a gradual reopening and a staged reopening with certain cities being served and other cities still being closed for operations. So it's not quite the binary situation that you suggest where it's either all closed or all opened.",

            "Yeah. So your question about base case versus the commercial downside case. For 2020 full year, the base case was 59% as you can see and the downside case was 66%. And for 2021, base case was negative 24% versus negative 35% on the commercial downside case. Those -- all of those figures are versus 2019. We outlined some of that in the IMR document that we've issued this morning. But I would just hasten to add as I described earlier in the presentation, there are an awful lot of assumptions that go into that commercial downside case over and above the ASKs, not least of which unit revenue which is then built on the regional buildups, what the fleet financing assumptions are, what the cost mitigations are. So, there's a danger of looking at it just from one perspective of just ASKs. There's multifaceted set of assumptions to get to a commercial downside case."

So, coming back for the rights issue a question regarding timing and apologies if I missed any of your previous comments, can you guide us through your thinking in doing the rights issue in September instead of waiting until having more visibility on the recovery?",

What we are trying to do is to renegotiate that agreement because, we understand that in the current environment, it doesn't make sense to do the transactions -- the transaction sorry with the conditions that we agreed. So we are now in the middle of a negotiation with Air Europa. And as I explained before, if we can arrive to a place where the transaction makes sense for us, we will do it. We are sure that this operation gives a strategic and financial value for the group, but also we are conscious of the situation that we have right now and that the price that we agreed last November is not valid anymore in this context."

            "On the other two questions, in terms of the timing, the timing is interesting on this transaction because it's a more elongated process than maybe say U.K. rights issue. The -- this is primarily done under the Spanish regulation. And so, although we're announcing it today, it won't be until mid-September that we can basically launch this. So, that's quite a long period of time.",
            "So, in terms of timing we've had to factor that in and because of that long period of time, we've also had to put a standby underwrite in place because of market volatility. And also our key reference shareholder Qatar Airways has also given us an irrevocable commitment. So, when we think about timing on this transaction, it takes longer than a normal U.K. rights issue. And one of the things we wanted to do was to as you've touched on bolster the balance sheet and bolster the liquidity in case there is a prolonged downturn.",
            "In terms of how we're feeling about the balance sheet and the level of leverage, clearly this makes a big step in the right direction. It offsets largely the increase in debt or net debt that we've incurred during Q2. I think, it will take time to return to investment grade. That's not going to happen quickly, but this is a significant step in the right direction.",
            "And it also -- by re-equitizing the balance sheet like this, also gives us other options that we wouldn't have if we hadn't gone this route and maybe we just raised more debt. So, I'm comfortable would be the wrong word. I don't think this time is a comfortable time in any way shape or form, but I think it's the right way forward. And I think it puts us in a much stronger place and gives us more flexibility."
