         "Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the MacroGenics conference call to discuss our second quarter 2020 financial and operational results. For anyone who has not had the chance to review these results, we issued a press release this afternoon outlining today's announcement, which is available under the Investors tab on our website at macrogenics.com. You may listen to this conference call via webcast on our website where it is archived for 30 days beginning approximately 2 hours after the call is completed.",

         "Thank you, Scott. This afternoon, MacroGenics reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, which highlight our financial position as well as our recent progress. As described in our release, MacroGenics total revenue consisting primarily of revenue from collaborative agreements was $20.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared to $10.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the recognition of a $12 million payment from Boehringer Ingelheim under a 2010 license and collaboration agreement. Our research and development expenses were $57.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared to $51.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in development and clinical trial costs for multiple programs.",
         "General and administrative expenses were $10.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared to $12.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in consulting costs with a smaller decrease in travel-related costs due to COVID-19. MacroGenics net loss was $46.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared to a net loss of $31.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019.",
         "Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2020, were $232.8 million compared to $215.8 million as of December 31, 2019. During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we received $96.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately 4 million shares of our common stock pursuant to an at the market or ATM offering. Subsequent to June 30, 2020, we received an additional $21.3 million in net proceeds from sale of approximately 726,000 shares pursuant to the ATM as well as the earlier mentioned $12 million from Boehringer Ingelheim.",
         "I'll point out that as of June 30, 2020, the $12 million from BI was reflected on our balance sheet as a receivable. Finally, we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2020, plus the additional proceeds just described, which we subsequently received, combined with anticipated and potential collaboration payments should enable us to fund our operations into 2023, assuming the company's programs and collaborations advance as currently contemplated. This represents an extension of our previously reported cash runway guidance.",
         "I'll now turn the call back to Scott."

         "Good afternoon. We will begin the MacroGenics 2020 Second quarter Corporate Progress and Financial Results Conference Call in just a moment. [Operator Instructions] At this point, ",
         "I will turn the call over to Anna Krassowska, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications of MacroGenics."
      ],
      "Scott Koenig": [
         "Thank you, Anna. I'd like to welcome everyone participating via conference call and webcast today. This afternoon, I will provide key highlights from our clinical programs. But before I do so, let me first turn the call over to Jim Karrels, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review our financial results for the quarter.",
         "Thank you, Jim. We are excited about the momentum we have built to date in 2020 as well as the events we are anticipating during the remainder of the year and into 2021. I would like to begin by introducing Stephen Eck. As we announced, Stephen joined us at the beginning of July as our Senior Vice President of Clinical Development and Chief Medical Officer. Stephen is a hematologist oncologist by training with broad leadership experience in the development and commercialization of oncology therapeutics, and we are excited to have him on the team. Assets that he has managed include enzalutamide, erlotinib and gilteritinib. Stephen is with us on the call today and will join us for the Q&A portion. Welcome, Stephen.",
         "Thank you, Stephen. I will start with flotetuzumab, an investigational bispecific CD123 x CD3 DART molecule and our most recent product candidate to date in a registration study. Informed by discussions with the FDA, this trial will be a single-arm study in up to 200 AML patients whose disease is either refractory to induction treatment, which we refer to as primary induction failure or as relapsed early within 6 months after an initial response. The study will be conducted as an expansion of the ongoing Phase I/II study. The primary endpoint is response rate comprised of complete remission and complete remissions with partial hematological recovery or CRH. We plan to submit updated study data for presentation at a scientific conference in the fourth quarter of 2020.",
         "In June, research led by Dr. Sergio Rutella at the John van Geest Cancer Research Center in the U.K., was published in science translational medicine and describes an immunological signature related to interferon gamma gene expression in the tumor microenvironment. In patients with primary refractory or early relapsed AML, this gene signature appears to be predictive of resistance to chemotherapy, yet associated with response to flotetuzumab treatment. These data provide a molecular basis to understand why AML patients who are refractory to chemotherapy may be responsive to immunotherapy with flotetuzumab.",
         "Moving on to MGC018, our investigational antibody drug conjugate designed to deliver a DNA alkylating, duocarmycin cytotoxic payload to cells that express B7-H3. Initial dose escalation data for the ongoing Phase I study was very well received at the ASCO Virtual Annual Meeting. Of particular interest was the early evidence of clinical activity observed in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer or MCRPC. Reductions in PSA levels of 50% or more were observed in 5 of 7 patients including 1 with substantial regression of bone disease. The safety profile of MGC018, which includes hematologic and skin toxicities as expected has been manageable. The patients with prostate cancer reported at ASCO were enrolled at a 2 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg dose cohorts. Since ASCO, we have completed the planned dose escalation up to 4 mg/kg and selected 3mg/kg as the recommended dose for expansion based on pharmacokinetic analysis. In the third quarter, we expect to begin dose expansion in patients with metastatic CRPC with a target enrollment of up to 40 patients.",
         "Next, I would like to turn to initial data related to MGD013, our investigational bispecific PD-1 x LAG-3 DART molecule, also presented at ASCO. In the ongoing Phase I dose expansion study, the data presented showed antitumor activity of MGD013 as monotherapy across several tumor types evaluated. Initial translational studies have indicated that response to MGD013 monotherapy was associated with LAG-3 expression and a gamma-interferon gene signature in tumor samples taken at baseline, a finding that we are investigating further. We have previously observed that LAG-3 expression on immune effector cells is enhanced by margetuximab, our investigational Fc-engineered monoclonal antibody targeting HER2. Therefore, we included an expansion cohort of patients with advanced HER2-positive tumors treated with a combination of MGD013 and margetuximab. Of the 14 evaluable patients treated with this combination, we observed confirmed and non-confirmed objective responses in 6 or 30 -- 43% of patients.",
         "In contrast to the monotherapy finding presented at ASCO, in the combination cohort, the majority of responders with baseline tumors were evaluated, were either negative 4 were expressed low levels of LAG-3 or PD-L1. Given this strong but early efficacy signal and acceptable safety profile, we are prioritizing the combination of MGD013 and margetuximab for further development. We are enrolling 3 subgroups of patients with HER2-positive tumors, one with gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, one with breast cancer, and finally, a basket of all other HER2-positive cancer types. We are initially targeting 30 patients in each group. We believe that combining Fc-engineering and checkpoint blockade has the potential to engage both innate and adaptive immune responses against a broad range of tumors with varied tumor microenvironments.",
         "With regard to margetuximab, the BLA for margetuximab in combination with chemotherapy as a treatment for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, the PDUFA target action date of December 18, 2020. As previously announced, during the mid-cycle communication with the U.S. FDA, they notified us they no longer plan to hold an ODAC meeting to discuss the BLA. Beyond breast cancer, the Phase II/III MAHOGANY study is evaluating margetuximab and checkpoint blockade as a frontline treatment for advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer. Module A, the single-arm part of the MAHOGANY study of margetuximab and retifanlimab, an investigational anti-PD-1 antibody is enrolling, and we expect to submit initial data for presentation at a scientific conference in the first quarter of 2021. Module B, the randomized component of MAHOGANY, is currently planned to start the fourth quarter of 2020.",
         "Let me next discuss MGD019, our investigational bispecific PD-1 x CTLA-4 DART molecule. We are excited to have data from the Phase I dose escalation study of MGD019 selected for an oral presentation at the ESMO Virtual Congress in September. The study is ongoing in an all-comer population with advanced cancers. We have not restricted the study to tumor types that are known to respond to checkpoint inhibitors. Dose cohorts ranged from 0.03 to 10 mg/kg. Additional patients have been enrolled more recently at 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, dose levels of which we observed initial clinical activity. The data continues to mature with some patients early in their treatment course. By the time of the data cutoff date for the presentation at ESMO, we anticipate up to a total of 30 patients will be evaluable for response, having had at least 1 on treatment scan. Note that this number includes patients enrollment treated at all doses with approximately 18 enrolled at 3 mg/kg and above.",
         "Let me next turn to retifanlimab, previously known as MGA012, the investigational anti-PD-1 antibody that we license to Incyte. At ESMO, data are scheduled to be presented from Incyte's ongoing POD1UM-201 study of retifanlimab monotherapy in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma. Those data are in addition to the data expected in the second half of the year from POD1UM-202 Incyte's potentially registration enabled study in patients with anal cancer which is fully enrolled. Furthermore, we expect Incyte to initiate 2 Phase III studies in 2020, POD1UM-304 in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and POD1UM-303 in patients with anal cancer, both in combination with chemotherapy. In all, there are currently 6 registration-direct clinical studies ongoing or planned in 2020 by either MacroGenics or Incyte across a broad range of tumor types.",
         "Last but not least, we are pleased that our second antibody-drug conjugate is expected to enter clinical testing this year. We recently received FDA clearance of the Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for IMGC936, an ADC targeting ADAM9 that is being advanced under a co-development agreement with ImmunoGen. Under this 50-50 collaboration, ImmunoGen will be leading clinical development, and they expect to initiate a Phase I dose escalation study in patients with select advanced solid tumors in the fourth quarter of 2020. For background, ADAM9, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain containing protein 9 is a cell surface antigen that is overexpressed in very solid tumor types and has been shown to correlate with core prognosis in several cancers. This regulation of ADAM9 has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis as well as pathological neovascularization. Anti\u2013ADAM9 antibodies are efficiently internalized and degraded by ADAM9 expressing tumors, making it an attractive ADC target for delivering a cytotoxic payload. IMGC936 is comprised of a humanized antibody engineered by MacroGenics, conjugated in a site-specific manner to a DM21, a next-generation linker/payload designed by ImmunoGen. This molecule combines a maytansinoid microtubule-disrupting payload with a peptide linker that is designed to convey greater stability and bystander activity than other DM platforms. The drug antibody ratio, or DAR, is 2.",

         "Remarks": [
            "Could you talk to the ability to get to higher doses with MGD019? Is it an engineered lower affinity for CTLA-4? Or do you need engagement of both PD-1 x CTLA-4 on the T-cells, which allows you to kind of circumvent the GI tox?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Debjit Chattopadhyay"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "The molecule was designed very specifically to get maximum engagement of PD-1. As you remember, this was a tetravalent bispecific molecule. And so the affinity is a slight increase on PD-1 to get initial engagement with that and because there are 2 binding sites for CTLA-4, you get an NVIDIA advantage for then binding the CTLA-4 site. So in essence, we are getting optimum of recognition of cells that express both receptors. You also see, obviously, binding to cells that express PD-1 alone and occasionally ones that have only CTLA-4, but it was really designed as a way to enhance engagement of these co-expressing cell types. Could we go higher than 10 mg/kg? It certainly could. But we found, as we will discuss at the ESMO presentation, is that we're in a very optimal range. We're seeing clinical responsiveness across multiple doses. What we have previously reported are seeing responses between 3 and 10 mg/kg, #1. And secondly, we saw activation markers associated with these therapeutic responses. So we see no need to expand the treatment above 10 mg/kg."

Also wondering about whether LAG-3 expression might inform your plans for potentially accelerating in the marge plus L1-2 combo in the study?"

And certainly, as we get more data from the MGD013 monotherapy study alone, in terms of determining which biomarkers are best predictable for responsiveness, and that could be expanded beyond LAG-3 x PDL-1 and other activation markers.

Do you retake that as a direct read through to the likelihood of success there? And secondly, do we have any color on when that registrational cohort for flotetuzumab, when that 200-patient cohort could get started? And if so, when you might expect data from them?"

            "Thanks, Jonathan, for the question. So with regard to the ad com, it's very difficult to interpret what the thinking is from the FDA. I would say that given this was at mid-cycle review many months before or whatever the time ad com, we perceive this as a very favorable response, but I can't speak for the FDA in that context. And similarly, the questions that we had gotten at that time and subsequently, suggests that they're continuing to have interest in evaluating this and evaluating this for an approval. But again, it's in the hands of the FDA. I can't comment on that.",
            "With regard to the registration study for flotetuzumab. As I had previously reported, we had made modifications on the Phase I/II program. And so we have not stopped enrollment in that trial and including the patients with a specific pretreatment regimens that we've aligned with, with the FDA. And so that is, in fact, ongoing right now. Our expectation right now is that we will have some update on data for patients that we have treated from the previous ASH meeting last December. Hopefully, if our abstract is accepted at the ASH meeting this year. So we'll be able to provide interim update on some additional data of patients being treated, and then our hope is to complete the enrollment not later than the end of next year, assuming that the enrollment goes as planned."

And then aside from that, regarding teplizumab, which we actually sold to Provention Bio, we have the ability to receive a $60 million milestone upon BLA approval of that asset, which the BLA is in the process of being submitted now on a rolling basis, and we anticipate a likely PDUFA date of sometime middle of next year. We handicap all of these milestones to the extent it makes sense, and then we -- that's what we budget. So we tend to value this fairly conservatively. Yes. I think I'll just leave it at that."

We had performed pharmacokinetic analysis since our last call. And we found that, in fact, what I had predicted that we would see suitable PK between 2 and 3 mg/kg would be acceptable to move things forward. So we selected the 3 mg/kg dose.

Obviously, ongoing support for March for the BLA, the flotetuzumab registration study, the studies on MGD013 in combination, in particular, the expansion there. We are moving forward, obviously, in the new program with ADAM9 with ImmunoGen. And then clearly, additional data from '19 would likely come next year with follow-up on the current patients. So it's all -- obviously, what I just described with expansion cohorts on '18. So I think this is fitting in quite nicely with our plans going forward and the additional cash giving us additional runway. I think we'll have a very robust pipeline to be able to report new data in the next 6 months to 9 months with these added patients."

We've actually observed that in some of the patients in the earlier Phase I study. So this is very much in the hope that if we can get a significant number of these patients to transplant, our experience to date is that they've lived much longer lives, and there's always the possibility of cure. So this is obviously a very -- a big objective for this study."

And again, a significant portion of those patients, even if we hit the 40, would not be evaluable because they would come later in the year. So a lot of this will be timing of when those patients come in. I'm pleased that, despite the COVID-19, we've been able to enroll additional patients in the U.S. Now we have 11 sites opened in Korea. And so we're hoping that there's a greater influx of patients coming into the trial from those Korean sites to get to the 40 by the end of the year. If we have that and have it sufficiently early enough in 2020, then it's likely we would be able to report this out early in 2021 and make some decisions about how to further accelerate this trial to get it enrolled. But we'll provide updates during the course of the year on how that's going."

And so we would like to understand how robust that signal is by adding additional late-stage gastric patients in that combination study for -- in the 13 trial. Clearly, in the MAHOGANY B, we're looking at newly diagnosed patients, so it's a completely different population. And in fact, as we get those combination studies, the late-line therapy, if that data is completely robust, it even gives us more impetus to accelerate the MAHOGANY B. Remember though, the difference is that in MAHOGANY B, we're adding chemotherapy to that arm. So there will be differences irrespective of that and getting to understand what the effect of adding chemo to those immune-based therapies."

Obviously, in the Lutetium trial, recently, they had a response rate, I guess, about 66%, but that's obviously already a labeled drug. Our goal, clearly, is, is if we could achieve responses comparable to what we've seen in the Phase I study would be ideal. But right now, we haven't given specifics with regards to the range that ultimately would determine how we would take this further. I think that by enrolling up to 40 patients as we've just recently described, we should get a good idea on how good this drug is."

Remember that historical data suggests on a PFS rate of currently approved drugs, we're talking about 2 to 3 months with a survival in this late-stage population of around a year depending on the study, a little less or a little more. So obviously, if we exceed those parameters, plus have a persistence of reduction of PSA of greater than 50% very early and prolonged, I think we'll be in pretty good shape with regard to the drug."

And what we have seen to date as up-regulated many of the activation markers, including LAG-3 x PD-L1 and other checkpoints. And so given that the Fc-engineered an ublituximab molecule which is -- has the exact same Fc modulation as margetuximab and also induces the same up-regulation of these markers in some of our in vitro studies, we expect to design combination studies with MGD013 within abituzumab, and we will be updating later this year on the specific design and the start of those studies, which is likely to occur in 2021."
