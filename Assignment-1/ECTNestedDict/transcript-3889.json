      "Ghislain Houle": [
         "Yes. Thanks, Keith.",
         "Overall, the point I'd like to make is that our strong balance sheet and disciplined cost management allowed us to manage well during a challenging time, while continuing to invest for the future.",
         "Starting on page 12 of the presentation, I will summarize the key financial highlights of our second quarter performance as we continue to provide essential services to move the North America -- the North American economy.",
         "Revenues for the quarter were down 19% versus last year at just over $3.2 billion. As part of our continued efforts on PSR and asset rationalization, we recorded a non-cash charge of $486 million in the quarter, resulting from the decision to market for sale certain non-core lines for ongoing rail operations.",
         "Our adjusted operating ratio is 60.4%, up 290 basis points versus last year. Adjusted net income was $908 million or $342 million lower than last year, with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.28, down 26% versus last year. The impact of foreign currency was favorable by $13 million on net income in the quarter or $0.02 of EPS.",
         "Turning to page 13, let me highlight a few of our key expense categories on a constant currency basis. Labor and fringe benefit expense was 18% lower than last year. Overall headcount at the end of the second quarter was down 5,100, a 19% decrease year-over-year. Purchased services and material expense was 11% lower than last year. This was mostly the result of lower outsource services, trucking and transload and material expenses. Fuel expense was 49% lower than last year, driven by a 39% decrease in price, 20% lower workload and an all-time record fuel efficiency.",
         "Now, moving to cash on page 14. Despite a very challenging demand environment, I'm extremely pleased that we generated over $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and close to $1.6 billion through the end of June, nearly double the amount generated for the same period last year. We are the best railroad to go through this unprecedented pandemic with the highest investment grade credit rating in the industry. And in late June, Moody's reaffirmed CN\u2019s credit rating of A2 with stable outlook.",
         "In fact, our leverage in terms of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of June was lower versus what we reported at the end of Q1. We have plenty of liquidity. And we continue to issue commercial paper at rates that are lower than LIBOR. We opportunistically priced on April 29, a $600 million 30-year bond at a coupon of 2.45%, the lowest rate achieved by a Class I railroad and the second lowest ever by any corporate in the U.S. debt capital markets. The Company will continue to pause its share repurchases in these economic circumstances and will reassess on an ongoing basis.",
         "Let me finish by saying that as you know, we withdrew our guidance for the year on our last earnings call. We are still not providing guidance at this time, which is consistent with most companies in North America. Our scenario analysis for free cash flow that we provided in Q1 still holds.",
         "So, to sum up, during this quarter from a financial perspective, we have clearly demonstrated the resiliency of our franchise, delivering value to our long-term shareholders. On this note, back to JJ?"
      ],
      "JJ Ruest": [
         "Thank you, Paul. And good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call.",
         "In keeping with our commitment to safety and essential services, our people have quickly pivoted to working safely under the new normal of COVID-19. In Q1, we told you about our proven ability to be resilient to any challenges. In Q2, we proved it again, and CN\u2019s operation never slowed down for the pandemic. And we will be ready and prepared if there is a second wave.",
         "As we look back, this was among the toughest quarter of my career with heightened pandemic concern of our employees and a sharp drop in volume of 18% in revenue ton miles. But thanks to our people and our leaders, we performed very well. We take pride in delivering essential services to our national economies. Our perennial financial strength is serving us very well in these current times. CN generated $1 billion free cash flow during a quarter of severe recession. We delivered an adjusted operating ratio of 60.4% and we caution you to aim for a minimum of $2.5 billion of free cash flow this year. CN is built to last. And even in these challenging times, I'm proud that we continued to demonstrate why ESG is a hallmark of CN. Namely, our carbon footprint continued to decrease having delivered another record of fuel efficiency.",
         "Today, we will speak for the short term, our costs and our resiliency to last this pandemic. And today, we will also speak to our investment in the long term and our contribution to the economic recovery.",
         "Rob will walk you through the strength of our operation in this new normal. He will highlight progress we are continuing to make and cost takeout and bringing technology to the railroad industry and then the safety culture at CN. He will also highlight his outstanding performance in fuel efficiency.",
         "James and Keith will speak to the expected sequential volume trend for the quarters ahead. And we know also by now you know our long-term commitment to the grain business and the management investment that we've announced here today.",
         "Ghislain will give you color on our solid balance sheet and the special non-cash charge that we are using to PSR further by trimming non-core parts of our network.",
         "So in summary, a good quarter in the middle of a recession. We quickly learned how to operate under the new normal of COVID-19 for quarters to come. We proved again our cost resiliency that will help us deliver in the near term. And we reaffirmed our confidence in the future by maintaining our dividend policy, reaffirming our $2.9 billion CapEx in 2020, and announcing a new $150 million investment for 2021, targeting the long-term grain export business.",
         "On that note, I will pass it on to Rob. Rob?",
         "Thank you, team, and thank you, Ghislain.",
         "Let me wrap this up before the Q&A. So, as we speak here, our operations are fluid, volume is sequentially slowly improving, and we are carefully recalling some train crews and about to resume some training for the 2021 demand. As we look ahead, we remain bullish, and we also have a culture of resiliency. This quarter should give you no doubt that we are ready for anything. Whether or not the world goes back to normal in six months or we have a prolonged pandemic, we have the team to get this done.",
         "With that Patrick will now take it over to get questions. Thank you."
      ],
      "James Cairns": [
         "Thank you, Rob.",
         "Like all Class I railways, we saw a significant decrease in demand related to the pandemic. At the same time, thanks to our unique geographic reach, we set all-time record in the quarter for Canadian coal, Canadian grain, West Coast propane and wood pellets. Prince Rupert gives us a structural advantage that cannot be replicated and creates supply chain resiliency that helps our customers win in their end markets in good times and bad. We set new records for grain for the last four consecutive months. Our customers have invested heavily in new country elevators on CN and new export capacity in Vancouver.",
         "In order to support these investments, we will be acquiring 1,500 additional high-capacity hopper cars for 2021. That would create the capacity for us to continue to set new records for Western Canadian grain through next year.",
         "These new high-capacity cars allow us to ship up to 20% more wheat and 40% more canola, using the same train resources, creating an overweighted benefit for CN, giving the commodity mix of our business. Wood pellets in particular was a good new story in Q2. Our year-over-year volume growth of about 15% has come from expansion projects across British Columbia and Alberta with more production coming on line through the end of 2020.",
         "We set an all-time record for West Coast export propane volume in the second quarter and reached a new sustainable run rate of 70 cars per day, working with our partners Altagas and Ridley Terminals.",
         "The CN Prince Rupert supply chain offers propane producers access to the best netback markets in Asia, and we expect to see continued growth in West Coast propane exports via Prince Rupert through the balance of this year and next, as Altagas guests continues to set new records and Pembina starts up their new facility early in 2021.",
         "Coal unloads at Ridley terminals of 3.2 million tons for the quarter was an all-time record as well. West Coast coal volume was up over 22% in Q2 compared to the previous year. There is a slow sequential recovery in our manifest franchise, and we expect that May was a low watermark for our carload business.",
         "Our lumber franchise in particular started to recover late in Q2 with commodity pricing improving by around 40% from April to June. We expect to see sequential growth for the balance of the year and now seeing demand at pre-COVID levels.",
         "The crude oil price war and demand disruption caused by the pandemic severely impacted our crude, frac sand and fuels business much more than our general manifest and bulk business. We're seeing demand come back for diesel, ethanol and frac sand with sequential growth from Q2 into Q3. We continue to invest in lockstep with our customers to facilitate carload growth. This is made possible by our continued ability to price ahead of railway cost inflation across all business units at CN.",
         "I'll now turn it over to Keith."
      ],
      "Keith Reardon": [
         "Thanks, James.",
         "The reach and scale of our network and the variety of products and services that we offer have allowed for our consumer businesses to be resilient in the face of volatile demand. The acquisitions of H&R and TransX have amplified our industry-leading refrigerated services. This allowed us to grow in the consumer and grocery freight weights that we saw in Q2. CN\u2019s wholesale partners were also able to drive growth in these segments.",
         "Our Q2 overseas business fared well in the face of lowered consumer demand and significant transpacific blank sailings by the ocean shipping industry. We see significant volumes for July and August on the West Coast. And Prince Rupert could see a record in July, as carriers reinstitute vessel calls previously scheduled for blanking in Q3. We also see additional vessels being scheduled for ad hoc service as containers sitting on the docks in Asia require more capacity. Strong customer relationships and our extensive network reach has helped CN to win a large portion of these reinstituted and ad hoc vessel calls for Q3.",
         "Grain records were not only set in James' carload segment, in June we moved 60% more containerized grain versus Q2 of last year. The success of the grain container terminal in Regina has been a great addition to the network. Our CSX steel wheel interchanges from the ports of New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia sequentially grew in Q2. In automotive, we are now seeing a welcomed rebound in volumes with the majority of the plants we service continuing to produce during what would otherwise be the traditional summer shutdown. As JJ said, we're focusing on the long term, even as we deliver results during challenging times.",
         "We're focusing on costs, rightsizing resources and assets in our multimodal operations. Initiatives are underway in intermodal terminals, our auto ports, as well as our subsidiary operations. Our supply chain partners continue to invest in the long-term future of our ecosystems. For example, in Vancouver DP World center is bringing on more rail capacity as we speak. And in Halifax, the Super-Post-Panamax crane was delivered to PSA a few weeks ago.",
         "CN\u2019s reach and network scale, the diversity of service offerings and the structural and capacity improvements that we and our supply chain partners are implementing, will produce mid to long-term growth from the consumer businesses.",
         "I'll now pass on to Ghislain for the financial perspective. "

         "I would now like to turn the meeting over to Paul Butcher, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Butcher."
      ],
      "Paul Butcher": [
         "Well, thank you, Patrick. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us for CN's second quarter 2020 earnings call. I would like to remind you about the comments already made regarding forward-looking statements.",
         "With me today is JJ Ruest, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Ghislain Houle, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Reilly, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Keith Reardon, our Senior Vice President, Consumer Product Supply Chain; and James Cairns, our Senior Vice President, Rail Centric Supply Chain.",
         "I do want to remind you to please limit yourself to one question so that everyone has the opportunity to participate in the Q&A session. The IR team will be available after the call for any follow-up questions.",
         "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to CN's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. JJ Ruest."
      ],
      "Rob Reilly": [
         "All right. Thank you, JJ.",
         "Our results in the second quarter are showing you the strength of our CN team and of our operating model. In these extraordinary times, the team reacted quickly and aggressively. We adjusted resources to declining volumes, increased productivity and efficiency, and served our customers, all of that while improving our overall safety record with less injuries and less accidents on a year-to-date basis. Finally, we will see some lasting structural changes following COVID-19 and I'll provide you with some of those examples.",
         "I'm very proud of the CN team that proved again our culture of operational resiliency as we are leading the industry on many fronts. Now, let me walk you through some of the details.",
         "During the quarter, the team responded accordingly to the significant volume drops in rightsizing our resources, by idling four locomotive shops, as well as four additional switching yards. We laid up one out of every three locomotives, over 20,000 railcars were stored while our active online car inventory was down 20%, and approximately 4,000 employees were furloughed this year.",
         "From a productivity standpoint for the second quarter, the team set an all-time best ever fuel efficiency record while avoiding an additional 29,000 tons of CO2 emissions and saving an additional $7 million in fuel expense, directly from our fuel efficiency initiatives and execution. Sequentially, fuel efficiency improved 8% from last quarter. That means, we moved 8% more tonnage, the same distance with the same amount of fuel.",
         "We continue to be the North American Class I railroad leader in fuel efficiency using a little more than eight-tenths of a gallon of fuel per 1,000 gross ton miles. Train weight and train lengths reached all-time historic levels as we're able to move more freight on every train start. Crew starts were reduced 21% while RTMs were down 18%. Crew productivity exceeded all-time record levels and train speed was up 5% year-over-year. As I noted last quarter, we also took advantage of the additional time on our tracks with fewer trains operating to strengthen our infrastructure. As a result, we've seen our rail un-tagging [ph] productivity improve up to 25% year-over-year.",
         "Also, as I've mentioned previously, from a mechanical standpoint, we reacted with a plan and a purpose by laying up our least reliable locomotives first and laying them up in good order status that allows us to get them back into service quicker, when needed. During the quarter, we've seen locomotive reliability and availability percentages improved year-over-year, while locomotive dwell was reduced, fully utilizing our assets while doing it with fewer shops and less headcount. You can see that we once again demonstrated our culture of operational resiliency, even during a tough quarter, and we continue to look ahead to further improve our efficiency through challenging times.",
         "Now, let me highlight some of the initiatives we are building on, and that will provide lasting structural changes. The idled locomotive shops and switching yards will remain closed. We will continue to improve train size year-over-year. Fuel efficiency initiatives will continue to produce record outcomes. More of our training will be performed virtually. And we continue to advance the capability of our handheld mobile devices that all train crews have now. Through this digitization process, we have and are eliminating some 30 million printed pages of paper annually at CN, removing hundreds of shared printers and kiosk terminals while reducing the COVID-related exposures associated with them. Further on a technology forefront, our automated track inspection program in automated inspection portals continue to provide benefits with our train accident ratio reduced 22% year-over-year.",
         "Finally, our operations team is tied very closely with James and Keith's teams, matching resources to projected sequential volume return, and we are ready and prepared for additional waves of COVID.",
         "With that, I will turn it over to James."

Can you help us to understand how you're thinking of near shoring as a potential maybe risk to the growth of international intermodal over time? How does CN and your port partners kind of continue to add value? And maybe if you can share what kind of discussions you're having with your shipper customers on potentially moving their supply chains to North America?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. So, let me start. So, we are very bullish on the strength of the consumer in North America, even more so on the consumer living in the U.S. in a big city because we have a three coast network and we can access some of the highly populated area. And the consumer disposable income is really key to CN\u2019s future. And the product that's most-suited to exploit the consumer spending and disposable income is intermodal. And the business coming by the port is definitely one of our mid to long-term strategy to increase our business in that space, in two ways. One is to try to earn market share. It is a North American market. The border does not exist when it comes to supply chain. And therefore, we're looking to outperform that economy, which would be outperformed -- the part of the GDP that's related to the consumer and play a big role in the U.S. market and competing hard with East Coast and West Coast railroad, and East Coast and West Coast and West Coast port.",

Those that supply their needs, whether it\u2019s retail or manufacturing in North America, they've been not only looking to China over the years, but they've also been sourcing products from Southeast Asia, and that is still growing. Those plants are still being built. And what we're seeing is the farther south you go, the more economically feasible it is to maybe go through the Suez Canal and then going to the East Coast. So, that is one of our strategies, as you know, is the, three coast access that we have at CN, which is unique than any other railroad does not have that. And, that is why we have the strategies in place of Halifax, Quebec City, that's why we see all of these infrastructure projects on the East Coast for us as risk mitigation I guess, and as an aggressive standpoint to go attract that business to North America through the gateways that we service on our three coasts."

      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So, maybe to wrap this up, Ravi, to answer your question directly, as opposed to regarding near shoring. I think, the reality is, they will be in-country sourcing for all this stuff that's deemed to be essential for a country, medical device, eventually vaccine and anything related that's bought by a government who are going to be willing to pay more for those goods that are essential to the current time. But, when it comes to consumer product, it's still going to be quality price. And the consumer is going to look at the price tag, number one; the quality, number two and the country of origin, maybe sometime and maybe most of the time, probably not. So I think, near-shoring of day-to-day consumer goods, especially the lower value one, that's not going to happen. But, if it's a very-high value goods, that is something electronic or a computer chip, yes, the labor cost, you could do that. Remember, the U.S. dollar is very strong. And that's a bit of a challenge to bring in manufacturing back in North America."

We are doing it weekly, biweekly in terms of keeping our employees cut in that are on furlough. And as far as our locomotives, we did that with the purpose. As we laid up locomotives, we laid up the least reliable, and we laid them up in places where we could get to them quickly. So, we remain very tactical throughout this, Cherilyn, and we're ready for whichever way it -- whichever way it may go here."

And as we speak in July, the lumber business has picked up and we're calling back crews for in the lumber geographic market and putting cars in service. And the business on Rupert right now is very strong. That's another area where we are -- we have been recalling some crews selectively. Be very mindful of the cost, but at the same time, we are an enabler of economy, we're an enabler of the recovery.

And we've never really done it in the U.S. And these noncore lines came with -- when we bought the WC. They're really noncore lines in Wisconsin, there were noncore lines in Michigan and noncore lines in Ontario. Again, with the cost structure of a smaller operator, not a Class I railroad like us, and the ability that sometimes they have to get some funding from the government, I think they will be better suited to run these lines than we are. And as these lines will continue to feed in into our main line and continue to -- and will continue to benefit from the long haul.",

First use of cash is towards the business. And then, we'll look at shareholder distribution first and foremost, dividend. And I'm quite proud of our 7% dividend growth this year. I'm quite proud of the consistency of our dividend, which is 16% CAGR since we privatized.

But, what's important for us is for each carload to make money. And we measure that through revenue to cost ratio, the RCR, which is a reverse of an operating ratio. And when it comes to pricing, we don\u2019t look, as you know, on cent per RTM, because when you look at cent per RTM, you're looking at noise, or [indiscernible] change, mix, length of haul, you name it. I provide the car, the customer provides the car. What's really important when it comes to price is same store price, which is the same thing as a retailer does. This sale is here, compared to the same sale last year, what's my spread. And anything that doesn't -- is not a same store sales doesn't go into calculation of same store price because now it's a different sales, you don\u2019t have a comparable. And a lot of these different sales have a huge impact on what you call, the cent per RTM. So, that's why we're not focused on cent per RTM. We're focused on same store sales.

What that will mean is 50% less manual inspections. And what that means for us is that all around our autonomous track inspection program, it's really about, having a safer, more reliable network, it does reduce cost and it unlocks capacity on our network by embedding these in revenue service trains versus a human being on the track.",
            "So, in terms of quantifying it, we've seen our train accident ratio down 22% year-over-year. And certainly some of that can be traced back to that. We've tested the line in the U.S. 17 times more than traditional testing right now. So, in terms of strengthening the line, in terms of turning our employees into fixers versus finders, all of that is coming true.

So, we do have an exemption there to begin testing that and we'll continue to follow the same pattern that we had in the U.S.",

First of all, the -- I mean, at the end of the day, what we do on costs and what the team did, to your point, on the second quarter, is quite remarkable. And we've got to remember that we have some headwinds that are quite fixed that we have to deal with. And I've mentioned that at the beginning of the year. We have about $130 million of depreciation that we have to deal with. And we have another used to be $70 million on pension. Now with the betterment in pensionable payroll, it's down to 50, but it's still 50. So, we have $180 million of headwind. And if you slice that every quarter, this is cost that we have to deal with. So, I think that the proof will be in the pudding in Q3. I mean, as you know, and JJ made the point, we've never been enamored with OR at CN. I think that we'd rather be a $20 billion, 60% OR than $15 billion at 59. Just do the math. So, I think that at the end of the day, we will continue to manage costs, and we manage both the short-term and the long-term. So, we do make decisions on the -- to make sure that we know that our report cards coming out every three months and the -- the report card will come out in October. And you guys will look at the OR and all of the metrics.",

It wasn't fun going through the beginning of the second quarter and hearing about blank sailings and also the challenges that our customers were having and the fact that they thought that was going to be going into the third quarter as well. So, it's great that we've seen a lot of the blanks that they had for Q3. They've reinstituted those calls. And right now, on the West Coast, we have much less noise around the blank sailings than we did during Q2. In fact, they're adding 11 extra loaders in Q3 on the West Coast, -- 9 on the West Coast and 2 on the East Coast. Those types of things in the discussions that we have with our customers and the fact that our boots-on-the ground folks in Asia are telling us the strength of what's going on with orders from North America. Those give us the confidence that I can sit and talk to Rob and ask him -- have that discussion about being prepared. As I said, Rupert's probably going to have a record in July. And we see the same thing for August, as far as the volume solid on the West Coast."

Could you talk to whether some changes in mix or maybe just lower volume on the network allowed you to kind of extend that? And then, what the outlook should be kind of from here? Should we be expecting in this 9,000, 9,500 feet length range for the rest of the year, even through the winter months, or should we be expecting this to kind of maybe come off as volume comes back."

And mix or no mix, what we've done is really take what has been delivered to us and make the best out of it. So, we're looking at a significant volume drop that we saw this quarter and we took action. Part of that was increasing train size and reducing crew starts. And a lot of things come with that when you do that. Bigger trains lead to greater train fuel efficiency, leads to better utilization of your locomotives. We saw train velocity improve all during this period as well, 5% year-over-year. So, we plan on keeping trains big and looking for more opportunities that are out there."

And does this maintain CapEx in your more normalized range for 2021 or how should we think about it from that perspective?"

            "So, maybe I'll take the first part and Ghislain can talk about the CapEx of 2021, without getting too deep into details. So definitely, these railcars are more productive. Therefore, you can move -- as you know, the Canadian grain cap, you get paid by the ton mile. So, the more you can put in a car, you get more revenue per car. So, obviously, the yield of a car, which has a higher payload, or the profit yield of a train has a higher payload because each car is heavier and these cars are shorter, you make the business more profitable. That's why the business case is compelling to really invest long term in a grain business.",
            "So, it is profitable. It has a good return. And the new formula of the grain cap says, there is a really compelling case to renew your fleet. But, as long as that fleet has a higher payload, higher payload per train, higher payload per car, CN is a little more north than my competitor in terms of where we are in the Canadian prairies and a little more north, these little more canola. Canola is a is a lighter crop. And the impact on the revenue per car of a lighter crop of this different car is actually beneficial to us. We have a -- we even have a better return than if we were moving a lot of wheat, for example.",
            "In terms of revenue impact, without getting too deep into detail, you look at a book of business on Canadian grain, how we do usually, and obviously, we'd like to do more of that. And I think James, there was a decision issued by the Canadian government on the grain cap. And it's sort of favorable to the CN as of this year, in terms of the MRE."

Still, I think we're going to see -- we're going to look to see how the recovery and how the recovery sticks. It\u2019s still -- I think we see signs of it. But at this point, it's a little bit choppy. So, I would say, stay tuned on that one. I mean, we'll see in Q3 and then early Q4. We'll go through all of our bottom up, top down exercise. And obviously, we need to go to our Board and make sure that they approve our capital envelope. But, what I'm going to say to you is, the big two years of our CapEx investments of 25% of revenue is behind us. And I think that going forward, it'll be lower than that. And as you know, our historical rate has always been in the 20% range. But, we'll see. I mean, if we don't need to invest, we won't. And to JJ\u2018s point right now, with volumes that we have and two years of significant investments we've made, we've got plenty of capacity. And we're still now putting some this year on very-targeted areas in Rupert and very-targeted areas in Vancouver. And we have -- we're very pleased to have the help of other government or the port of Vancouver, same thing in Rupert with the government. So -- and those are dealing with specific pinch points that we have.",

            "Well, definitely, it has been special time between our labor disruption November, the rail blockade where we felt that we weren't getting whole lot of support even though we had injunction everywhere, and then right away having the pandemic. I think what it shows is CN resiliency is very strong. I mean, the management team that we have are down to people who run train, people who run train during the pandemic. People who -- a lot of people have the opportunity to stay home because of we're safer at home. We had to work very hard to make the working conditions such that everybody would keep coming to work. And by the way, even though our headquarters is somewhat empty, a lot of us kept coming in here. On average, I think we had 200 people report in this building here every day from day one and they still report to work every day since the beginning of this pandemic.",
            "So, what it does is it creates confidence. I think, it creates confidence that we can do with whatever comes at us. Whether we have a second wave of pandemic, which is possible, and we're ready and prepared for that or we have strong recovery, which we're ready and prepared for and hoping for. That would be a good thing. But we don't plan for the best; we plan for the worst, but then are ready to be exploiting whatever it might come at us.",
            "CN is focused on growth. So, we are always thinking in that line. So, as much as we work on our costs, because being a cost leader is quite important. We're also working on a pipeline of inorganic growth. And you heard that we have a new Chief Strategy Officer at CN. And Maureen, one of our Board members is heading a new Board committee on long-term strategy. And these two things are really to address some of the fundamental challenge there is in railroad is yes, from time-to-time we\u2019ll have disruption, pandemic, rail strike or a blockade. But, the real fundamental issue is how do we grow long-term as an industry, beyond coal, beyond the cyclicality of crude, and some of that has to come from inorganic growth, has to come from initiatives that we need to initiate as opposed to wait for customers to bring business to us.",
            "So, I think putting all that in is kind of where we're at right now is we have our eyes in the short term, but we also have a lot of specific effort on long-term.

In fact, it was part of our planned response to the significant volume drops we saw here in the quarter. When you look at the increase in dwell we have on a very low base to begin with. So, you got to take that into consideration. We're talking about adding an hour or so to the car cycle. That's measured in days and sometimes weeks when it goes offline to the railroads. And then, you look at what we were able to do with train length and train weight, all time records. Bigger trains drive greater fuel efficiency and utilization of our locomotives. And as a result, we were able to reduce crew starts 21% greater than volume reduction. Our active online inventory was reduced as much as 20% in the quarter. So, increased dwell did not drive additional cars online. Train velocity improved 5%. It\u2019s a big part of a car cycle. So, we made up time there. And then, you look at our employee productivity, it eclipsed all time highs from a service standpoint, three straight months of delivering all-time grain to the ports. And then, our domestic intermodal service really has never run better. So, we made the right calls in the quarter and we'll continue to focus in on what's important. Thanks for the question."

Loaders is basically reverse of a blank. When shipping line add loaders, that means that they are actually adding vessel in the schedule, because of the strong import. But the export is not as strong right now from North America. Do you want to look out in times for the next few months what things look like, Keith?"

            "Yes. As JJ said, the addition of these extra loaders is kind of the reverse of the blanks. And that's a positive thing for us. And then, talking to several of our customers, whether they're North American based or overseas, they've done a really good job managing their capacity, and they've done a really good job of creating a market where they've been able to keep the rates in good stead. So, there is pent up demand right now. We are kind of in a peak season I would say right now. And if the discretionary income of the people that are doing all this buying, whether it's at the home -- the DIY folks that are putting in the decks or painting, if that keeps up, and if the strong business that we've been handling, like the refrigerated goods that are happening now, whether we're in a pandemic or not that, I think that's going to continue to grow with what we brought on with TransX and H&R and our other wholesale partners that are keeping that business strong. I don't think that we're going to see -- unless there's another wave of the pandemic, I think that -- the contacts that I talked to, they're seeing it stay strong into at least in the beginning of the fourth quarter. We'll see how it goes. But that's kind of what we're planning for right now with them as they give us a heads up over the next two to three months."

            "There is a surge from the retailer, which is reflecting back in shipping line and back into the port activities into a different consumption, which is I would call it a stay at home consumption. People are building a deck, they're renovating their house, they're painting. They\u2019re spending money in their backyard. They're putting a pool. I mean, these are the things there is a high amount of disposable income that goes into it. So, some supply chain out of whack, some supply chain and warehouse is full, because people don't want to buy those stuffs. And some of the warehouse that relate to what I just said, sort of the stay at home expense around the house and on the backyard, I mean these supply chains are empty. And you try to get a barbecue, you may not quite get the kind that you're looking for. You're just going to have to buy whatever is left at Home Depot. So, we see some of that too where some container needs to move fast because of consumer is spending his money differently this summer."

            "Thank you, operator. Thanks for joining us today. Maybe I can just use some closing comments. We're very proud of our end-of-quarter results here. The team has been able to do the best of what came out as very quickly. We kept everybody safe. We unfortunately had to do quite a few layoffs. Good news is, we started we call some people back to work. We also started to get some asset back in the business. You see from our cars at RTM every week that there is some sequential growth. We would love to see more of it. But, we'll track the economy. In the meantime, Rob is working very hard on this cost, and we're lucky and staying focus on long-term business. I mentioned the work that we do on strategy and the work that we're doing with -- things related to organic growth, which have nothing to do with most of what we talked about here today.",
            "So, stay tuned. CN is ready for anything, whether we have a slow recovery or second wave of pandemic or a better business outlook sometime in October-November. So, we'll see. Thank you for joining us today. This is the end of the call. Thank you, Patrick."
