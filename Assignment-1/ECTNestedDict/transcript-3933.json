         "Thank you, Lawrie, and good morning. It gives me great pleasure to introduce results of our mineral resource update at Red Lake, which have delivered 11 million ounces of gold, grading 7.1 grams per tonne, with details summarized on Slide 16.",
         "The modernization of the resource gives Evolution an outstanding opportunity to step back and optimize a life of mine plan that fully unlocks the potential of this world-class geological address. The hard work and long hours by the team onsite, in conjunction with our expert consultants, have produced a result consistent with what we believe was possible over time. But this outcome has been delivered well ahead of any schedule we\u2019d imagined.",
         "Turning to Slide 17, which gives a breakdown of the individual numbers across the various orebody groupings at Red Lake. The most significant result comes from the upper Campbell area of the operation, from which we are reporting a new resource of 4.3 million ounces, grading 10.5 grams per tonne gold. This resource starts from surface and extends to a depth of 1,200 meters below. I will come back to upper Campbell later in the presentation.",
         "Our revision of the mineral resources commenced back in February when we decided we would completely modernize the resource model. We went back to first principles and built geological models from scratch, which included rewire framing of mineralized domains, grade estimation into the block model and thorough model validation followed by resource classification.",
         "We utilized information from 47,000 drill holes, totaling over 7 million meters of drilling, of which 85% has been drilled in the last 20 years. The drilling database is one of the largest we have ever worked with and includes just short of 6 million samples.",
         "Given the magnitude of the project we are undertaking, we engaged Toronto-based mining consulting firm, Roscoe Postle Associates, to initiate a full rebuild of the mineral resource. Over 10,000 hours have been committed to the project over a five-month period since February.",
         "The modernization exercise resulted in consolidation of 142 individual block models developed by previous owners to a more manageable 19 models. Classification of each model was completed by Evolution geologists in conjunction with RPA. We constrained the resources reported this morning by an underground mining shape optimizer that assumed a gold price of A$2,000.",
         "A conventional mechanized mining technique and parameters typical of current underground mining operations, which is consistent with Evolution\u2019s approach across all its assets of constraining resources at $2,000 an ounce and estimating reserves at A$1,450 per ounce. We have adopted a conservative approach to grade estimation by accounting for geological contact dilution between our wire frame and block model volumes.",
         "Our classification methodology has also been conservative, particularly in the Upper Campbell and Red Lake areas of the mine. A two-meter wide buffer was created around all old openings in these areas, which we have excluded from the models and are reflected in the numbers reported this morning. The two-meter buffer has not been applied to the lower areas of the mine where we have modern survey control.",
         "In the upper Campbell area of the mine, over 61% of the total volume is classified indicated resource, where the average drill spacing is six meters. 30% of the resource is classified inferred, informed by an average drill spacing of 17 meters. This leaves 9% of the resource remaining unclassified as a result of insufficient drilling to satisfy our minimum standards of geologic confidence.",
         "So how and why have we been able to identify this opportunity in a mine with a seen-year history? To understand this, I think one needs to reflect on the past, which we show on the time line in Slide 18. We find the history of the Red Lake camp incredibly fascinating.",
         "The two most important takeaways for us was the operation of two mines by separate owners producing from the same group of orebodies; the Campbell operation, which would eventually be owned and operated by Placer Dome in the 1980s, which was historically a larger producer than the adjacent Red Lake mine.",
         "And when I describe it as adjacent, I mean, it is the same mineral system containing the same orebodies that are continuous from mine to mine, but separated by tenement boundary affectionately termed the party wall. The party wall caused the blind spot initially for the operators at Campbell and eventually under the consolidated ownership of Goldcorp, where it continued as a divide of the same orebodies.",
         "We have been able to widen the field of view and identify a significant high-grade resource that daylight its surface and extends to a depth of 1,200 meters. The luxury of a long history of high-grade production from Campbell and then the high-grade zone has been a blessing and a curse for the Red Lake operation. Production of very high-grade mineralization cemented a cost profile only supportable by mining these very high grades.",
         "As well, drilling that identified mineralization with less than double-digit grades was classified subeconomic. This is the unexpected opportunity we have surfaced in modernizing the resource base. It is also fair to reflect on the fact that the gold price we are assuming today is models higher than that in the early 2000s.",
         "The next set of slides will illustrate what we have uncovered in the upper Campbell area of the mine. Slide 19 shows the Red Lake operation with the underlying mineralization and mine workings projected to surface. Cochenour is situated in the west, left at the airport. Campbell and Red Lake are situated on the right, the old party wall that separated historic ownership of the mines is also highlighted.",
         "Turning to Slide 20, we\u2019re going to look at a window through the upper Campbell side of the party wall sliced at the 9,510 level, which is 150 meters below surface. This view is cut from a 100-meter vertical section through the upper Campbell mine, and illustrates how grade control was done in the past, which \u2013 with each of the colored points representing an individual underground site sample.",
         "Stopes and development drives are highlighted by the blue gray s-build shapes. Referring to the legend on the top left, it is evident that incredibly high grades were mined from narrow structures now represented by mining voids in the gray panel shapes. This type of ore control sampling historically substituted for more expensive grade control drilling.",
         "Drilling eventually caught up with mining, which you can see by turning to Slide 21. Here, the results have clearly delineated new areas of mineralization that lie outside of and beyond the mined out high-grade shared zones.",
         "Interestingly, the mineralized volume in the center and to the left of the party wall that is on the old Placer side, has been delineated by very close-based drilling, giving us high confidence in the geological continuity of mineralization.",
         "However, grades in the drilling results are lower than those historically mined. Our onsite inquiry suggest that this was an area that has been largely overlooked because of the luxury of the very high grades that were being produced from the high grade zone.",
         "Slide 22 is a slice of our new block model with estimated block grades filtered above three grams per tonne gold. Block model grades are informed by historic drilling outside of and excluding previous production.",
         "Slide 23 shows outlines generated by the mining shape optimizer from which we can strand and report resources for inferred or better grade blocks that are above a cutoff grade of 3.4 grams per tonne. We have applied the same methodology to the lower Campbell, upper and lower Red Lake and Cochenour bodies, resulting in similar resource uplifts as we have seen at upper Campbell.",
         "I believe the opportunity for us at Red Lake is a great example of where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. We\u2019ve been able to bring a different lens and approach to the mineral resource solution. For the first time, the mineral resources have been evaluated under a rationalized geological framework and by applying a wider range of cutoff grades than considered by previous owners.",
         "With that, operator, I\u2019ll open the line to questions."

      "Jacob Klein": [
         "Thank you for joining us today on this very important Evolution FY 2020 Results Call and Business Update. This morning, on the call, I\u2019m joined by Lawrie Conway, Finance Director and CFO; and Glen Masterman, VP, Discovery and Business Development.",
         "As you have seen in the announcement we made on the ASX yesterday, forest fires have been burning around the Red Lake community and the area has been evacuated on Tuesday evening. The safety of our people is our highest priority, and I\u2019m pleased that all of our employees and contractors are safe. The operation has been temporarily suspended, but we did not expect this event to have a material impact on Red Lake\u2019s September quarter production.",
         "At Evolution, we have made a strategic decision to operate in the Tier 1 mining-friendly jurisdictions of Australia and Canada, and we are fortunate that the COVID-19 pandemic is being well-managed in both of these countries. Evolution\u2019s management of the COVID-19 pandemic has also been very successful so far. To date, we have not had any material impact on our production due to COVID 19.",
         "Our safety performance is improving. Performance in this area can never be good enough, but the signs are encouraging. Our culture of engaging, reporting and learning from every incident is also improving markedly.",
         "I\u2019m pleased to report that in the last MSCI ESG report issued two weeks ago, Evolution had its rating confirmed that, a, being upgraded from BBB in the last 12 months; and we were placed in the top five industry leaders in the areas of health and safety and business ethics.",
         "Community support and our social license to operate amongst our most valuable assets. Beyond the many positive interactions and contributions our people make as Evolution employees and, in the majority of cases, as members of the communities near our operations, we measure our social license through a stakeholder perception survey completed by Deloitte every two years.",
         "I\u2019m pleased to say that our latest results showed our overall social license to operate score has risen from 4.06 out of 5 in 2018 to 4.21 in 2020, with all Evolution operations falling within the high approval category.",
         "At Cowal, we are on track to submit the regulatory development application to the New South Wales government for the underground mine early in the December quarter. We expect up to 300 jobs will be created in the Central West of New South Wales near West Wyalong during the construction phase and up to 100 new long-term jobs will be created for the life of the underground mine.",
         "Turning to the FY 2020 financial results. It is very pleasing to be reporting record statutory and underlying net profit after tax and record cash flow. Yes, we have had the tailwind of a higher gold price. But as these results reflect, we have consistently delivered our strategy of upgrading the quality of our asset portfolio and have built a sustainable, high-margin, long-term business.",
         "Group free cash flow for the last 12 months, after investing significant capital to enhance our future, was $542 million. As a point of comparison, five years ago, in FY 2015, our mine operating cash flow was $306 million versus $1.1 billion in the last 12 months.",
         "Our net mine cash flow five years ago was $138 million. In FY 2020, it was $736 million. This is a fivefold increase as compared to the Australian dollar gold price rising 52% in the same period.",
         "We believe our shareholders should directly benefit from this journey. That is why I\u2019m particularly pleased that the Board has declared our 15th consecutive dividend of $0.09 per share fully franked. This brings total dividends for the last 12 months to $0.16 per share, an increase of almost 70%. Cumulatively, once this final dividend is paid, we will have rewarded shareholders with $732 million in dividends.",
         "But we understand that the market is forward-looking. These results are history and I now want to shift gears and talk about our future. Using the terminology and concept made famous by the legendary investor, Warren Buffett, during these good times, we need to build out and widen our economic moat. At Evolution, we are doing this by continually focusing on improving the quality of our portfolio by extending mine life without compromising margins.",
         "Through our strategy of concentrating our business on a small number of high-quality assets, we have now grown our mineral resource inventory to 30 million gold equivalent ounces.",
         "Over the next three years, the outlook we have provided today is one of an increasing production profile at reducing costs. The cost outlook means, we will remain one of the highest-margin, lowest-cost gold producers in the world.",
         "The growth is all coming from near-term organic opportunities already in our portfolio. Importantly, it is mostly being driven by our long-life assets in Cowal and Red Lake. And if we look beyond the three-year outlook horizon, we can see even more upside and growth at these important cornerstone assets.",
         "This three-year outlook includes what I have described as our initial investment case at Red Lake, a 3-year transformation plan to deliver a sustainable 200,000 ounces per annum at an all-in sustaining cost of less than US$1,000 an ounce. This base case will deliver appropriate returns to our shareholders and is what motivated us to make the investments and acquire the asset.",
         "As we described in our June quarterly report issued three weeks ago, we are pleased with the progress we are making, are well on track and confident that this initial investment case is deliverable.",
         "However, what the three-year outlook does not capture is what I believe to be the most transformative value-creating opportunity in the history of Evolution. That is the 11 million ounce JORC-compliant resource that we have announced today at Red Lake.",
         "As a reference, the last mineral resource issued publicly for the operation estimated the resource inventory to be 2.9 million ounces. This new resource estimate does not trigger any of the contingent payment consideration to new mines. Let me hastily add that the contingent payments are ones I\u2019ll be very happy to make as it will mean that we have been successful and discovered even more ounces at this exciting property.",
         "Red Lake can best be described as applying a different lens to an opportunity and emerging with a completely different, and I add much better results. To date, Red Lake\u2019s history has been viewed and structured as a narrow vein, very high-grade underground mine.",
         "The site geologists tell us that generally, anything less than 3 to 4 grams per tonne was considered waste and often not sampled in the drilling. And until recently, only material about 15 grams per tonne was considered for inclusion in the mine plan.",
         "That strategy and approach worked well for long periods in the mine\u2019s history, particularly from the early 2,000 to 2016, when the famous high-grade zone was mined, an incredible 7 million ounce orebody grading 50 to 60 grams per tonne with a footprint of only 200 meters by 200 meters and extending over 1 kilometer down plunge.",
         "During this phase, there wasn\u2019t a strong need to think differently as this orebody propelled Goldcorp to be one of the most highly valued gold companies in the world. For the last four to five years, as the high-grade zone was depleting, operating at Red Lake has been tough. The cost base was too high and was suited to the Bonanza-style grades.",
         "The mine consistently missed its forecasts as its corporate strategy of trying to increase production, reduce costs and minimize investments collided with a site situation that required a reset of expectations, investment in underground development and exploration, and most importantly, a rethink of what the future could look like if the operating model was changed.",
         "Again, as a point of reference and a different perspective, it\u2019s worth noting that a head grade of 7 to 8 grams per tonne, this mine, Red Lake, will be the highest-grade mine within Evolution\u2019s portfolio. Being the new owner, we have had the opportunity to undertake a major reset.",
         "Firstly, we have tackled some of the things that were considered obstacles in the past. We have reduced the workforce by 20%. We are optimizing the plants, rationalizing the equipment, simplifying the planning and mining fronts, and most critically, have a motivated workforce up for the challenge of change.",
         "We are five months into a three-year process, but we are well on our way. Now with an 11 million ounce mineral resource and lots of exploration upside yet to be tested, we have an opportunity, really, the luxury to completely rethink the future of this mine and consider what is possible.",
         "The mineral inventory is only the first step in reimagining the future of Red Lake. We expect a step-change in our reserve base, and work has commenced on optimizing this into a new life-of-mine plan with a view that we will be able to be ready to declare a reserve update in our 2020 MROR statement.",
         "At our Investor Day on the 1st of September, we are looking forward to articulating some of the exciting upside opportunities we plan to investigate as to how this materially larger resource base could deliver a completely different future for Red Lake.",
         "Our portfolio now has a resource base of 30 million gold equivalent ounces. All of these resources are economically constrained at a A$2,000 per ounce gold price. At today\u2019s gold price, this resource base is equivalent to over A$80 billion of in-ground revenue.",
         "Our job going forward is to continue to grow our resources and bring the maximum of this in-ground value to account, converting it safely, efficiently and responsibly into cash in our bank accounts, and then ultimately, into yours as a shareholder of Evolution.",
         "With that, I will hand over to Lawrie."

      "Lawrie Conway": [
         "Thank you, Jake, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to be presenting the FY 2020 financial results, as well as our guidance for FY 2021 and three-year outlook to FY 2023.",
         "Turning to Slide 7, which outlines the financial highlights for the year. The results really reflect a very good year for the company with all metrics improving on the previous year and a number of records being set.",
         "In a profit sense, our statutory and underlying profit were both records at $302 million and $405 million, respectively. The main difference between the statutory and underlying profit was an impairment of the Mt Carlton asset, which involved a non-cash write-down of $101 million post tax. While it is a non-cash item, this outcome is a disappointing one. Fortunately, though, this is the only real negative in the financials.",
         "I\u2019ll go through the drivers to our improved profit performance on the next slide. The cash generation of the business continues to reflect the quality of the portfolio that we have established over the past few years. Our operating cash profit and cash flow were up by about 40% to 45%, while group cash flow was up 86% to $542 million.",
         "Reflecting the increase in underlying profit, our underlying earnings per share were up 84% to around $0.24 per share. On the back of these exceptional financial results and cash generation, we have increased our final dividend by 50% to $0.09 per share fully franked. While our policy is based on cash flow, this dividend also represents two-thirds of our underlying profit.",
         "Moving to Slide 8 and the drivers to our profit. Our underlying profit of $405 million was up 86%, driven by higher revenue, that was up 29%, which was the same price, same increase as our achieved gold price. Our royalties were up by 20% to a total of $76 million. The standout in our profit result was that we effectively maintained our operating costs flat with just over 1% increase.",
         "Considering that labor comprises approximately 45% of our cost base, and this increased by 4% over the year, we had additional costs, such as the full-year of Total\u2019s leach at Cowal and commencement of the Mt Carlton underground, the savings in other costs have enabled us to maintain a low-cost position. Red Lake delivered over $15 million in the first quarter, while at Cowal and Mt Rawdon, planned drawdowns of stockpiles added a non-cash charge of $49 million to costs.",
         "Turning to Slide 9, which really demonstrates that our low-cost position is translating to real cash generation. The cash operating margin, or EBITDA margin, for the group increased by 10% to 53%.",
         "As the charts on the right demonstrates, our assets are individually contributing to this outcome. Red Lake delivered well in its first quarter at a 37% EBITDA margin. And over time, we expect to see this achieve the levels of our high-margin long-life assets, Cowal and Ernest Henry. They delivered margins of 60% and 69%, respectively. Pleasingly, Mungari and Mt Rawdon also delivered improved results.",
         "A critical component to managing our capital allocation is that assets need to fund their own investment requirements. With the exception of Mt Carlton, all assets delivered positive and record cash flows during the year. It also should recognize the reliability being achieved by the Mungari team as the reward for effort was over $113 million of net cash flow delivered for the year.",
         "On Slide 10, we have our group cash flow. This is essentially the net cash we are generating to fund acquisitions, service debt and pay dividends. We generated over $542 million, which continues our sustained high cash generation. It means, we are putting cash in the bank. Importantly, it is being done at a very high margin.",
         "As shown in the chart on the top right, which breaks down our cash flow on a per ounce produced basis. Every ounce produced delivered $726 into the bank. This is a net margin of 32% and an increase of 88% over last year, which is significant since we only achieved a 29% increase in our achieved gold price. We have maintained our discipline on debt and the balance sheet is solid.",
         "On closing the Red Lake acquisition, our gearing went to 14% and we have now halved this to a very manageable 7%. The good news for our business and shareholders is that this was all delivered at a gold price, which is A$400 below the current spot price.",
         "Moving to Slide 11. Given the strength of the balance sheet and record cash generation, we have declared a final dividend of $0.09 per share. This dividend will be fully franked and paid on the 25th of September. The dividend is based on our policy of targeting a payout ratio of 50% of group cash flow. This brings the full-year dividend up to $0.16 per share fully franked, which is up 68% on last year. It equates to $365 per ounce produced, which is an excellent return for our shareholders as is the yield at just under 3%.",
         "I\u2019ll now move to our guidance for FY 2021 and the outlook for the next three years. On Slide 12 is our production and cost guidance for FY 2021. We are guiding production of 670,000 to 730,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,240 to $1,300 per ounce. The main drivers to the production include Cowal, which will be lowered due to the processing of low-grade stockpiles until the end of the year when Stage H ore becomes available.",
         "We will see Red Lake increase on an annualized basis from the June 2020 quarter to 125,000 to 135,000 ounces. At the other sites, there will be some declines and some increases, but overall, there will be no material net change.",
         "On costs, Red Lake will initially add $200 to $215 an per ounce to our AISC and then trend down as the cost benefits and higher production from the transformation program are realized. We\u2019re not expecting any material increase in operating costs through the year. As we see recently negotiated savings on input costs, negating any increase in labor or other costs. Lower copper production will add $30 to $35 per ounce to our AISC.",
         "A point of note is our guidance and outlook is based on a gold price of A$2,200 per ounce and A$8,400 per tonne of copper. This impacts our AISC through royalties and byproduct credits.",
         "Turning to Slide 13 and capital guidance. We are guiding sustaining capital to be approximately $113 million to $138 million and major capital to be $260 million to $290 million. The only thing of note in sustaining capital is at Red Lake, where the ramp-up is due to the transformation program, which will see us invest $55 million to $60 million this year. The main items of this investment are shown on the slide.",
         "In terms of major capital, the investment is predominantly at Cowal, Red Lake and Mungari. These investments are either for continuation of previously approved projects such as Stage H and the IWL at Cowal, or the advancement of growth projects, such as the underground feasibility study at Cowal, mine development at Red Lake to rebuild ore stocks for increased production and the mine development at \u2013 of satellite pits at Mungari.",
         "Moving to our outlook to FY 2023 on Slide 14. Production is planned to increase to over 800,000 ounces by FY 2023, while the AISC will decline over this period to $1,125 to $1,185 per ounce. Production growth will be driven by the commencement of the Cowal underground planned to the end of FY 2022 and the successful completion of the transformation plan at Red Lake.",
         "Meanwhile, we now expect Mungari to be able to achieve 110,000 to 120,000 ounces over an extended period through satellite pits, regional resources and the improved plant throughput rates.",
         "As mentioned earlier, the main driver to the higher AISC in the next couple of years will be the lower-grade material process at Cowal until Stage H or an underground higher-grade ore becomes available and the lower cost and higher cost \u2013 higher production at Red Lake is delivered in FY 2023. Again, we do not expect to see any significant cost inflation across the portfolio in the next few years.",
         "Lastly, the capital outlook on Slide 15. Sustaining capital is expected to range between $95 million and $138 million, with no significant projects outside of those mentioned for Red Lake in FY 2021. Major capital investment is based around our significant growth projects at Cowal and Red Lake, which will materially increase production for the long-term and further add to the quality of the portfolio.",
         "Investment at Cowal is focused on increasing production above 300,000 ounces per annum through development of a new underground mine with between $100 million and $130 million to be invested annually over FY 2022 and FY 2023.",
         "At Red Lake, we continue to invest in mine development with between $70 million and $85 million planned for the next three years to enable production to increase in excess of 200,000 ounces.",
         "Prior to handing over to Glen, I want to take the opportunity to thank all the Evolution team who\u2019ve put a lot of time and effort in over the last month or so in compiling the full-year financial results, the FY 2021 guidance and three-year outlook. We really do appreciate their considerable contribution.",
         "With that, thank you for your time, and I hand over to Glen."

            "Thanks very much. Good morning, Jake, and thanks for the update and the outlook today. If I can, I\u2019ll start with a couple of questions on Red Lake, since Glen was talking about it so enthusiastically. Great to see the growth in the resource base. As you\u2019ve highlighted, that\u2019s clearly been delivered by a rethinking of the economic cutoff grade.",
            "Firstly, can you give us an indication of how we might think that this might convert to a reserve grade? Should we continue to expect a reserve grade, which is a couple of grams a tonne lower than the current resource grade after accounting for mining widths and dilution?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Matthew Frydman"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, Matthew. Look, I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s early days in the optimization, I guess, program for the reserve. But look, I think, the resource model has already baked in some conservatism around the dilution.",
            "So, as I mentioned earlier there, we have included dilution, which exists between the wire framing and the block model. And we\u2019ve also included dilution around the historic workings, particularly in the upper areas of the mine. And so this \u2013 just as an example, the dilution between wire frames and the block model volumes really accounts for 5 million additional tonnes into the model that have been sort of accounted for at zero grade.",
            "So we feel that the resource model is reporting grades that are already fairly conservative. The reserve grade is obviously going to be estimated at a higher cutoff grade, which will drive the average grade of the reserves higher. And by the time we bake in the mining dilution and recoveries, we would hope to be able to deliver a reserve at around about the same average grade as the resource reported this morning."

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Thanks, Glen. That\u2019s very helpful detail there. So I guess, following on from that, as you described, you\u2019ve got some very favorable resource grades there in upper Campbell. So wondering if conceptually, there\u2019s an opportunity there for mine sequencing to retain something closer to, I guess, current head grade.",
            "You note that upper Campbell starts at surface. Is there open optionality there? And would that help you balance the need for multiple working faces in the mine to have a productive operation, while also maintaining some elevated or some higher head grades?"

What options are you exploring there in the revised mine plan, I guess, firstly to achieve your \u2013 in excess of 200,000 ounces per annum target?

You\u2019ve provided quite a useful breakdown there on the majority of the projects.",

Look, I think there\u2019s \u2013 from our recollection in FY 2022, the main capital will be finishing off the integrated waste landform in the underground at Cowal, which those two projects together at the top end will give you about $210 million of that major capital, which is $250 million to $280 million. You then got a $35 million of mine development at Red Lake, and then some satellite pits at Mungari.",
            "So when you take the midpoint of those, that almost covers all of the major capital for FY 2022, because there\u2019s not a lot else going on certainly at Ernest Henry at Mt Rawdon and Mt Carlton. So we don\u2019t see much else in that year.",
            "In year three, we certainly will see \u2013 in FY 2023, we\u2019ve got the satellite pit at Mungari of 10 to 15. We\u2019ve also got some capital earmarked probably about $30 million or $40 million for regional resources at Mungari, but nothing \u2013 no specific projects locked in on those. It\u2019s work that we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ll be doing studies through 2021 and 2022. So that will be one of your gap closes in FY 2023.",
            "But when you look at the balance of the 10 to 15 at the satellite pits at Mungari, up to $20 million at Red Lake continued mine development and then finishing the underground at Cowal at $100 million to $125 million. So really, that would be the only thing that would be different in the major capital would be some work at Mungari. Again, because Ernest Henry and Mt Carlton and Mt Rawdon, we don\u2019t see a lot of major capital going on in those assets."

As well as incremental to that, there was 5 million ounces of future resource. And our, I guess, acquisition case was built around on the conversion of areas of that 5 million ounces.",

Should I read that as executing on that 200,000 ounce per annum level from Red Lake during FY 2023? I know you previously kind of talked about needing that three years to turn that around.

That basically, by FY 2023 where we\u2019ve completed a lot of that transformation and we\u2019re at that process \u2013 our production rate."

But it is lower production next year.",

Now you\u2019re trying to offset that through increased processing rates. So we\u2019re looking to sustain that at 2 million tonnes per annum. But if you look in FY 2020 versus 2021, we almost had a half a year where we were at that 1.2 million.",

Assuming that really focuses around that upper Campbell zone and party wall. But from what I can see, there\u2019s a pretty substantial amount of surface infrastructure there. So I guess, the question is, do you think that the potential open pit opportunity could be big enough to justify basically a complete recut of the operation?"

Look, I think \u2013 look, as I mentioned, there\u2019s a number of levers that we\u2019re really only just starting to investigate now, and the pit concept is just one of them. I think, as you say, there\u2019s infrastructure in the vicinity of that upper Campbell mineralization and across the other side in the Red Lake.",

But I think, like I said, it\u2019s just very early days in how we go about optimizing this resource and what the best solution will be in terms of driving value and what\u2019s going to be best for the business."

If you\u2019re talking about an open pit, you\u2019re talking about a new mill at much different throughput rates.
