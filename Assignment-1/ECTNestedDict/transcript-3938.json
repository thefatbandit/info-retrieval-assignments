         "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to the RealPage financial results conference call for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020. With me on the call today are Steve Winn, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Ernst, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Brian Shelton, our Chief Accounting Officer.",

      "Steve Winn": [
         "Thanks, Rhett. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Second quarter financial performance was quite a bit better than expected, with total revenue growing 17% to $286 million and adjusted EBITDA also growing 17% to nearly $80 million, both compared to last year. Numbers were exceptionally good relative to guidance because the impact of COVID-19 was not as impactful as we had feared and there is surging demand for solutions that facilitate virtual leasing and living offered by RealPage.",
         "Today, I\u2019ll discuss our perspective of the macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 on our industry and how we see RealPage performing in that backdrop. I\u2019ll also review the strengths of our strategic platform with special emphasis on our virtual leasing and living solutions that have become immensely more important with so many residents working and living at home. Finally, I\u2019ll provide an update on our progress penetrating the large SMB segment of the rental housing market, a market that we really like.",
         "First, the apartment industry backdrop. Leasing activity that plunged in March through May has now come back to much healthier levels. The number of leases executed in June and July topped year ago volumes in most locations. In turn, occupancy is still in solid shape at just over 95% for the country as a whole. Following the same pattern seen in leasing volume, pricing took a big hit in late Q1 and early Q2 but now appears to be stabilizing. We can look at the rents recorded in signed new leases tracked in either our property management or revenue management software. Those numbers give a much more accurate view of what\u2019s happening in the market compared to merely looking at rents reported by Internet listing services or other sources. Those executed rents show U.S. pricing is back to the level seen a year ago. That\u2019s after rents plunged as much as 7% or so year-over-year in the early days of the second quarter.",
         "Renewal lease price changes also are hovering near zero right now since protection of occupancy is such a high priority for most owners. Completions in the first half of 2020 came in at 154,000 units, and about the same number are slated to finish in the last half of this year. Total ongoing construction tops 600,000 market rate units. So new supply is expected to continue to pour into the market in 2021, even though new starts are coming to a halt. We expect that our clients with new product will need lots of help getting those additions through initial lease-up. Resident relations and renter retention will get lots of attention as existing top-tier projects that have to compete with all this new supply come online.",
         "Scheduled completions top the demand volume that RealPage economics \u2013 economists anticipate over the next few months. We\u2019re expecting that U.S. apartment occupancy will trail off another 100 basis points or so through early 2021, dipping to around 94%. Like upwise, we\u2019re forecasting that rents will begin to drop again once we hit the seasonally slow leasing period that comes in the cold winter months.",
         "As always, there\u2019s some variation in expected performance from one location to another. Anticipated results tend to be better for markets in the Sun Belt and the Midwest than in gateway metros in the Northeast and along the West Coast. Likewise, suburban properties should do better than their urban core counterparts.",
         "An important premise underlying our macroeconomic prediction is some level of federal support for those who have lost their jobs, keeping unemployment benefits above the levels offered by individual states. These enhanced unemployment benefits have kept rent payments at professionally managed properties close to normal levels. Both sides of the aisle support a continuation of the unemployment stimulus but are debating on how much. While we expect the market can absorb some reduction in supplemental unemployment incentives, we would encourage Congress to reduce the stimulus in steps that can be more easily absorbed. A large decrease in unemployment stimulus may trigger a corresponding decrease in rent collections, which we do believe would have a negative ripple effect on the economy.",
         "Next, I\u2019ll discuss our virtual leasing and living vision for the future. COVID-19 has impacted how we think apartments are going to function in the future. We are maintaining our level of investment in product development in order to accelerate enhanced functionality that enables apartment operators to lease apartments more efficiently without leasing agents having to be physically present in the office. We believe we can eliminate most on-site work so that a fewer number of leasing agents can work from home and be more effective than they were pre-COVID.",
         "One example of our investment in virtual leasing is a new AI chatbot that we announced last quarter, and that has since been adopted on thousands of units to reduce the time that agents must spend on the phone. AI in this case stands for augmented intelligence, which means that the bot handles most chats with very sophisticated interactive responses to almost any question, but the bot also incorporates true AI technology to learn and adjust its responses, which we believe distinguishes from \u2013 it from others on the market today.",
         "Of course, the prospect can always connect to a live agent in our contact center, and this transfer is warm, meaning no delays. When our agent does come into the call, they are given context because in the background, we have been building an expanded guest card so that the prospect doesn\u2019t have to start all over, which we all know can be a frustrating experience. Our data shows that a chatbot like ours supplemented with live agents and a warm transfer converts significantly higher than competitive chat services on the market today. A side benefit of the AI chatbot is the price operators pay for chat is dropping 30% compared to live agent chats alone.",
         "We are also testing an AI voicebot now and expect to release this later in the year. We expect this will allow our contact center, supplement it with augmented intelligence to convert much better than competing voicebots on the market today. Both our AI chatbot and AI voicebots are tightly integrated with our CRM, so appointments can be set and integrated immediately for leasing agents to take over.",
         "RealPage is already providing technology that enables online tours by leasing agents that are working from home. We are investing heavily to improve this experience and increase conversion percentage well above what is possible from leasing agents in the office. Candidly, we believe virtual leasing is going to get better than in-house or in-office leasing and can be executed at a much lower cost to operators. We will be showcasing many new virtual leasing tools at our Virtual Real World User Conference on September 14 and 15.",
         "There was already a trend in our industry to move more and more work off-site and reduce dependency on-site staff. In the past, residents would drop off their rent checks at the leasing office. When the pandemic hit, there was no one in the leasing office, so residents had to go online. Earlier in the quarter, we announced lockbox processing for our clients so they can eliminate the need to scan paper checks in the office, and more important, someone in the office is not needed to feed paper checks through a scanner. We adopted these capabilities from our ClickPay team and applied it across all payment processing platforms at RealPage. We\u2019re the only payment processor in the market today that can offer a truly paymentless platform for on-site personnel.",
         "Earlier in the week, we also introduced a new online vendor payments product to eliminate the need for any vendor checks to be written in the office. While virtual leasing is extremely important to us, we believe the industry\u2019s greatest opportunity to generate incremental yield comes from online virtual living. Usage of our resident portals was way up in Q2 as residents demanded in their apartments for some of the same conveniences that they enjoyed at work. We helped literally millions of residents migrate to virtual living in a matter of a few weeks.",
         "Most owners monetize less than 5% of their total revenue from amenities. The rest is base rent. Rent controls are becoming more prevalent around the country, and it is apparent that owners will struggle to raise base rents in this new environment of high unemployment and greater governmental restrictions on rent increases. Residents want more conveniences at the place of living because they\u2019re spending more time there. We believe that our industry can unlock significant incremental yield simply by offering residents something that they already want to buy. Monetization of amenities is an area of significant investment by RealPage, and we expect to roll out technology that makes this possible. Again, we invite you to attend our Real World Virtual User Conference on September 14 and 15 to learn more about this opportunity.",
         "Finally, I\u2019d like to give an update on our SMB strategy and the success we\u2019re achieving here. As you will recall, this category includes smaller multifamily, single-family association and vacation rental operators. During the second quarter of 2020, the SMB category represented nearly $424 million of ACV, 9 million units and an ARPU of over $47. This represents year-over-year growth of 35%, 26% and 7%, respectively.",
         "It is important to note that not only is our unit presence growing, but we are also having great success cross-selling additional RealPage solutions into the SMB category. This is validated by the fact that while units grew significantly driven in large parts by Buildium, overall ARPU levels also actually grew year-over-year, highlighting our success in selling additional products into our installed base.",
         "From a technical perspective, our building integration efforts are proceeding well. SimpleBills integration was completed in June, and we\u2019re currently in the pilot phase of this rollout with a broader rollout to the rest of the Buildium base in September. Other integrations to RealPage products and services are progressing nicely, but we\u2019re most excited about our open API architecture that is under development and we expect to start testing later in the year. This API essentially makes Buildium open to third-party applications that desire to integrate with Buildium. Both Yardi and Breeze and AppFolio, which we compete with in this segment, are closed platforms, which we believe stifles industry innovation. At RealPage, we believe platform should be open so that innovation from third parties can complement and expand the overall value of the Buildium platform.",
         "I\u2019m very excited with the progress we\u2019re making and continue to believe our SMB strategy represents a tremendous opportunity to drive organic revenue traction over the long term.",
         "Thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call. As you know, Tom Ernst will be transitioning out of RealPage over the next few weeks. So this will be his last earnings call. We want to thank him for helping us pivot our business for expected growth well above $1 billion in revenue. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom."
      ],
      "Tom Ernst": [
         "Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve highlighted, RealPage responded at a very high level to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic in Q1 and Q2. Our team built the RealPage ship long before the pandemic to excel and is navigating it skillfully. We believe RealPage has a powerful reinvigorated organic innovation engine, and the ship is charted on a course for long-term market leadership and growth in revenue and margin despite the rough COVID-19 season.",
         "Second quarter financial performance reflects this strong growth and reflects strong RealPage positioning and the response of its team. Total revenue grew 17% year-over-year, which included 9% growth on an organic basis. We exceeded the high end of our revenue and EBITDA guidance range by $6 million and $10 million, respectively, and we are raising the midpoint of our full year outlook by $10 million and 50 basis points, respectively, to reflect our confidence in higher growth in margins.",
         "Our earnings and cash flow performance were strong. Adjusted EBITDA grew 17% year-over-year to $80 million. We generated nearly $75 million of operating cash, net of changes in customer deposits. This represents a record performance for both metrics.",
         "Total RealPage ACV growth was 19% compared to the prior year, consisting of 14% new unit growth and 5% ARPU growth. We ended the quarter with almost 19 million units consisting of nearly 10 million multifamily units from owners and managers with over 5,000 units and over 9 million SMB units.",
         "Total bookings production experienced a strong start to the year but decelerated significantly in March through May. By the end of June, 2020 bookings were ahead of last year and are accelerating. And we\u2019re seeing solid sales across all product lines, especially solutions that enable more virtual leasing and living.",
         "Total sales team members at the end of the quarter were 625, reflecting 28% growth compared to the prior year quarter. We expect to invest modestly here under the current climate and continue to focus on productivity.",
         "From a revenue growth perspective, product family growth performance was led by payments, Buildium, Renters Insurance, RealPage Utility Management, Modern Message, IMS and our revenue management platform.",
         "From a profitability perspective, adjusted EBITDA margins were flat compared to the prior year period. Margin performance was driven by continued investments for growth and included incremental expense related to RealPage adapting to the COVID-19 environment. Despite these incremental costs, we were able to ramp down some COVID-19 costs faster than anticipated. In addition, we continue to experience productivity gains from our focus over the last year on simplification, and we also received some uplift from COVID reduced \u2013 correction, from reduced COVID-19-related costs, such as travel and employee and medical benefits as many procedures were restricted.",
         "Looking at the drivers in more detail. Product development cost as a percentage of revenue decreased 40 basis points year-over-year and continues to be driven primarily by our efficiency initiatives implemented in early 2019 that would enable us to allocate resources towards innovation projects while optimizing maintenance projects.",
         "Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue decreased 110 basis points year-over-year and was driven primarily by more efficient marketing spend and decreases in travel. We still see opportunity to increase the size of our sales force in order to reach more institutional and SMB prospects. We are also pleased with results we are getting from increased virtual selling webcasts, solution expert webinars and virtual client business reviews delivered by our account managers.",
         "General administrative costs as a percentage of revenue increased 190 basis points year-over-year and was driven primarily by incremental acquisition-related costs as well as infrastructure and personnel investments to drive efficiency and scale over the long term. These costs are expected to decline by the end of the year, creating strong G&A leverage as we exit 2020 and move into 2021.",
         "During the quarter, we generated nearly $75 million of operating cash, excluding the impact from changes in restricted cash relating to accounting treatment changes. We raised $632 million in proceeds, net of fees, and capped call instruments in our May concurrent offering of $300 million in 1.5 point convertible debt and $300 million of common equity, each with an exercise greenshoe over-allotment for a combined $90 million in additional proceeds.",
         "The convertible debt is callable after three years and has an initial conversion price of $76.70 per share. RealPage simultaneously entered into capped call transactions to raise the effective conversion price to $118 per share. RealPage used $230 million of the proceeds to fully reset its $600 million revolver, and the remainder is currently retained on the cash as cash on the balance sheet, which, excluding the impact from changes in restricted cash relating to accounting treatment changes, now sits at $639 million.",
         "Our leverage ratio is now 2.3x. As we anticipated, this is towards the low end of our target 2.0 to 4.0 range that we believe is operationally optimal. On a run rate EBITDA basis, based on 2Q results, the leverage ratio would be 1.7x. Thus, as we look forward, we believe RealPage is very well positioned with a strong balance sheet to execute on our growth strategy and what we continue to see as a market that may allow for more opportunities to deploy the capital.",
         "Before I turn to guidance, I\u2019d like to frame the scenarios we contemplated in establishing the high end of our range we assume that we\u2019ll see over the remainder of the third quarter and year: a continued ramp-up and return-to-work levels, leasing activity levels and our customers\u2019 willingness to engage in new projects. In addition, the high end assumes that we\u2019ll see meaningfully \u2013 meaningful unemployment stimulus signed into law in August. At the low end of our range, we assume lower or no unemployment stimulus, resulting in substantial downward pressure on rent collection and slower work recovery from the pandemic.",
         "Now turning to guidance. For the full year, we are increasing our outlook for non-GAAP revenue to $1,135 million to $1,155 million, representing 15% to 17% total growth, including 7% to 9% organic growth. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $300 million to $308 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26% to 27%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $1.77 to $1.84.",
         "For the third quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue of $288 million to $294 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 13% to 15%, including 5% to 7% organic growth. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $74 million to $78 million, which represents margins of 26% to 27%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.43 to $0.46.",
         "On a personal note, given this is my last earnings call as CFO of RealPage, I\u2019d like to publicly thank all RealPagers for the great experience that working with you has been. I\u2019m very proud of your fierce commitment to supporting our customers. And I\u2019m proud of your energy and zeal around our North Star of innovation and simplification. You are the right team, and RealPage is the right ship to lead our industry into the future.",
         "I\u2019d also like to thank you, our RealPage shareholders, for your support. It\u2019s been a pleasure to serve as your RealPage CFO.",
         "This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let\u2019s open the call for questions."

G&A is an opportunity, and we clearly believe there\u2019s a significant opportunity to become more productive in the cost of sales. We think we can reach that target in the next couple of years, certainly on a run rate basis, without much change to the expense-to-revenue ratio on product development and sales and marketing, which we do want to continue to aggressively fund in order to continue the march towards higher and higher revenue levels."

As we think about those long-term plans, and we\u2019ve talked about $1.5 billion run rate target and $500 million in EBITDA target to exit 2020 that, that would imply something on the order of a 30% EBITDA margin as a midterm target for us. So that\u2019s \u2013 that type of a balanced approach on striving for organic growth and innovation, along with delivering margin expansion is something we remain focused on. Obviously, 2020 is a bit more about for us operating through COVID and making sure we\u2019re delivering for customers and delivering that balance, but we are focused on growth and margin expansion as we think about the future."

If we think about property manager budgets and the budgeting process, and there is a little bit of uncertainty in last especially with the decision on stimulus for the second half, but with some improvement in leasing activity and other trends, have you seen any signs that maybe some customers might be wanting to turn any projects on that they\u2019ve previously delayed or, I guess, what do you think of that?"

So it\u2019s an encouraging trajectory over the quarter. I think as Steve highlighted in his prepared remarks, there\u2019s still quite a bit of uncertainty in the market as we think about how that momentum continues, but the signs during the second quarter were definitely encouraging towards readiness to do more new projects with RealPage."

In terms of the virtual leasing solutions that you kind of highlight that are in high demand, can you give us a sense of what percentage of the business that represents today? And are all those based on internally developed technology or is there any third-party license technology that is embedded in it?"

            "Leasing is primarily internal development, but we do obviously rely on the core AI engines from other parties. The big change here is, can we deliver a better experience at least 16 hours a day to a prospect that wants to tour a property if they visit it virtually versus in-person. And we believe vehemently that we can. And that is the thrust of a lot of the development that\u2019s underway.",

In fact, what\u2019s going to happen is they\u2019ll get repurposed to become virtual leasing agents working out of their apartment. They don\u2019t actually have to come to the leasing office in order to do their job. But there\u2019ll probably be fewer of them, and they\u2019ll be utilized much more efficiently because they\u2019ll be able to manage more than one property."

The AI chatbot has actually been helpful because we would have had a hard time staffing up to handle everything without AI chat. It\u2019s also helpful to the clients because the cost of AI supplemental contact center is less, it\u2019s lower. We actually see the contact center revenue going down in the future. But because we\u2019re so much more efficient, we believe we can hold the profit at a higher level. Certainly, margins will go up."

And overall, that business has been, in recent quarters, has trended around zero organic growth, and the contact centers lagged a little bit in it. So this has been something that has not been a secular growth driver for us. It\u2019s been the opposite. So this new technology here is something that we\u2019re hopeful that \u2013 and anticipates can drive growth and profit against that long-term demographic trend."

That shows a continuation of the health that we saw in June. So it\u2019s definitely too early to really talk about how July rent cycle closed out because the July rent cycle closes out in the second week of August. That\u2019s when you really know exactly how it finished out.

But also, we had a very strong performance on collections that led to the strong operating cash flow. As COVID began taking into effect, we quickly put together a cross-functional team involving our receivables team and our account managers to begin a collaborative discussion with all of our customers. Also, we quickly developed tools that enabled our teams to assess client health and begin identifying risks that we were seeing in the portfolios. These proactive measures led to an improvement of DSO of 8 days year-over-year. So we were down to 41 days. So the operating cash flow had a very nice quarter, really driven by the EBITDA growth and just very strong collections."

Most of our sales thrust right now is in virtual leasing and living, and we think we do have a competitive advantage in those areas. We certainly have a competitive advantage in all the revenue management technology, which is becoming more and more important as we move forward in time and start to optimize the pricing of amenities. It\u2019s no longer about just optimizing base rent. It\u2019s about how do you price parking spots and guest suites and all of the 140-some-odd amenities that owners can use to increase yield without raising base rent, which they\u2019re having a harder and harder time doing. So we think we\u2019ve got a good, strong competitive advantage there. I will say there is a lot of VC-backed smaller companies attacking this area of virtual leasing and living and really thinking about what is the next generation of apartment going to look like. So this is one of the reasons why we wanted to put more money on the balance sheet just so we were well prepared to capitalize, not just on our own internal innovation, but also look at what everybody else in the market is doing. And we\u2019re prudent acquiring innovation and not just building it ourselves."

It\u2019s analyzing literally hundreds of variables that drive what the price \u2013 optimal price should be. And it\u2019s working very effectively. We\u2019re seeing revenue managed properties outperform nonrevenue managed properties through the downturn very well. The distinction between urban and suburban is an interesting question. It appears that urban is under a little more pressure than suburban because I think the people that rent in a suburban location pay more because they enjoy all of the density and the amenities surrounding the urban apartments. As COVID hit, there really weren\u2019t a lot to do around those apartments. So I think a lot of residents just said, why are we paying $500 a month more to live here, and we can\u2019t do anything here versus live 20 miles north or south and essentially have more square footage at the same or lower price. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. I do think that\u2019s going to revert back when urban is \u2013 migration from suburban to urban was a clear trend we saw pre-COVID, and I think that will come back when the all safe sign is delivered."

Just looking at the revised 2020 guidance, based on our math, it implies about a $2 million increase at the midpoint, excluding 2Q\u2019s outperformance. So I guess my question is, why isn\u2019t 2Q strength carrying over into the rest of the year? I realized a lot of the top performance in the second quarter related to transactional revenues coming in better than forecast, but your comments on a surge in this virtual demand would seem to imply a bit more strength. I guess how much of that is timing related before we start to see this demand benefit the top line? And then just as a follow up to that, what kind of assumptions are you making in the second half in terms of the impact from transactional revenues? I believe the prior full year guidance assumed about a 150 to 250 basis point headwind for full year revenue growth?"

So I think our guidance range assumes a range of performance that includes some fairly negative scenarios without ruling out the most negative of economic scenarios. That include things such as little to no stimulus being renewed for the course of the year, while the upper end of the range continues more of the trajectory that we\u2019re seeing thus far this year. Stimulus was renewed. Continued health in the markets, continued ramping readiness and willingness to book and activate new projects with RealPage. And what that\u2019s enabled us to do \u2013 so now granted that uncertainty here in front of us, it\u2019s prudent to take a view and plan for \u2013 plan prudently as we think about those scenarios.",

The assumptions this year, we\u2019re looking at the upper half of our assumptions on what the impact would be. So we\u2019re thinking about the upper half of a 13% to 17% growth rate and 15% to 17% growth for the top line."

            "Thank you. And Tom, best wishes for you. I wanted to ask about \u2013 any color you can give us on the ACV growth that you had this quarter and the underpinning to it? How we should be thinking about that as we\u2019re rolling through the year? And not only new units, but any kind of direction, the 5% ARPU growth seems to be particularly strong, particularly as Buildium is growing, but any kind of color you could \u2013 or framework directional comments you could give us on how to think about the ACV growth through the year?"

            "Yes. Thanks for the question, Keith. So as we look at Q2, the ACV growth did mirror some of the comments I made around, and Buildium is certainly a strong contributor to that. Buildium \u2013 SimpleBills is also an acquisition that\u2019s a healthy growth driver for us, along with a number of the other functional areas within our product families that I highlighted in the prepared remarks. As we look forward, Steve paid a lot of attention to technologies that enable our customers to drive virtual leasing and living. We certainly have seen a pipeline shift towards some of those technologies and readiness to move to full online payments and portal technology. So there may be a marginal shift that direction as well. But I would think that the full year trend and the growth outlook at either the high or low end of our scenario is going to largely match what we\u2019re seeing here in the second quarter in terms of growth momentum besides that type of a shift."

            "So our guidance is \u2013 was specific to revenue growth. We don\u2019t guide generally on an ACV basis. Our organic growth \u2013 oh, yes, yes. So if you decompose the ACV growth, this might be a way to help you think about it as well, our unit growth has historically accounted for about three to four points of the growth. In the COVID environment, it\u2019s been a point or two lower than that. So depending on the health of the COVID environment, that may pick up and support higher growth. The rest of the growth has been an ARPU expansion. So I think as we decompose the range of our outcome expectation, it\u2019s more dependent on whether we see an acceleration on the unit side or not. But also, there\u2019s ARPU drivers as well. As Steve highlighted in the SMB success, we\u2019ve seen an ARPU expansion."

And so as you think about the cash flow generation, you just did some deals. Do you think about maintaining that steady debt levels where you are now? Or would you consider paying more down? But \u2013 or just any kind of color on how you\u2019re thinking about that? It seems like you want to leave the leverage ratios where they are, but just if you could just elaborate on what your plans are."

            "So we feel that we\u2019ve fully strengthened the balance sheet to be opportunistic in this environment. Our target leverage ratio of two to four times, we think, is optimal for driving financial return while enabling us to have flexibility to be out in the market and opportunistic in terms of bringing acquired innovators and innovation product into the \u2013 into our business. So it\u2019s at a comfortable reset type of position for us now. So we like where that is. And as we think about how we\u2019re managing that balance sheet, I did highlight that we have $632 million sitting on cash on the balance sheet. We\u2019re evaluating continuously the best way to optimally maintain that balance sheet and keep the flexibility. Right now, a fully reset revolver with cash on the balance sheet is attractive given the opportunities that we\u2019re looking at, but we are making continuous evaluations on how we can manage that to keep flexibility and to keep our costs well managed in terms of interest rate."

            "Great. Hi, Steve and Tom, best of luck in your new endeavors. I wanted to ask, it\u2019s been a unique situation in the industry because all the major software vendors have kind of come out and been pretty active and just talking about what they\u2019re seeing on their platforms, and I\u2019m wondering when you kind of span the industry and you appreciate how a RealPage platform customer is doing maybe versus some of the results you\u2019re hearing about on the competitor\u2019s platform, are you able to make a case that the breadth of your platform or just the actual results of your customers, they\u2019re actually fairing better right now than maybe some alternatives?"

And we constantly are monitoring how well our customers are doing through what we call customer business reviews where we compare their performance using our platform to their peer groups, and the peer groups will include some customers that are on RealPage and some that aren\u2019t. So generally, I feel pretty good about the health of the industry. But we do, of course, have this uncertainty with respect to the stimulus that we\u2019ll see going forward. So very positive right now.",
            "I expect August, we\u2019ll be a little bit shocked because I don\u2019t think these stimulus checks are going to get out at the first of the month. But hopefully by mid month, they will be in the hands of renters, and we won\u2019t have a problem. But right now, it\u2019s unknown."

And that\u2019s something we\u2019re actively ramping. And in this quarter, we\u2019re able to shift to a high rate of virtual delivery. And I think something we\u2019re getting even faster at to deliver more and more CBRs over time to really help the customer get engaged and get the effective technology into more properties."

            "And if I can squeeze in one more. The hiring in the sales team has continued to be really strong. And as I kind of thinking about getting a new rep ramped up and productive, I think, entering 2021, it seems like a lot of these new hires are going to be hitting the ground running. Is the thought that maybe you\u2019ll have productive reps in 2021, where the argument of improving yield and what\u2019s still maybe going to be a no rent growth environment is the thinking that maybe you\u2019ll be able to accelerate a RealPage organic growth? And have you given any thoughts, 10% to 12% still the right number? Or are all these factors coming together where it should actually be a bit better than that if you execute?"

            "Yes. Thanks for the question, Joe. And the idea obviously of investing in sales and marketing and the sales force, like I highlighted, and we did add 50 salespeople. It\u2019s definitely about driving organic growth. So it\u2019s a little early to project how that\u2019s going to support the growth rate next year. We\u2019ll hope to do that for you in a quarter or two, but that is absolutely the intent and purpose. And while clearly, we want them to be productive next year, we\u2019re not happy with waiting until next year.",
            "So as we decompose where those 50 salespeople are going and what we\u2019re doing operationally from a sales perspective, like the customer business reviews to the last question we just answered, the sales organization has responded really well with sales delivery in an all virtual environment in delivering more sales meetings, about two-thirds of those salespeople have come in on the early part of the sales funnel and the lead generation role to really try to supercharge this virtual selling environment. So we actually intend to try to drive productivity out of the expansion that we did in the second quarter this year, not next year. And I\u2019ll try to help us close out the year with strong bookings."
