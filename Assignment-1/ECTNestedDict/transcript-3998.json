After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].",

      "Randy Chesler": [
         "Alright, thank you Wanda. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me here in Kalispell this morning is Ron Copher, our Chief Financial Officer; Don Chery, our Chief Administrative Officer; Angela Dose, our Chief Accounting Officer; Byron Pollan, our Treasurer and Tom Dolan our Chief Credit Administrator.",
         "Yesterday we released our second quarter 2020 earnings and today we're ready to review the state of the company and the financial results. The second quarter was very solid and highlights the strong core of the company and the strength of our team and our business model, despite the stiff headwinds caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to navigate through the pandemic extremely well and I'm exceptionally proud of the Glacier team, their commitment and leadership and their service to their communities. ",
         "As I noted in our last earnings call, the Glacier franchise covers almost 1,500 miles from Montana to Arizona and the impact of the pandemic is different across that franchise. Our unique business model with 16 different divisions serving over 140 communities provides us with the unique capability to respond to our employees, customers and communities in a way that best suits that local market. We continue to take advantage of our model today to respond to the quickly changing conditions.",
         "At this time most of our locations had moved back to drive through service with in-lobby meetings by appointment. This is in response to a resurgence of the virus in many of our markets. Most of our eight states have active cases and mortality rates well below the national average, but are still seeing increase in cases with more testing. ",
         "Despite the pandemic, we are amazed at how well customers have adjusted to the circumstances and are carrying on with business. Our mortgage volume is at record levels with the refinancing and new home purchases, our commercial lending business is beginning to pick up and many of our business customers report solid increased activity. ",
         "As expected, tourism in our western markets has generally rebounded very well due to a lot of pent-up desire to get out of the house and travel. Our markets were strong before the pandemic, driven by high quality of life, business friendly environments and low cost of living, and we're seeing some signs that the natural social distancing that comes with our more rural markets will add to the attractiveness of our markets. ",
         "And now on to our results for the second quarter. Once again the second quarter results really highlighted the consistent strength of our core business. We reported earnings per share of $0.66, an 8% or $0.05 increase from the prior year second quarter.",
         "Net income was $63.4 million, which is an increase of $11.1 million or 21% from the prior year second quarter. And highlighting the company's core earnings strength pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue for the quarter was $91.3 million, which was up 41% from the prior year second quarter. Core deposits increased $1.8 billion or 16% over the prior quarter, with non-interest bearing deposit growth of $1.2 billion or 30%. Non-interest bearing deposits were 38% of total core deposits at the end of this quarter compared to 34% at the end of the quarter a year ago. ",
         "Deposits continue to flow into the balance sheet, so we significantly reduced our federal and home loan bank borrowings by $475 million during the quarter to about $40 million and put an additional focus on reducing the cost of deposits given the drop in interest rates. We were pleased to see our cost of core deposits decline to 14 basis points from 20 in the prior quarter and the total cost of funding dropped to 21 basis points from 29 in the prior quarter.",
         "The loan portfolio organically increased $1.4 billion or 14% in the quarter and increased $1.5 billion or 17% from the prior year quarter. All the loan growth in the current quarter and most of the deposit growth was due to our paycheck protection program or PPP loans. We have approved and closed over 15,000 PPP loans for about $1.4 billion with most of these funds deposited in accounts with us.",
         "We expect to earn about $55 million in fee income from these loans. So as part of this effort, we also acquired over 3,000 new customers who received PPP loans from us totaling close to $298 million in loans. This was due to a number of our competitors that were struggling with offering the PPP program. ",
         "Total debt securities of $3.7 billion increased $104 million or 3% during the quarter and increased $1 billion or 37% from the prior year second quarter. Net interest margin was tough to hold as we saw it drop from 4.36% last quarter to 4.12% today, dragged down by the 150 basis point reduction of short term rates by the Federal Reserve in late March. ",
         "Pricing on new production during the quarter was around 440 verses our portfolio rate of about 485. Last quarter's new production yields averaged 480. The core margin looked better ending the quarter at 421 versus 430 in the prior quarter and 427 a year ago. The pace of PPP loans forgiveness could help the margin in the next few quarters, as fee income will be accelerated upon forgiveness. ",
         "Now last night the SBA issued some direction on how and when to submit the forgiveness applications and we look forward to getting started with the process, which according to the SBA will most likely started in mid-August. Longer term though, we still expect lower rates will continue to put downward pressure on our margin. ",
         "The return on our debt securities held up well, ending the quarter at 3.16% up 6 basis points from the prior quarter. Debt security income was $26 million, which was an increase of $5 million or 23% over the prior quarter and 18% over the prior year quarter. This shows the effectiveness of the actions we have taken to maintain our investment portfolio returns. ",
         "Non-interest income was driven by a record mortgage production. We booked gain on sale of loans of $26 million, which was $14 million over the prior quarter on increase of 118% and $18 million or 233% over the quarter a year ago. Mortgage purchase and refinance business continues to be very strong and we've seen an uptick in a number of our out-of-state buyers in addition to strong local demand. ",
         "Credit performance was better than expected with net charge-offs at $1.2 million or 2 basis points of total loans, about the same as the prior quarter. Delinquent loans were 22 basis points of loans versus 41 last quarter and 43 a year ago. Non-performing assets increased $7 million, but were 27 basis points of assets, which was up 1 basis points from the prior quarter and was 14 basis points less than the level a year ago. For the quarter, excluding PPP loans, our NPA's would have been 30 basis points of assets. ",
         "We've also made over 3,000 loan modifications on loans totaling over $1.5 billion, representing about 15% of the portfolio, excluding PPP loans. We have received regulatory flexibility to make these modifications and there are a good way to help customers get through severe, but hopefully short term business disruption like we're now seeing. ",
         "Both the triple PPP loans and the modification help customers maintain and build their balance sheets, while they get back to business. We\u2019ve also made in excess of $200 million in PPP loans to the modification customers that will provide additional support. ",
         "We finalized closing many of these modified loans a bit later in the second quarter, as we were very busy with handling the record number of loan requests for PPP loans. While most of the modifications are for three months, we'll begin to see the majority of them come up for renewal in a few more weeks. We expect to see a good number of these customers go back to paying as agreed. It's important to note that all of these loans that receive the modification were performing as agreed before we gave them the modification. ",
         "In addition to relying on the substantial inherent strength of the loan portfolio, we've implemented enhanced monitoring of industries that we think pose higher risk due to the pandemic. The total amount of loans under enhanced monitoring is $630 million or 6.29% of our portfolio. This includes loans in the following industries, Hotel/motel, restaurants, travel, tourism, gaming and oil and gas. ",
         "The largest industry with increased risk in our portfolio is our Hotel/motel loans totaling $422 million or 4.2% of the portfolio. Most of these hotel loans are smaller loans less than $1.5 million and have an LTV under 60%. Most of you know that we have not materially increased our position in hotels for over three years, so many of these loans have a good amount of equity, which generally translates into a lower debt burden. ",
         "The next largest exposure in the higher risk group is restaurants, totaling $151 million or 1.5% of the loan portfolio. Similar to our hotel portfolio, these are smaller loans with an average loan size of 175,000 and comprised of a solid group of operators. Many of these owners have already started to adapt to a new operating model by shifting to take out while they wait for the ability to reopen fully. We plan to continue with our enhanced monitoring process of these industries for the foreseeable future. ",
         "Credit loss expense of $13.6 million for the quarter brings us up to $36.3 million for the year and 1.42% of loans, 1.62% of loans not including the PPP loans which are a 100% guaranteed. This is a 13 basis point increase over the last quarter. This increase is primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the economic forecast, and not deterioration in the underlying credit portfolio. Our allowance for credit loss stands at $162.5 million, which we believe is a very adequate and prudent amount given the uncertain circumstances. ",
         "Total non-interest expense was $98.1 million, which increased $6.2 million or 7% over the prior quarter, and increased $12 million or 13% over the quarter a year ago. For the quarter the efficiency ratio was 49.29%, an improvement compared to the prior quarter efficiency ratio of 52.55%. On the year-to-date basis the company's efficiency ratio was 50.81%, improving from the 54.93% efficiency ratio for the first half of last year. ",
         "The company's capital levels remained very strong with CET1 ending the quarter at 12.35% up compared to 12.14% at the end of the prior quarter and up from 12.19% from the quarter a year ago. Tangible book value per share was $17.08 at the end of the second quarter and increase from $16.35 at the end of the prior quarter, and increased from $15.03 from the prior year's second quarter.",
         "Our access to liquidity remains robust with growth due to an increase in core deposits and borrowing capacity. At the end of the second quarter the company had access to over $11 billion in liquidity. This includes $5.6 billion of unused borrowing capacity with $2.6 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank, $2.6 billion in borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window and PPP liquidity facility and $400 million of capacity at correspondent banks, in addition to $1.6 billion in un-pledged and marketable securities and cash, of $547 million. ",
         "An additional $3.5 billion in liquidity is available from other sources, including broker deposits, over pledged securities and loans eligible for pledging at the Federal Home Loan Bank. ",
         "So, in March we declared our 141st consecutive dividend. With our robust capital and liquidity position, we don't see any change in our dividend strategy at this time. Dividends have been and remain one of our preferred excess capital management strategies. ",
         "And a few important items before I end my comments. We completed the operational conversion of Heritage Bank in Reno, and I'm pleased to report that the conversion went very smoothly, and it will be good to have the Heritage Bank on the company's core platform. My thanks to the Glacier and Heritage teams for an excellent conversion. ",
         "S&P selected Glacier to become part of a MidCap 400, moving up from a Small-Cap 600. And finally, bank director just this week published the 2020 Bank Director Scorecard and we moved up in the rankings quite a bit. For banks with assets between $5 billion and $50 billion nationally, we are in the Top 5, number 4, that's up from number 16 last year. So overall, an outstanding performance from the team. ",
         "That ends my formal remarks. And I\u2019d not ask Wanda to open the line for any questions that you may have. "

            "You know how that's going to change; we do expect it to get accelerated. We just are a little uncertain about the pace of that as I noted. I mean just last night the SBA gave us direction on how to submit the paperwork for those forgiveness loan applications, and so we believe that's going to start in mid-August. ",
            "They have 90 days then to turn that around and so probably going to see most, a fair amount of activity in the fourth quarter, probably spilling over into the first quarter. So some acceleration of those loans will happen in those two quarters and that's still subject to you know the SBA sticking to the process that they outlined last night. "

You guys have a very broad foot print obviously with a lot of different, subsidiary banks. So just trying to think about, you know kind of what may be driving strength or weakness in various areas and what areas you may see some credit issues pop-up if any?"

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah, well I'd say I'm very, very surprised that the strong level of activity across the total footprint, starting in Arizona where you see a lot of press about the virus and issues, but talking to business owners in the market, there is a surprising consistency and back-to-business that's going on there. ",
            "And for example, one of our customer builds roads. You know they are backlogged; they\u2019re doing more business than they ever have with all the infrastructure investment. Another one in the car business, pace of \u2013 can't get enough cars to sell. So home builders you know reporting a lot of activity on new homes, and so we see a surprising amount of activity, no real areas of weakness popping up. If you go, it kind of moves further north into Utah similar story; Nevada, all the way up into Montana. ",
            "So we are hearing from our customers that business is resuming and nothing is really starting to bubble to the surface at this point as an area that other than the enhanced risk areas that are already mentioned that areas that we are concerned about. "

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And then maybe just last one for me. You noted kind of the decline in loan yields. I'd imagine there has been some maybe loan spreads widening and we may not expect this faster turn of kind of refinances and what not within the books. So just on a core basis, do you feel like there is an ability to kind of hold loan yields around that, new loan yields around that 440 level or do you think there's going to be incremental pressure from there?

So you know we think on that \u2013 if it holds where it is today, you're probably looking more at kind of 425 to 450 range in this quarter on new production, and whether I think that you know holds or gets a little better is really a function of what's going on in the interest rate curve.

Maybe remind us \u2013 the moves you made in late Q1 and the securities brought certainly hoped [ph] based yields in the second quarter. I guess I\u2019m trying to recall, how does that support strength into the third quarter if at all, and maybe just stops overall on the margin. You noted the, maybe the loan yield pressure, but you got a lot of liquidity and just want to see how that shakes out, a lot of moving pieces? "

      },
      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah, so we bought those late March and the great deals we got, put on the munis, about 70% of the $725 million were high quality muni\u2019s and the tax equivalent yield there was 4.12%. We also bought of that $725 million 30% were corporate which were the set banks, you know the large names through it, J.P. Morgan, etc. ",
            "So those were 435, so we blended all and we have a 420 yield and that's what showed up in the second quarter, and that will continue really till those things are called, with the munis based on a very long call today. ",
            "So we think this will continue to be an under pending, you know certainly through next year and feel very good about that. We initially funded those at FHLB, but as Randy talked about in his remarks, we\u2019ve been able to pay down those borrowing and so now we're really financing that list, so deposit costs, that came down nicely. So both sides of it has really helped. ",
            "And then just on the \u2013 what we have been doing with the excess liquidity, which really showed up towards the latter half of June, we just purchased a week ago, just about $170 million of securities. 80% were residential mortgage backed securities, Fannie, Freddie, 20% were structured corporate MBSs and the combined yield, 84 basis points. So that's just where the market has come. So that\u2019s why \u2013 I want you to know that, because that's why opportunistically that three days in late March when we were able to buy what I described, we really pulled forward things that we would have bought otherwise.

I guess just thoughts on what\u2019s the \u2013 you know how you plan to or just thoughts on additional reserve builds going forward in the back half of the year and you know implication.

            "Yeah, so let me start with the 3,000 customers. I would tell you that a fair amount of these were people that we wanted to do business with. That we had been calling on for a number of years and then PPP, if you turn the clock back to when this first started, there was a lot of anxiety around this and a number of the money center banks were very slow in their response to the customers, and that was the \u2013 and some of them, the straw that broke the camel's back and they came over to one of our divisions and that's a fair portion of those 3,000 people that we've been looking to get into the bank and a fair amount of them were you know with the money center banks. ",
            "And so step one is, we now have a deeper relationship with them, with the PPP. They all \u2013 all the \u2013 we did require our accounts to be open, so we do have that established now, and I think you know that is a project for the next year for us, is to deepen those relationships. So we just had last month an all-hands on deck meeting with all our divisions, talking specifically about how to \u2013 we spent a day and a half talking about how to deepen those relationships now that we have them in the bank, and if you think about it, it's like a small acquisition for us. Its 3,000 new customers into the bank, all the lending relationships that are an opportunity. ",
            "So we'll see how we do. We are very focused on it and that's one of the things we have on our to-do list for the next year, is further deepen those relationships and pull over the good business that\u2019s sitting in another bank right now. ",
            "In terms of new commercial lenders, we\u2019re pretty well staffed. I mean I think we always maintain a list of people who want to come on over to Glacier, but \u2013 and as really good opportunities present themselves, we take advantage of it. But I think there is \u2013 you know generally we have a good short list in most of our markets of people we know we'd like to have join us when the time is right. But right now our focus is on those 3,000 new customers and you know how to deepen that relationship over the next 12 months or so. "

You know where there\u2019s much excess capital as you have and a strong credit performance, when do you think you can return to dividend growth? What are you hearing from the regulators? Do you think you\u2019d get pushed back if you try to raise your dividend now or just maybe any of your thoughts, overall thoughts on capital deployment and capital return?"

I think you just need to be smart about it I guess from our point of view, which is to have a very \u2013 maintain very solid capital and very solid liquidity and keep your payout ratio in a reasonable range, because I think it's a legitimate regulatory concern at this point to make sure that banks retain capital and don't push it all out through dividend. ",
            "So I think it\u2019s sensitive, may be more of an issue for companies that are paying out a higher percentage of earnings with little less capital, but I \u2013 you know from an industry regulatory standpoint, I don't think it's on the front burner. But from our standpoint we don't really want it to become an issue, so we're going to be proactive to make sure we take steps to ensure that we're all able to pay a dividend. "

It's actually been fairly significant over the quarter. Customers are using their lines of credit less and less, which you know from my chair speaks to the strength of their balance sheets and the lack of need for borrowed funds. But as the negative side of that is it increases, the unfunded balances and the unfunded liability that goes along with it.",

They have longer weighted average lives and can be you know \u2013 can have as Randy mentioned, a little bit more volatile change. ",

We\u2019ll also see some seasoning of the construction portfolio as those draws continue.

You know the reductions, the combination of normal amortization and then as I mentioned earlier, we had some pay downs on the revolving side, which a portion of were from the enhanced risk portfolio. And just like anything, there are stronger credits and there are weaker credits, so in terms of new originations, I wouldn't say that we're actively looking to increase the hotel or restaurant portfolio, but there may be the exception here and there. It just really depends on the individual credit in and of itself. "
