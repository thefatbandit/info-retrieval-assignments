         "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us despite your busy schedule. We appreciate your kind attendance or participation. Before I start the explanation, may I offer my sincere sympathies to those who are affected by COVID-19 as well as to those people who are affected by the heavy rainfall that took place in July of 2020.",
         "I would now like to take the floor and briefly talk about the consolidated financial results as well as the forecast for this fiscal year. So please turn to Page 4 of the material. Page 4, please. This talks about the status of consolidated results for the first quarter. We experienced a decline in both operating revenue and operating income. Operating revenue dropped by 5.1% year-on-year. The decline in overseas was quite large, standing at 8% decline. Domestic revenues dropped by 3.8% year-on-year. As for operating income, we were able to cover the drop in revenue through various cost reduction, so operating income dropped by 1.5% year-on-year. We\u2019re able to keep the decline in operating income to 1.5%.",
         "Now as for impact of COVID-19 on our first quarter results, the negative impact on revenue was JPY 70 billion, a negative impact on operating income was JPY 10 billion. Let me now talk about the contributing factors by segment. Please take a look at this chart. Let\u2019s start with the mobile communication business. This was already announced by DOCOMO previously. Operating revenue dropped, and operating income grew year-on-year. The reduction in handset sales revenue as well as in global roaming revenue and drop in mobile communications service revenue due to expanded impact from the new rate plan was offset by cost reduction, so operating income increased year-on-year.",
         "Turning now to regional communication business, on the right-hand side. The top shows operating revenue, the bottom shows operating income. Voice service revenue as well as hospital-related revenue dropped due to the impact of COVID-19. There was also loss from retirement of unnecessary fixed assets. And also, there was cost for developing environment to respond to COVID-19. So operating income in this segment dropped year-on-year. As for long distance and international communication business, well, there is decline in operating revenue due to COVID-19 in foreign currency.",
         "Operating income grew year-on-year due to freezing of measures as well as cost reduction from structural reform, which was undertaken overseas last year. As for data communications segment, this was already announced earlier by NTT DATA. There is increase in operating revenue but decline in operating income. This is primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. So a decline in operating income year-on-year. As for the others \u2013 other business, NTT Urban Solutions, there is impact from COVID-19, but due to expanded consolidation, operating revenue increased year-on-year.",
         "Operating income remained more or less at the same level as that of the previous year. Let me now turn to the overview of fiscal year 2020 financial forecast. Please take a look at the overview, which is indicated on this page. Let me talk about the impact from COVID-19. Operating revenue, there\u2019s going to be a decrease of JPY 350 billion and a decrease of JPY 70 billion in operating income as a result of COVID-19. So what are the causes of this impact? What is the backdrop? We are assuming that in Japan, there will not be any reissuance of state of emergency declaration. And economic activity is expected to gradually recover following the lifting of the state of emergency in May.",
         "So we are anticipating gradual recovery in the domestic economy. That is the assumption for this forecast as for overseas. While we see a similar trend, per se, there are variances from country to country. So while recovery is expected to gradually occur overseas as well. The recovery is expected to be slower than in Japan, particularly in places such as Europe and in the United States. So as a result, operating revenue expected to decrease significantly by approximately JPY 400 billion compared to fiscal year 2019.",
         "Operating income \u2013 operating profit will increase compared to fiscal year 2019, covered by approximately JPY 80 billion of reduction in capital investment and JPY 100 billion reduction in cost. So we are anticipating an increase in operating income as well as in profit year-on-year next \u2013 this fiscal year.",
         "So let me talk about some concrete numbers, which are indicated on the following page. Please take a look at this list. So operating revenue, JPY 11.5 trillion, a decline of roughly JPY 400 billion year-on-year. Of the JPY 30 million to JPY 50 million impact of COVID-19, domestic impact is roughly JPY 180 billion, and overseas impact is roughly JPY 170. So domestic and overseas contribute 50% roughly in terms of the impact on operating revenue.",
         "Turning to operating income, we are anticipating increase of close to JPY 30 billion, and we are anticipating JPY 1.59 trillion. The impact is on operating income from COVID-19 is larger on domestic business. As for net profit, slight increase in EPS is expected to increase very slightly.",
         "Next page, please. This is the financial forecast summary by company. So how would each company fair in terms of the forecast summary? This is the list. So please take a look at the horizontal line. Operating revenue \u2013 operating income. DOCOMO number has already shown, operating revenue decline but operating income will increase. As for NTT East and West, both will experience increase in both operating revenue and operating income. That is the plan, that is in place for NTT East and West.",
         "For NTT West, they will achieve increase in both operating revenue and operating income for the first time since the establishment of the company. As for NTT East, this is an increase in both operating revenue and operating income for the first time since 2010. For one thing, this is due to increase in revenue from expanded net increase in the fiber sales and also due to contributions from cost reduction and also increase in activities from the subsidiaries. So that is the situation.",
         "As for long distance and international communications segment, we carry that restructuring and reorganization last year.",
         "So we cannot do year-on-year comparison. So that is why we\u2019re showing you the performance of the segment. So we\u2019re anticipating decline in operating revenue, but increase in operating income and impact from structural reform will play into this picture. As for entity data, as was already announced previously, decline in operating revenue as well as in operating income. So due to COVID-19 and also due to the structure reform that has taken place in the United States. In terms of operating revenue, is expected to decline for the first time since the company was first established in 1988. That is the forecast at this juncture for NTT DATA.",
         "As for NTT Urban Solutions, they\u2019re expecting increase in revenue but decline in operating income. Real estate revenue will expand due to consolidation, but operating income is expected to decline. And next page, please. By segment summary, I already explained at the individual operating company explanation before, so I would like to skip this. Now I\u2019d like to move on to topics. Over here, too, I would like to take enough time to receive your questions.",
         "So I would like to \u2013 just briefly like to explain about that we will be shifting our focus on the remote work. And we\u2019ll be having a system to support that in October. And the remote world is that what we are seeking for to realize. And we would like to provide services that will support realizing such a remote world, and we are thinking of providing seven services, especially a safe service and also function-wise, that has a competitive superiority against the competitors. So for the online conferences or the local government work processes, automation tools.",
         "And also, service providing that conversation will be realized through glass panels or acrylic panels, called Window Talk. Next page, I would like to touch upon the overview of the medium-term management strategy initiative progress. The 5G technology, at least one antenna has been installed in all of the prefectures in Japan at the end of June. And also the first attempt as a group, NTT Group green bond has been issued in June also. So for the rest of the information, I would like you to take a look later. That is all from my side. Thank you very much."

         "Thank you very much for attending today despite your busy schedules. We will now start the briefing of NTT\u2019s financial results for the first quarter. I am Fujiki from the IR Office and will be serving as today\u2019s facilitator.",
         "First, I would like to introduce today\u2019s attending members.

After this, President, Mr. Sawada will explain the financial results, outline and others. Then we will open the floor for questions. Mr. Sawada, please.",
         "We would now like to take your questions. We\u2019ll take questions from those who have registered beforehand and who are already connected to the internet conference system, as we have already informed you in advance. As for the \u2013 which will take your questions. The operator will explain, we will take your questions. Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "I have several questions. The impact of COVID-19 on our operating income. The domestic impact was quite significant. That is my frank impression. So can explain how negatively, COVD-19 can have impact? I note that overseas is probably the slowdown in sales before about the domestic breakdown in domestic and overseas. What is the breakdown of the JPY 70 billion impact on operating income between domestic and overseas, can you elaborate, please? That\u2019s my first question."

         "Remarks": [
            "In terms of operating income, yes, we anticipate JPY 45 billion impact on domestic operating income. The most significant factor would be probably, has the gross profit for DOCOMO and also the international roaming service revenue decline. So that would be the two major factors on decline in operating income. So that will come close to JPY 30 billion total.",
            "Furthermore, as for data, and as for NTT Urban Solutions and other business, for NTT DATA, the domestic impact is not that large. But in other business, we believe that because they\u2019re building centric businesses there affected by COVID-19. So that\u2019s the situation for the domestic business. As there are several tens of billions, several billions of yen impact [Technical Difficulty] in operating income.",
            "As for overseas, so JPY 25 billion impact on operating income, that\u2019s primarily, as you pointed out, from system integration-related decline. In other words, decline in pipeline translated into operating decline, operating income."

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "The JPY 100 billion set by DOCOMO and/or JPY 100 billion. They are not based on same definition. Although, we talk about cost reduction. We talked about JPY 100 million cost reduction in this presentation this time around. So this aggregation of impact of COVID-19 on a net basis, yes, there is the negative impact as was deposit impact from COVID-19. So that\u2019s been netted out. So that \u2013 the net impact is JPY 70 billion. Net impact is negative JPY 70 billion on operating income.",
            "And also, there\u2019s JPY 30 billion positive impact. So JPY 100 billion cost reduction will come into play. So DOCOMO\u2019s \u2013 so certain percentage of DOCOMO\u2019s cost reduction is reflected in JPY 100 billion, but that is not actually \u2013 that is not actually straightforward, I think. So we believe JPY 100 billion is cost reduction. So that\u2019s JPY 100 billion is offsetting the loss in operating income. Yes, that\u2019s the case."

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. As regional communication, gets lumpy, increase in operating revenue, so operating revenue increase in regional communication, that is historic. But in the first quarter, I think there\u2019s \u2013 operating revenue declined in the first quarter. So are you saying that 7 is probably the second, third quarter and fourth quarter, you\u2019re anticipating increase in operating revenue is despite the decline in operating income in the first quarter?"

      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "As for NTT East, NTT BP, the equity portion was 50% NTT, which means that there is expansion in the consolidation of NTT East. As you know, telecom service revenue was on a downward trend in East, but then that is not being offset and that positive impact is expected in second quarter onwards. So that is the impact. And so that is the situation rather for NTT East.",
            "As for NTT West, one noteworthy aspect is that NTT MARKETING ACT and Smart Connect to the subsidiary firms for NTT West. They are actually explosion positive impact from COVID-19. So on a full year basis, that is going to contribute. So that\u2019s one noteworthy aspect for NTT West. And there was one common element for both NTT East and West. Its that in the first quarter, there is 80,000 net increase for fiber. So in the first quarter, yes, net increase was 80,000 for fiber for NTT East and West.",
            "So if we take a look at this on a full year basis, we believe that there is going to be the possibility of increase in operating revenue for NTT East and West. So yes, things were somewhat difficult for the first quarter because of the front-loading of cost. But going forward, we believe that the situation will ease, and then they will turn transition to increase in network revenue increase. One \u2013 there was a reference to NTT Smart Connect. The name should be Solmare. It\u2019s not Smart Connect. It should be NTT Solmare. I just want to make that correction."

But deposit impact from structural reform that was carried out in 2019. I think that should be a most positive driver. What is the contribution for the structural reform that was carried out in 2019?"

As for NTT DATA, they\u2019re anticipating JPY 4 billion further cost \u2013 structural reform cost, and also as well as in the United States. So on a net basis, I think the impact will be negative for NTT DATA as far as the structural reform cost is concerned."

            "This is Kikuchi speaking. I have two questions. The first question is related to Mr. Masuno\u2019s question. It\u2019s regarding NTT Ltd. firm\u2019s effect. How much, and what kind of effect have been generated? Is it on the cost side? The top line is declining. So improving and strengthening the top line, are you seeing effects that has improved the competitiveness? And because of that, is there a large increase in profit? And due to COVID-19, there\u2019s a large impact of decline in revenue. So what is the impact of COVID-19? And what is going to happen to that impact moving forward? That\u2019s my first question."

      },
      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you very much for your question. Regarding NTT Ltd. structural reform, it was a JPY 30 billion. And of that, the JPY 20 billion is personnel expenses. We have conducted quite a bit of streamlining. So the remaining JPY 10 billion will be other expenses related. And so we are seeing an effect in terms of cash. In the top line increase, there\u2019s about JPY 10 billion of foreign exchange impact included in that number. And furthermore, this time, we had accounting system changes in the NTT Ltd, and product selling that does not have a high added value.",
            "We are just going to record the commission fee. And that\u2019s about JPY 10 billion. And the remaining COVID-19 impact is also there. But top line-wise, the decline other than COVID-19 impact is not that large. The high-added value services, it\u2019s about 30% of the overall revenue composition, and that has increased up to 36%. And so in that sense \u2013 so the revenue structure is shifting over to a higher margin. In 2023, we would like to increase that portion up to 50%. So we are on that track towards that target, and we are seeing a positive impact of going through that track this fiscal year."

         "Remarks": [
            "Understood. So the COVID-19 impact for NTT DATA, they have announced their results last week, and we have heard explanation. And NTT DATA has more impact from it. And the reason behind that is probably because for NTT Ltd., they have a positive effect, too? Is that the reason?"

            "Okay. Understood. My second question, well, if it\u2019s just about COVID-19, it seems that it\u2019s not enough. So the other day, you have a net alliance with NEC. And it\u2019s only been about a month since you made that announcement. However, are there any progresses are made? Or is it being highly received by other people? Or maybe people are asking you to explain about it more. But within the last month, is there something that you can share as an update with us?"

Therefore, the overseas sales strategy included is also discussed. And what we will be selling? Of course, we need to think of that also. However, IP, the NTT has in the technology and NEC\u2019s IP and technology, they will be combined together.

As for overseas, it seems that you\u2019re freezing some of the measures. That\u2019s what you alluded to. I think that\u2019s what you mentioned or indicated in the beginning of the year. So on this point, now that the first quarter is over, did you implement these actions? And also, in terms of the full year plan, restructuring costs have that been reflected and factored in. Or are you going to defer this? That\u2019s my first question."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you. As you pointed out, for this fiscal year, we do anticipate some restructuring-related cost as well. But in the first quarter, the pace was quite slow. So at the end of the day we\u2019ve been able to actually narrow down on such cost. In mid-May, to all the subsidiary firms with regard to measures, we have asked that they be \u2013 that they practice self-restraint. So \u2013 and I believe that has been understood well by various companies, including those outside Japan.",
            "And as for PMI, we have been considering two-year PMI and response to regulators. So that has been significantly affected by COVID-19. So that type of cost will probably deferred to a certain extent. So \u2013 and it is \u2013 and although there\u2019s three month, today we\u2019ll be changing the name of the companies, but also IT system-related actions might be somewhat delayed as well. So that cost is also likely to be pushed back."

So against this backdrop, the positive aspect is the new solutions and network services will be launched. So the positive impact from COVID-19 will probably come into play down the road.",

That is because we had quite a high expectation. But after that, there was a very strict lockdown. And the assumption was that we will have no more pipeline, new pipeline coming in. But compared to that, in reality, we had the order backlog up till now.",

            "So there is some reshuffling. But when I said about the operating EBITA net. So it goes down, but something will go up. So as a total, it\u2019s about 60% is where it\u2019s going to settle at is what we expect. However, if we look at NTT Ltd. situation, at the first quarter, there\u2019s no impact on the profit in terms of COVID-19 because they\u2019re still remaining the business on the order backlog. However, moving forward, in the next three quarters, they expect about JPY 10 billion. That is not because in the first quarter, the pipeline they were expected to have, they weren\u2019t able to have it. So because of that from second quarter onwards, it will be an impact on the remaining quarters. So the system integration will have a large impact in the second half and the profit will also increase largely in the second half."

What kind of content of the improvement is this? So if you can give me the large picture on the improvement.

But the main reason is that last year, we conducted the structural reform in July. So it\u2019s up to that, that when we compare the quarter-to-quarter basis. But after the structural reform, various people, including back office people, we had quite of a sufficient amount of \u2013 in terms of a number of people. So we streamlined that. So through the streamlining processes, they\u2019re able to reduce by JPY 30 billion. And that actually pushed up the profitability of the business.",
            "And for NTT DATA side, the situation has not largely changed. Therefore, NTT\u2019s limited improvement has largely contributed to the improvement of margin. That\u2019s the large picture. And regarding the high value-added services, managed services, a company secured 24 or the web service the company, Arkadin, they are increasing their profitability. But both of them are related to a remote working or solutions that can respond to COVID-19. So in that sense, the reason why the high value-added products are increasing is because there is increasing demand for those type of new solutions."

So it\u2019s a company that carries out corporate marketing. So it\u2019s more or less a call center. So I think increase in demand is primarily due to subcontracting of call center operations. So local governments and municipalities, their call centers are also being carried out by MARKETING ACT. So I think they\u2019re increasing that capacity.

The content is the service strategy, meaning that after COVID-19, it will be a remote world more.
