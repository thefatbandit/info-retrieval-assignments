      "Darin Harris": [
         "Thank you, Rachel, and good morning. I\u2019d first like to take a moment to express my heartfelt thanks to our restaurant team members for keeping everyone\u2019s safety a top priority, as we provide for the needs of our guests and first responders. I\u2019d also like to thank our corporate employees, franchisees and suppliers for their partnership flexibility and ingenuity during these unprecedented times. I\u2019ve only been in the role for a little over 6 weeks now, but they\u2019ve been a very busy 6 weeks. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to make burgers, cook tacos with team members in our restaurant. I\u2019ve met with many of our valued franchisees, and I have onboarded with many of the corporate staff.",
         "In addition, I\u2019ve also spent a significant amount of time with my executive leadership team. And through all of these interactions, I have been extremely impressed with the nimbleness of this brand and the willingness of our employees and our franchisees to pivot towards keeping our guests safe as well as our staff safe, which has enabled us to drive strong results in the middle of a pandemic. The passion for the brand has been evident in every interaction.",
         "As mentioned last quarter, Jack pivoted early in the pandemic to capitalize on changing consumer trends, including changing media placements, leaning into delivery and offering indulgent, flavorful and portable menu items. Sales for the third quarter were the direct result of this, up 6.6%. Sales accelerated throughout the third quarter and the momentum from the end of the quarter has continued so far into the fourth quarter. We won\u2019t get into too many specifics, but this performance drives our continued outlook to be cautiously optimistic. Additionally, we will be thoughtful about what we\u2019ve learned throughout the pandemic and apply it to future strategies to help preserve this momentum.",
         "Sales and cash flow remain robust, and the company is in a very strong position amidst the pandemic. Lance will share more detail on this in a minute. As we look at the results for the third quarter, same-store sales were the strongest in 5 years, since the third quarter of 2015. I will take a minute to outline some of the key success drivers.",
         "Over the past few years, the team has been dialing in the right value equation to drive overall sales. In 2019 and into 2020, we experienced success with our $4.99 bundles and upsell and add-on strategies. We continue to see these price-pointed offers appealing to our core consumers during this time.",
         "We also continue to benefit from our innovation. Since the launch in mid-January, Tiny Tacos have remained highly incremental to our overall performance. We\u2019ve seen sustained success from them over the past 6 or so months and they certainly appeal to off-premise occasions as they are featured in a takeout box and are very portable. Consumer response remains strong and Tiny Tacos are helping to bring attention to the entire taco category. Tiny Tacos drove transactions and bolstered check sizes, as they\u2019re frequently added on to guest orders.",
         "We also launched our popcorn chicken, an indulgent product that is, again, portable and snackable during this pandemic while capitalizing on chicken trends. Our successful promotions in prior quarters have included a thoughtful upsell strategy, but popcorn chicken has been the most successful, offering double the chicken for $2 more. These upsell strategies are not only easy for our crews to execute, they enable the guests to get what they want at a great value and support profitability of these promotions for us and our franchisees.",
         "Customers also start \u2013 are also starting to acknowledge our speed improvement. Customer perceptions of speed of service improved significantly in the third quarter, reflecting our continued focus on giving the guests an experience that is consistent and quick and will make them want to return.",
         "Aside from these continued strategies, we are also seeing shifts in our business as a result of changes from consumer behavior amidst COVID. First, consumers are utilizing delivery and our mobile app more than ever. Delivery and mobile app sales remain approximately double what they were prior to the pandemic. As a reminder, over 95% of our restaurants are covered by at least one of the four major delivery providers, with 80% utilizing at least three of the major providers. We continue to integrate our POS systems with these third-party providers, allowing for simpler procedures for the restaurants.",
         "Second, occasions have shifted away from the traditional breakfast daypart with consumers no longer commuting to work. But since we offer anything on the menu any time of day, we are seeing plenty of breakfast items selling later in the day. While the breakfast daypart has certainly been impacted, by the end of the third quarter, all five of our dayparts were positively contributing to overall sales performance.",
         "Third, we\u2019ve increased sales of our more premium and indulgent items, items such as our homestyle chicken sandwich and Classic Buttery Jack. Consumers are now placing larger orders as well, typically for multiple people. These shifts in consumer behavior have led to a sustained significant increase in our check sizes during the pandemic.",
         "As our sales have improved, we shifted some of our marketing spend. The media team has been extremely nimble, leveraging consumer consumption trends around gaming and binging on social and video content to really meet the consumer where they are during this time. For example, if you recall, we moved media away from sports last quarter as most events were canceled. Now that they\u2019re back, albeit in a very different capacity, we are incorporating our brand into content and placements that makes sense to the fans watching from home.",
         "Now switching gears to unit growth. Franchisees opened four new restaurants in the quarter and closed six restaurants. This brings our year-to-date total to 20 new restaurants and 19 closures, one of which was company owned. For those of you that attended my meet and greet, you know I have a very strong background in development. We are currently working to get the team, the process and tools in place to really jump-start growth, but it\u2019s going to take some time. You\u2019re aware, developing a strong new unit pipeline takes anywhere from 18 to 24 months.",
         "Looking overall at the business, we are feeling bullish about our current trajectory, especially in light of our strong performance at this time last year and continued momentum into the fourth quarter.",
         "Before turning over the call to Lance, I\u2019d like to take a moment to address his departure. As I mentioned in the release, it certainly has been a pleasure working together, although a very short time. But I\u2019d like to thank Lance for his many contributions and leadership to the company, strengthening our financial position and managing cash well through the pandemic.",
         "On behalf of the leadership team, you will be missed and we wish you the best of luck in your new opportunity. We feel confident in Dawn and Sean in the meantime. And while we have already initiated the search for Lance\u2019s replacement, just know, given the strength of the finance team, we will be prioritizing finding the right person over filling the position urgently.",
         "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Lance for a closer look at our third quarter results."
      ],
      "Lance Tucker": [
         "Thanks, Darin. And I appreciate the kind words, and good morning, everyone. Operating EPS for the third quarter was $1.37 as compared with $1.07 last year. The roughly 25% increase was primarily driven by strong sales results across the system coupled with lower G&A costs in the quarter.",
         "Our system-wide comparable sales increased 6.6% in the third quarter, company comp sales increased 4.1%, comprised of check increases of 20.2% and transaction declines of just over 16%. Franchise comp sales increased 6.9% for the quarter.",
         "Similar to last quarter, sales results continue to be strong across our system with all regions positive in the third quarter. The difference between company and franchise same-store sales was primarily driven by a few company-owned locations that are heavily dependent upon dine-in traffic. Those locations had a drag of just over 1 percentage point on overall company same-store sales. As mentioned in yesterday\u2019s release, for the four weeks ending August 2, the strong trends we experienced at the end of Q3 have continued to this point in Q4.",
         "During the third quarter, company restaurant-level margin decreased to 25.4%, down from 27% last year. Nearly one point of this decline was driven by labor with wage inflation between 6% and 7% in the quarter and the addition of our emergency paid sick leave program, which added roughly 30 basis points.",
         "Occupancy and other costs were also up nearly 1%, driven primarily by delivery cost increases in COVID-19 related supplies. Food and packaging costs decreased 20 basis points during the quarter, driven by a favorable mix shift, as more purchases of premium items increased our average check. Commodity inflation in the quarter was approximately 3.6%.",
         "Franchise-level margin increased $5.4 million when compared with the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the increase in franchise same-store sales. As a percent of total franchise revenues, franchise-level margin for the quarter was 41.5%. Without the changes from the new lease accounting standard, franchise-level margin would have been 44.4%, a 2% increase versus 42.4% in the prior year.",
         "Advertising costs, which are included in SG&A, were $3.9 million in the third quarter compared with $4 million in the prior year. This slight decrease was due to the reduction in marketing fees for the last couple of weeks of April, which fell within the third quarter. Marketing fees for the fourth quarter remain at the traditional 5% of sales.",
         "G&A decreased $10.6 million in the quarter, as last year\u2019s G&A was inflated by $7 million due to a legal settlement. As a reminder, this settlement accrual was reversed in the fourth quarter of last year. Mark-to-market adjustments related to company-owned life insurance policies, or COLI policies as we refer to them, also drove a favorable $2.6 million reduction in G&A versus the prior year. As we\u2019ve discussed, these policies are sensitive to swings in the stock market. These COLI gains are nontaxable, which, in combination with an improvement in earnings before interest and taxes \u2013 before income taxes rather, drove our tax rate in the third quarter to 27.9%.",
         "Now to turn to our liquidity and debt. Like many in our industry, we have seen business performance change significantly. While our performance has certainly held up relatively well, given the uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of the financial impacts caused by the pandemic, we continue to believe it is prudent to take actions that will maintain and bolster our healthy liquidity position.",
         "To provide a quick update on cash, the company ended the third quarter with roughly $197 million in cash on the balance sheet, of which $160 million was unrestricted. We temporarily paused our share repurchase program and have $122 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. We do not expect to repurchase any shares for the remainder of the fiscal year. We do, however, remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. As we assessed our cash position for the quarter, we have decided to reinstate the quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. We will continue to revisit and monitor our capital allocation policies each quarter as we gain further clarity around the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "Our leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was just over 5x. We continue to be in a strong position when looking at the covenants associated with our debt structure as well.",
         "Lastly, we have scaled back capital spending for the year and are spending only on essential projects at this time. To put some color around this, you can think of it as approximately half of what we were planning to spend for the full year initially.",
         "That concludes our prepared remarks. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. So Stephanie, we\u2019ll turn it back to you."

A replay of the call will be available on the Jack in the Box corporate website starting today. [Operator Instructions]",
         "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Webb, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Analysis for Jack in the Box. Please go ahead."

         "Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Darin Harris; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Lance Tucker.",
         "In our comments this morning, per share amounts refer to diluted earnings per share. We will refer to non-GAAP items throughout today\u2019s call, including operating earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA as well as restaurant-level margin and franchise-level margin. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations provided in yesterday\u2019s earnings release.",
         "Following today\u2019s presentation, we will take questions from the financial community. Please be advised that during the course of our presentation and our question-and-answer session today, we may make forward-looking statements that reflect management\u2019s expectations for the future, which are based on current information. And while management will provide current thinking on this call around the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business, given the unprecedented nature of this pandemic and the rapidly changing environment, any forward-looking statements should be considered with this elevated level of uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations based on risks to the business.",
         "The safe harbor statement in yesterday\u2019s news release and the cautionary statement in the company\u2019s most recent Form 10-K are considered a part of this conference call. Material risk factors as well as information relating to company operations are detailed in our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and other public documents filed with the SEC. These documents are available on the Investors section of our website at www.jackinthebox.com.",
         "Our fourth quarter ends on Sunday, September 27. We tentatively plan to announce results on Wednesday, November 18, after market close. Our conference call is tentatively scheduled to be at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time on Thursday, November 19.",
         "With that, I will turn the call over to Darin."

            "Thanks for the question. Darin, it feels like you could be a change agent for Jack in the Box as it relates to unit growth over the long term. That\u2019s what I felt like in the meet and greet, and that\u2019s what it feels like today. And I\u2019m just curious, what do you believe is really needed to crack the code on getting the brand to open units outside of its regional core markets where most of the units are clustered? It seems like the company has never really cracked that code. And I\u2019m wondering, after 6 weeks, if you have any thoughts?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Brian, I appreciate that comment. And my thoughts, I\u2019ve have had a chance to lean into the business somewhat, is really understanding what drives our success. So part of that is making sure that we have the people, the process and the tools to focus on growing the brand. Understanding what\u2019s driving our consumer behavior is another component that we will continue to focus on so that we can make sure we\u2019re entering the right markets with the right economic model and the right box.",
            "So what I would suggest is that as we look at, whether it\u2019s our existing markets where we have plenty of room to grow or new, it\u2019s really understanding our consumer behavior, what demographics are important and then making sure that we have the flexibility in what type of units that we open or the prototype, in essence, kit-of-parts, so whether it\u2019s in-line, in-cap, whether it\u2019s nontraditional, we need to be able to meet consumers where they want to experience Jack in the Box."

And we haven\u2019t disclosed cash flow for our franchisees. As you are aware, we\u2019ve provided relief and many of our franchises were able to get PPP loans. Overall, what I would say is many of them have decided not to defer rent payments and have paid early on some of those adjustments that we made or the relief that we provided."

I\u2019ve had a chance to spend time with over 65 of them \u2013 or 65% of the system. So it\u2019s been a great opportunity to just connect and get to know some of what\u2019s on their mind.",
            "What I would tell you is the biggest thing they\u2019re looking for from us is the ability to have a seat at the table and really be engaged in how we think about the path forward with the business. So really, the ability to provide feedback for us to listen, for us to engage and get their input on initiatives we\u2019re rolling out because a lot of times, they have great ideas on how they can make us better. And so we want to make sure that we take the opportunity to engage them in all the right areas of our business that will just enhance the strategies that we put in place."

Darin, wondering if you could talk a bit more about your impressions around both the new product pipeline, the strategy which seemingly has resonated very well in the recent quarters, as well as just kind of the overall value strategy, any kind of updates that you see going forward, anything as it relates to value and new products, any kind of tweaks that you see depending on the pressure that consumers are coming under over the coming quarters? Just kind of on that strategy and whether anything needs to change or how confident you are that this is kind of the right strategy to drive continued momentum for the business in coming quarters and going forward?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Dennis Geiger"
      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Great question. So let me talk about value first in the value strategy of Jack and how I think we can set ourselves up for success, if we see our competitors lean into price-pointed offers as an example. Over the past couple of years, the team has really been working on getting the approach to value right. We focused on these $4.99 bundles that the product team has created to help insulate our margin as well as drive transactions in this environment. Some of our successful add-ons at a $3 price point can also mean different types of value for different consumers.",
            "So while the vast majority of our customers add these onto their checks, many want a $3 meal of Tiny Tacos, and they can have those as well. So to me, for the value piece, it\u2019s really meeting our consumer\u2019s desire to value, what they get for what they pay. And we\u2019ll continue to focus on innovation around doing that, whether it\u2019s upsells, whether it\u2019s unique snackable items that they can treat as their main entr\u00e9e or whether it\u2019s indulgent items like our Buttery Jack or our homestyle chicken. We want to give consumers what they desire from Jack at any time of the day."

            "Great. And then if I could just add a quick follow-up, just around the discussions that you mentioned with franchisees. Can you just describe kind of the demand for growth? Does it seem to be there? I know that pipeline will take a time to build. But does there seem to be a strong interest in demand for new units based on the conversations you\u2019ve had to date?"

            "Yes, great question. What I would tell you is that from my discussions with our franchise system, what I found is that they\u2019re eager to grow. They want to grow. Now what I would say we need to do in order to accelerate that is give them the tools, provide the correct processes to really enhance their desire to grow. So like I mentioned earlier, kit-of-parts, being able to go to many different locations with the Jack brand, giving them the tools to find real estate more rapidly. And then more than anything, focus on the unit economic model and getting the right-sized box for them to build in that markets."

Is this \u2013 is there \u2013 I know you said all regions are positive, but is there a regional SKU? You talked about, I think, breakfast daypart contributing, which is a bit surprising to me. Is there anything that you see other than we\u2019ve seen through results of getting better? And obviously, you\u2019ve got some product news that\u2019s in the market. But is there any sort of granularity you can provide about why you\u2019re so much ahead of a lot of your peers right now on a comp basis?"

So first of all, from a regional standpoint, we\u2019re not going to share specifics by region, but just know in areas where places have started to reopen, we really haven\u2019t seen degradation. And as Lance mentioned, we continue to see strength across regions.",
            "In terms of the daypart trends, as we\u2019ve seen transactions really drive our improvement throughout the third quarter, we\u2019ve seen that across dayparts.

But as you rekindle development, sometimes companies like to lead with company stores to sort of prove the economics or prove the new model. Do you see any change in how you think about the company franchise? Or are you thinking about maybe leading development in the system more aggressively to underscore your confidence in the model? Or do you see it not changing?"

But we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that into our \u2013 both our short-term and long-term strategy. In essence, will the company grow units alongside franchisees?

            "Thank you very much for the question. Just maybe on the margin. I guess I would think that the company store margins are probably not a great proxy for franchise margins because of the regional SKU and also the comp difference. Can you maybe help just at least frame up if the franchise margins are kind of up on the current comps and \u2013 given kind of how much of the business is going through the drive-thru?",
            "And then a follow-up would be, does, I guess, how much is going through the drive-through change your plans for what the assets are going to look like on a go-forward basis in terms of the store design and the percent of the dining room, square footage or anything like that?"

            "Greg, thanks for the question. I\u2019m going to answer your first question and then pitch it over to Darin on your second question. But I think you\u2019re right in terms of company being a little more outsized in terms of margin impact, first, based on our largely California footprint. Like you mentioned, we should see some benefit from the dining rooms being largely closed across the system. But company, in particular, kept our staffing the entire time with no reduction in hours. We could have layered on that emergency sick leave program also. So a couple of things that I would say are a little bit unique for company compared to franchise results. And given the sales performance, we would expect them to be a little bit \u2013 in a little bit stronger position from a margin standpoint. I will kick it over to Darin for the unit piece."

As we think about how we evaluate the current economic model on the box as it relates to off-premise, clearly, we\u2019re learning some things through the pandemic and one is we have to continue to focus on how do we create this incredible guest experience through our drive-thru or any off-premise occasion. And so we\u2019re definitely going to take some of the opportunity into our future strategy to evaluate that.",

Now it seems like all the restaurants that are reporting tend to talk about despite a horrible situation that there has been some silver linings in the industry, whether it\u2019s technology adoption or drive-thru usage, real estate availability, speed of service, lots of potential positives. I\u2019m just wondering maybe what trends have you seen change over the past few months in the underlying business? And maybe what would you do differently going forward to maybe further accelerate the change that you\u2019ve seen? Maybe what are the biggest areas of opportunity? And then I had one follow-up."

I think it\u2019s just accelerated and now we have to amplify how we pay attention to it and how we still give the guest the best experience we can, whether it\u2019s through delivery or whether it\u2019s through the drive-thru.",

You talked about, in the press release, momentum through June or that it accelerated, I guess, through the third quarter and based on the fact that we had already had some tidbits of information earlier in the quarter, it does seem like perhaps you ended the quarter in a low double-digit range. And then there\u2019s mention that the acceleration continued thus far into the fourth quarter. So just trying to interpret when you say the acceleration continued, does that mean that trends have further improved? Or are you just happy to say that the momentum you had in the third quarter has sustained at the same level, just \u2013 because we did have so much granularity through the fiscal third quarter, just trying to get a sense for what the implication was thus far in the fiscal fourth quarter?"

But beyond that, what I would say, to answer your question specifically, Jack has tools. I don\u2019t want to mislead anybody. What I\u2019m talking about is seeing how we can upgrade those and take it to another level. For example, multiple different unit economic models and multiple different ways to open locations, whether it\u2019s travel centers to in-line units to in-cap units and freestanding. We need to figure out \u2013 even if it\u2019s conversions in this environment, we\u2019re taking advantage of some of the real estate opportunities that may exist. We have to continue to develop our process and systems to adjust and be more agile and adapt rapidly. So that\u2019s more where I\u2019m referring to. And then just continuing to find ways to value engineer our new development box or basically our unit economic model. And so that\u2019s really what I\u2019m talking about, making sure that we have continuing to make our tools, our prototype and everything more efficient and effective to be prepared for more aggressive growth."

So those are the areas that we will be continuing to roll out through the back half of the year that I think will enhance.

So I was just wondering the typical pipeline being 18 to 24 months out, is this a time where you maybe consider trying to rush that along and either get to the front end of that 18 to 24 months or perhaps inside of that such that you can take advantage of the real estate opportunities in the marketplace?"

So really diving deep into data around our guests and segmentation work, I think, is where it starts, and then creating a robust process internally that engages our franchisees because they have great ideas and their employees have great ideas, our vendors. And then our \u2013 also aligning with some third-party providers who think about this 24/7. And then the last piece is really getting our entire company, especially the product development team, excited around how they can find unique ways to give our guests what they want. So I think that\u2019s really our focus. Up until recently, and as Rachel said, we\u2019ve had a really robust pipeline of products.

What do you view as the key unlock to increasing Jack\u2019s digital presence? Is it the store prototype going forward and making it more accessible?

But as we mentioned, all five dayparts are contributing positively by the end of the third quarter.

We see sales sum here as well as margins, cash flow, solid, and it looks like it\u2019s improving. So what is the trigger before you get more aggressive and move to your prior stance of pretty significant return of cash to shareholders? Is it really just a resolution of the COVID crisis?

There\u2019s not some financial metric that\u2019s going to say, okay, now\u2019s the day to turn back on share repurchases. I would tell you a couple of things. I think the biggest overall driver of when the company is going to choose to do that is just having a comfortable feel and outlook for what\u2019s coming next. And so just as we continue to get smarter around being able to predict what\u2019s going to happen as we continue to see what\u2019s happening not only in the industry but certainly just with the public health crisis, then those are the things that we\u2019ll take into consideration as we decide we\u2019re comfortable to go ahead and reinstate that share repurchase program. Obviously, just let me reemphasize the cash return to shareholders is a big part of our model. It\u2019s why we went ahead and turned the dividend back on this quarter.

What\u2019s the best way to be thinking about G&A as we move forward?"

            "This is Lance. I\u2019ll take that one as well. So there have been some ups and downs, as you mentioned, as Rachel and I have called out in some of these calls. I think the way to think about it, we have consistently said we believe we\u2019re going to be in the neighborhood of 1.7%, 1.8% of system sales. And that kind of typically excludes some of the COLI stuff as well as any big onetime items. So as I\u2019m thinking about it from the dollars perspective, I would think the same guidance we\u2019ve given previously around being somewhat under 2% of overall system sales. That 1.8% kind of measure isn\u2019t a bad one to think about. And then just know it\u2019s going to be impacted on a quarter-to-quarter basis as COVID moves around or if we have a significant onetime event."

And then as a follow-up, it relates to several questions that have already been asked during the call, but what would you see as the top one to two drivers of this really pretty dramatic same-store sales improvement that Jack has delivered over the last several months? What\u2019s moved the needle the most? What surprised you the most in terms of everything you have going on, on the \u2013 either product innovation or marketing front? What\u2019s moved the needle the most for you guys?"

That\u2019s been going on even before the pandemic. That value equation that is a combination of the bundles at a competitive price point as well as the add-ons and upsells, continuing to innovate on products guests crave and then starting to improve and focus around our operations and operational excellence."

            "Thank you. Darin, congratulations on your new role. I guess with respect to kind of your vision of what the Jack brand represents 6, 7 years ago, it was pretty \u2013 it was relatively clear that of the premium brand going after a core customer of 16 to 25-year-old males. I mean you mentioned your reference of the brand, it kind of toned down a bit to maybe expand with the core customer was about 4 or 5 years ago. What\u2019s your assessment of that going forward? And also, the premium positioning 3 years ago, the bundle value resulted arguably in share losses. And it seems like going forward, the bundle value remains the focus. And so what\u2019s \u2013 I guess, what\u2019s different now versus 3 years ago? What\u2019s the position of the brand with respect to premium versus value? And who\u2019s your core customer? What\u2019s your take on that going forward?"

            "Yes. What I would say is that I\u2019m still in the learning phase about our customer. And so one thing that I do focus on and will focus on with Jack is that we really need to understand why they come to us and why do they leave, and \u2013 so that we can focus on capturing at least one more visit and frequency from our core. And so that\u2019s more of how I think about it versus starting with how do we create kind of our ambition for other customers.",
            "So focus on our core, make sure that we can get them coming back more frequently. But as you know, we\u2019ve done a lot of this through variety, making sure that we have something for everyone at every daypart. So that\u2019s one of the key things that I think we\u2019ll continue to focus on and then that value equation and giving people different price options to help them feel what, in their terms, is value.",
            "And then the last I would say is the industry is somewhat different from years ago. And it\u2019s become definitely \u2013 it\u2019s always been competitive, but it\u2019s become even more competitive recently."

            "This is Lance. I\u2019m going to jump in and add one thing here, just to give a little bit of historical context. Three or four years ago, we were, in many ways, not necessarily participating in value as much. Some of that was by choice, I think. Decisions made over the last, let\u2019s call it, 18 months, where we\u2019ve really focused on upsells. As Darin mentioned, we\u2019ve done a nice job of making sure we have items that can serve both as a meal or an add-on at a very competitive price, gives us some tools that we didn\u2019t have a few years ago when we did, in fact, lose a little bit of share. So I think the balance of how we\u2019re doing our value versus our premium items is \u2013 makes a little more sense now than perhaps it did then."
