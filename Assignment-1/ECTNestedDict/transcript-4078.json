         "Thank you, Paul. Turning now to our second quarter financial results. Revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $859,000, which is down only 2% from the second quarter of 2019 and reflects the fact that for much of the quarter, we were unable to deliver any MyoPros, owing to the shutdowns necessitated by the Coronavirus pandemic.",
         "Our higher average selling price mostly offset a lower number of revenue units, with a significant increase in ASP, reflecting success with our direct billing channel. There were 24 revenue units in the second quarter.",
         "More specifically, revenue from direct billing for the second quarter was 50% of total revenue and this was up 329% compared with the direct billing revenue in the prior year quarter. We\u2019re very happy with our success in driving direct billing revenue growth.",
         "Our backlog of units, which represents insurance authorizations received, but not yet converted to revenue was 120 units as of June 30, 2020. This is up over -- up 50% over 80 units as of March 31, 2020.",
         "Approximately 20% of the March 31, 2020 unit backlog was converted into revenue during the second quarter, a lower percentage than in previous quarters, owing to suspended deliveries as a result of COVID-19. Approximately 70% of the Q2 ending backlog is comprised of direct billing units.",
         "Gross Margin for the second quarter was 51%, down from 57% in the prior year second quarter. The decrease primarily reflects costs of revenues recognized on deliveries toward the end of the second quarter, which are expected to be recognized as revenues in future periods, as well as increased warranty reserves. Note that cost of revenues now included certain fixed costs, such as our quality organization that were recorded in R&D in prior periods. Prior year gross margin reflects these costs.",
         "Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were $3.3 million, a modest 3% increase over the second quarter of 2019 and a 20% decline compared with the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase reflects a full quarter of compensation costs, primarily associated with the addition of reimbursement personnel in the prior year period and higher legal expenses, offset by payroll and other reductions in sales, clinical and marketing expenses in response to COVID-19. With certain geographies reopening, we expect operating expenses will increase in the third quarter, as we selectively add back professionals in order to fulfill our growing patient backlog.",
         "Our operating loss for the second quarter of 2020 increased slightly to $2.8 million from $2.7 million for the second quarter of 2019. Net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was $3.3 million or $1.12 per share and this compares with a net loss of $2.6 million or $4.50 per share for the same period of 2019.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was a negative $2.7 million, compared with a negative $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2019. Please refer to the table in today\u2019s press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.",
         "Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2020 were $10.7 million. We utilized $3.7 million of cash in the second quarter. This was somewhat higher than prior quarters due to higher cash used for working capital as you cash inflows slowed as a result of the impact of COVID-19, while liabilities were paid down.",
         "During the quarter, we utilized our ATM facility generating net proceeds of around $700,000 through the issuance of approximately 180,000 shares of common stock at a weighted average sales price of $3.87 [ph] per share.",
         "Cash utilization in the third quarter is expected to be at the low end of the usual custom -- of the usual quarterly range of $2.4 million to $3 million, excluding any ATM proceeds. So long as public health and travel restrictions are not re-imposed due to the spread of COVID-19, we believe that we have sufficient cash to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, if public health and travel restrictions are re-imposed, we may require additional capital to fund operations during the second half of 2021.",
         "During the second quarter, we amended our term loan with Chicago Venture Partners, turning it into a convertible note that allows us to repay the note in cash or stock at our option. The amendment included a restructuring fee of $105,000, which was added to the outstanding balance.",
         "During the second quarter redemptions by CVP of $800,000 were paid by issuing approximately 224,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $3.58 per share. As of June 30, 2020, the outstanding balance of the note, including the restructuring fee was approximately $1 million. Net loss during the second quarter of 2020, includes a charge of approximately $348,000 for a loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from these redemptions.",
         "Turning briefly to our year-end financial result -- year-to-date financial results, revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $1.9 million, up 9% over the prior year period, despite the impact of COVID-19.",
         "The year-to-date operating and net loss were $6.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively. Net loss for the second quarter and first half of 2020 includes the charges of $500,000, approximately related to the partial extinguishment of the company\u2019s convertible note. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was a negative $6 million, compared with a negative $4.8 million in the same period a year ago.",
         "Turning now to our near-term expectations, while the impact of COVID-19 has altered our outlook, back in the spring, we are optimistic for redemption of significant growth in the second half of the year.",
         "As Paul mentioned, with geographies opening up to economic activity, we are hopeful that Myomo\u2019s operations will continue at least more normal pace for the remainder of the year. We\u2019ve been building an impressive authorization backlog, which we are working to convert into revenue in subsequent periods.",
         "This majority of our backlog is direct billing patients, the extent to which we can accelerate revenue growth in the third quarter will depend on, first, the continued ability to deliver MyoPros to patients which we control, and second, obtaining reimbursement from insurers in a timely manner, which we don\u2019t control.",
         "Because we don\u2019t control the timing of insurance payments, it\u2019s difficult to guide to our forecasted revenue. However, we are forecasting a record number of deliveries in the third quarter. This means that we have an opportunity to generate record revenues in the third quarter, depending on the timing of payments by insurers.",
         "Longer term, the MyoPro opportunity remains significant. We believe we are putting in place all the necessary components to accelerate revenue growth and margin expansion as a country gets fully back to work.",
         "With that overview, I will turn the call over to Paul."

         "Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Kim Golodetz with LHA. Welcome to the Myomo second quarter 2020 financial results conference call.

         "With me on the call today for Myomo are Paul Gudonis, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Henry, Chief Financial Officer.",

         "These and additional risks and uncertainties and other factors are discussed in the risk factors and other qualifications contained in Myomo\u2019s filings with the Securities Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, which was filed earlier this afternoon.",

         "Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to the Myomo Incorporated Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]",
         "Please also note today\u2019s event is being recorded. And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference call over to Kim Golodetz. Please go ahead."
      ],
      "Paul Gudonis": [
         "Thank you, Kim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. After I present a business update, Dave will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our financial outlook and following the financial update, I\u2019ll give some closing remarks and then we\u2019ll take your questions.",
         "But first I hope that you, your families and your colleagues are all well during this pandemic. COVID-19 has affected everyone and the full impact on our way of life and our businesses is still unknown.",
         "Over the past several months, we\u2019ve taken actions to adjust Myomo\u2019s operations and have dealt well with the initial restrictions on travel and person-to-person activity, and we\u2019ve been safely providing our powered arm braces as states opened up.",
         "Our revenues for the second quarter of 2020 were $859,000, which was significantly better than what we had expected at the beginning of the quarter, due to the uncertainties related to COVID-19. This level of revenue was barely down just 2% from our revenues in the year ago quarter, and year-to-date, our revenues are up nearly 10% over the same period last year. So we\u2019ve been able to grow our business despite the short-term impact of the Coronavirus.",
         "Direct billing of our products to payers in the second quarter increased by 329% year-over-year and represented 50% of revenues in the quarter. The other half of our revenues came primarily from our U.S. O&P channel partners, the VA and Europe.",
         "And with over 85% of our new MyoPro candidates entering the pipeline as direct billing cases, we have successfully made the transition from a wholesale medical device manufacturer to a B2C direct-to-patient provider, resulting in higher revenue per unit compared to a year ago, as well as more control over the process from regeneration to delivery.",
         "We also increase the size of our backlog, which is defined as MyoPros that have been authorized by payers, but are either in the process of being delivered to users or awaiting payments to us. Our backlog stood at 120 units at the end of Q2, up 50% from the 80 units at the start of the quarter.",
         "Last year, we started screening patients via telehealth video conferencing, to assess them as a MyoPro candidate and to move them forward into the pipeline for reimbursement and future fittings. Despite the travel restrictions and the social distancing measures that have been put in place, we\u2019ve continue to build the front end of our pipeline by remote screening for MyoPro conducted within the guidelines of the telehealth protocol.",
         "It\u2019s safer for the candidate since they can be screened at home. Our field staff is safe and can be much more productive in terms of the number of screens they can conduct per day and we save the time and expense associated with travel to perform these screenings.",
         "Our success is reflected in the numbers. During the second quarter, we added approximately 200 new MyoPro candidates to the reimbursement pipeline, which continues to stand at about 8,700 units, adjusting for new authorizations received and for the churn due to final denials by insurance, changes in the patient\u2019s condition or change in their insurance or for other reasons. Since the start of the year, we\u2019ve added about 500 new candidates to the pipeline through direct-to-patient online marketing and referrals from clinicians.",
         "As States began opening up in May and June, we restarted in-person deliveries in MyoPro fittings and now have accelerated that pace of deliveries into July and August, as we are moving forward to monetize the backlog.",
         "In July, we delivered more than 40 devices and have -- already have more than 20 scheduled for August. By comparison, we\u2019ve recognized revenue on 54 units so far this year. That means in July and so far in August, we expect that we will deliver more units than we recognize revenue on in the first six months of the year. We expect that these recent deliveries will convert to revenue as payments are received in the coming months.",
         "We instituted a new patient interaction policy as a result of COVID-19 and have been able to procure a supply of personal protective equipment in order to keep both our employees and our patients\u2019 safe, as we resumed patient visits or public health as restrictions are being eased.",
         "As I discussed on our last earnings call, starting in March, we took a number of steps to reduce operating expenses and cash utilization. As a result of these personnel actions and other cost reductions, operating expenses decreased sequentially by approximately $800,000.",
         "Now that we\u2019re increasing deliveries, we are bringing back some staff members and expect travel expenses to return to more normal levels in order to provide the MyoPros to patients, so we anticipate our operating expenses will increase in the third quarter in order to generate growth in revenues from our growing backlog.",
         "Meanwhile, the number of MyoPros being authorized by insurance companies is growing, especially among patients covered by Medicare Advantage plans and other commercial payers who are regularly reimbursing the cost in MyoPro.",
         "For seniors on Part D Medicare, we\u2019ve been informed that coverage for MyoPro will be determined on a case-by-case basis upon the medical necessity and we\u2019re still waiting for the first device to be approved from claims submitted by one of our O&P channel partners.",
         "Although, we are meeting with adult candidates in person for MyoPro fittings, we\u2019ve refrained from in-person meetings with children and their families to complete the pediatric MyoPro device testing. So as I mentioned last quarter, we pushed out the national launch of that product to next year. This will save us additional cash this year and enable us to focus our resources on the adult MyoPro population.",
         "With that overview of our results and how we\u2019ve adapted to the COVID-19 situation, we\u2019ll move on to the financial review of the 2020 second quarter by our CFO, Dave Henry. Dave?",
         "Thanks, Dave. While as you heard us described today over the past five months, we quickly adjusted our business in response to the change personal health and economic environments, we added to our patient pipeline, we continue to do so more cost effectively with our telehealth approach and we expect to see an even larger percentage of our business going through the direct billing channel, which leads to higher revenue and gross margin per unit. While we had a short delay in deliveries during the quarter, we\u2019re moving aggressively to catch up with a large number of shipments from our growing backlog.",
         "Starting in July, we also increased our digital marketing activity and we\u2019re seeing a higher number of patient inquiries as the front-end of our pipeline continues to grow. This growth in the number of candidates considering a MyoPro is a leading indicator of future revenues as we continue on the path toward cash flow breakeven.",
         "This concludes the formal part of our presentation. So, Operator, we\u2019re ready to open the call to questions."

            "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and thanks for all the details here. You talked a little bit about the growing pipeline, I mean, it\u2019s growing -- the backlog growing 50% and how July and August make up more than all of the first half of the year. Just for clarification, I didn\u2019t quite catch it. Were you talking about sales or backlog? Just kind of wondering if you said Q3 sales could actually be higher than all of the first half?"

      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, we booked revenue on 54 units in the first half of the year, in the first six months. And then our shipments in July and August, together, totaled over 60 units and those will convert into revenue as we receive payments from the insurance payers."

            "So what I mentioned in my remarks, Kyle was that, given that we have a record number of deliveries, but we don\u2019t control the timing of insurance payments, I said, there was an opportunity for record revenues in the third quarter. The previous record revenue for the company was $1.5 million back I think Q4 of last year.",
            "So that\u2019s the opportunity we have. We\u2019re doing what we can to try to grow the revenues as quickly as possible. But we don\u2019t control the timing of insurance payments, which under direct billing is really the criteria that we\u2019re beholden to in order to be able to record revenue."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I mean either way it\u2019s pretty exciting to already have shipped 60 units and that\u2019s just the first two months of the quarter, you still have September, so really nice to see that update there. Shifting to direct billing, so this has been a really nice way to be able to kind of control the process and keep really nice way to be able to kind of control the process and keeping patients in the pipeline and generating better returns. I\u2019m just kind of curious if a patient drops out from the time that they are going through this process. What are some of the key reasons for that and how is this dropout rate changed over maybe the past year or so?"

         "Speaker": "Kyle Bauser"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So a patient might drop out of the pipeline for a number of reasons. For example, they may have another medical issue, another stroke, for example, and they need to postpone their continuation of the process.",
            "Some people change insurance. Some move, I think, we saw a higher churn than usual in the second quarter due to COVID, where people might have been come more hesitant about proceeding in the process. Some people or their spouses might have gone on unemployment, which might have reduced their ability to move forward here.",
            "So, fortunately, we were able to continue our online digital marketing, people were, obviously, sheltering in place, going to Facebook, going on Google, still searching for solutions. So we\u2019re able to replace that churn pipeline with new patients coming into the process."

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. Got it. And regarding the Medicare opportunity, I know we\u2019re waiting for this to eventually be material, but do you think that the device compliance rate and maybe even value proposition is higher in the younger patient population anyways or no, I mean, I know this is an opportunity that\u2019s coming, but just kind of wondering if maybe the higher value proposition opportunities is already activated?"

         "Remarks": [
            "While we got the HCPCS codes issued back in January of 2019 that enabled Medicare Advantage plans to start paying for the device. And Medicare Advantage covers about 35% of seniors.",
            "We believe the value proposition for them is to live more safely at home and reduce the potential healthcare costs, for example, stroke survivors tend to fall more often, because with their hemiparesis they often have issues with an arm and a leg, so if they were carrying something, they might trip, fall and that results in head trauma, perhaps, some type of other injury. They\u2019ve had to go readmitted to the hospital.",
            "So there\u2019s those type of savings or maybe also savings and reduction in pain medications, other reductions, for example, in Botox usage for spasticity. So these are the types of reported savings we\u2019ve heard from patients.",
            "For the younger patients, because they are still able to work or of working age, they may be able to go back into the workforce. So, certainly, there\u2019s a strong value proposition for them. Now I got a -- I look at one of our patient leads that came in the other day with a young mother, who had high blood pressure during her delivery, resulted in a stroke and left her with one side affected and she wants to be able to use both arms to interact and care for her children. So there\u2019s a slightly different value proposition for those younger patients."

I did have a couple questions, when I think about kind of the revenue model and what to do with all the leading indicators. The first one is, pipeline adds strong this quarter at 200, even stronger first quarter at 300, yeah, which one of those numbers do you think is more reflective of what we should expect going forward or is it somewhere between 200 and 300 a quarter?"

We also reduced our advertising spending to focus it where we had regional clinical staff. So we cut back on our ad spending and that reduced the number of leads coming in.",
            "In July, we -- reinstitute coming in. In July we reinstituted that and we\u2019ve seen a strong pickup in leads in already in the first part of the third quarter here. So I think the first quarter is probably more reflective of what we expect going forward."

I guess, first question is, how many of those do you think are from activity in Q1 or is it more from Q2? And second, historically, how much -- historically, what percent of those devices would get paid for in I guess Q3?"

Our backlog typically unless if there\u2019s -- unless there\u2019s issues with the particular claim and we do have some claims that have issues. But typically it\u2019s once something is in backlog, it\u2019s three months to six months in order for it to get paid.",

So far here in the third quarter came from backlog that was in existence in the first quarter versus the second quarter. But I can tell you that it\u2019s generally three months to six months before backlog actually turns into revenue somewhere in that timeframe in that."

Now, obviously, some of those adds become sales. But what percent of the backlog is dropping out typically?"

            "So, as a -- so in periods where revenue was low, we\u2019re going to have a lower gross margin because of those fixed costs and cost of goods sold, call it, fixed overhead, whatever you want to call it. Then -- but as revenue goes up, your gross margin will increase, because the contribution margin will be higher. Those fixed costs aren\u2019t going to increase.",
            "The other phenomena is that, in second quarter, because we were -- we had a lot of deliveries at the end of the quarter, as we started to open things up again, recall what our revenue recognition that, we don\u2019t take -- for under direct billing, we don\u2019t take revenue until we meet all the conditions for revenue recognition and more often than not that coincides with payment and so but we\u2019re still required to record the cost of revenues when we ship, when the inventory of these are balance sheet."

So I mean, if you didn\u2019t ship another unit for the rest of the year or if you just collected on the 78 units that you have out right now, you would expect to book about $2.25 million and $3.25 million, but $2.8 million in revenue.
