         "Thank you, Steve. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining the Schneider call today.",
         "I will open with a few summary comments on the quarter regarding our operating segments. And then before we get to your questions, I\u2019m going to ask Steve Bruffett just to provide some additional insight on the overall enterprise results, our strong liquidity position and the reintroduction of earnings guidance based upon the best information we have available at this time.",
         "As it relates to the quarter, it was a demanding one, and I\u2019m especially grateful and proud of the resiliency, our associates demonstrated daily, especially our professional drivers. In these highly uncertain and fluid times, our key business priorities are to first safeguard the health and safety of our associates, and secondly, to adapt after the dynamic freight demand needs of our valued customer community.",
         "At Schneider, we have nearly 19,000 associates and owner-operators across the globe, and nearly 4 out of 5 of them must report to work daily to fulfill our promises to customers. They are drivers, shop, warehouse and driver services professionals, and they continue to shine in keeping goods flowing across the nation\u2019s supply chain.",
         "The impacts of COVID-19 in our daily work lives are pronounced. Since the onset of the pandemic, we\u2019ve had over 100 associates who have experienced a confirmed COVID diagnosis. Fortunately, all of them have recovered or in the process of recovering from the effects. We have supported another 800 associates or so who have gone through monitoring protocols due to a potential exposure. For those in roles that cannot work remotely, that support at times includes emergency paid leave and other benefit-driven relief to ensure we are doing our best to eliminate community spread of the virus. To safeguard our associates, we have adjusted our deep cleaning protocols, provide disinfectant supplies and facemask, among other measures, at approximately an incremental $1 million of expense per month.",
         "As it relates to the economic recovery of freight markets, it\u2019s been uneven across our various service lines. The Intermodal segment has been impacted the most due to a combination of higher business mix of \"non-essential shippers\" and a reduced level of Asian sourced import activity. While volumes did improve throughout the quarter, in total, year-over-year Intermodal order count contracted 13%. But in addition to the volume reductions, the disruption to the network in terms of load balance, increased empty repositioning movements and rail purchase transportation costs led to a disappointingly low operating margin for the quarter of 5%.",
         "Now the most recent quarter does not change our long-term operating margin target expectation for Intermodal, that remains in the 10% to 12% range. And assuming we avoid another economic shock, the work done in the second quarter by our Intermodal sales and operations team, working in concert with our customers and rail partners, is expected to result in a material improvement towards our targeted range in the third quarter of 2020. Improved order volumes and balance will contribute to that rebound in performance, and we are certainly seeing the benefit of that body of work already here in the month of July.",
         "And one more note on our Intermodal segment. Our published Intermodal metrics indicate our total trailer count -- or container count, excuse me, finished the quarter at approximately 21,200. And that number is roughly 600 units lower than we projected during our last earnings call. I just want to highlight that, that number is largely just a timing nuance between when end-of-life containers were pulled out of service and when our new containers are placed into service. And we expect that difference to largely be resolved as we operate through the remainder of 2020.",
         "Our truckload liquid bulk tanker service also was disproportionately impacted in the quarter as its end cap market customers in the industrial and energy market experienced a mid-teen percentage drop in business volumes starting in April. Bulk tank network business volumes improved throughout the quarter, and delayed bulk dedicated start-ups became operational very late in the second quarter. The positive upward trend continues so far in the month of July, and bulk generally serves as a leading indicator for dry van truckload business volumes.",
         "Speaking of dry van, overall, our business volumes and build customer miles rebounded the fastest across our network and dedicated truckload business. I think last quarter, we indicated we had about 445 dedicated units that have been displaced due to temporary customer shutdown activity. As the quarter closed, all of those accounts have become operational again, although several with less units than pre-COVID levels. And in addition, several new business start-ups that were delayed became operational late in the quarter. Again, assuming no market setbacks, we would expect that in the third quarter of \u201820, we will rise above pre-COVID and year-over-year volume comparators in our core truckload segment. Our focus in the second half will be on improving the network freight basket from a yield standpoint as contractual pricing through the second quarter is down low single-digit percentages year-over-year. ",
         "Now daily network freight tenders now are far exceeding our acceptance levels. And spot pricing has spiked throughout the quarter, it is now double-digit percentages above contract levels.",
         "We also believe capacity levels are likely to tighten further as we head into the second half of the year. New truck orders remained well below industry replacement levels. New driver entrants to the industry, the top of the funnel, if you will, has been materially curtailed as public and private driving schools have responded to the pandemic with closures or certainly with smaller class sizes. And the national drug and alcohol clearinghouse process is now fully implemented.",
         "Finally, our Logistics segment business posted a positive year-over-year growth numbers in terms of order counts and operating revenue. Our brokerage business continues to adapt well to the highly variable market conditions that we experienced throughout the quarter. And brokerage experienced a tightening capacity market as the quarter progressed and the corresponding rise in carrier costing that comes with that. But despite all that volatility, margins improved 180 basis points sequentially from the first quarter.",
         "So in summary, there\u2019s still a high degree of macro uncertainty. But at the same time, our retail, food, beverage and consumer nondurable customers, a large composition of our business mix, are projecting increased volumes through the second half of the year. We are in constructive planning conversations with our customers across our Intermodal and Truckload segments, and we\u2019re seeing this near-term tightening of supply and demand in most geographies across our networks. Furthermore, we believe the driver supply condition actually could tighten further with the pending public policy decisions being debated in Washington presently.",
         "Before we get to your questions, Steve, why don\u2019t you just wrap up the quarter?"

         "Greetings. Welcome to Schneider National\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. ",
         "I will now turn the conference over to your host, Steve Bindas. You may begin."

      "Steve Bindas": [
         "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Mark Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Bruffett, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.",
         "Earlier today, the company issued an earnings press release, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at schneider.com.",
         "Our call will include remarks about future expectations, forecasts, plans and prospects for Schneider, which constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under applicable federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. The company urges investors to review the risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our most recent Form 10-K and those risks identified in today\u2019s earnings release. All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this call, and Schneider disclaims any duty to update such statements, except as required by law.",
         "In addition, pursuant to Regulation G, a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures referenced during today\u2019s call can be found in our earnings release, which includes reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.",
         "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mark Rourke. Mark?"
      ],
      "Steve Bruffett": [
         "Thanks, Mark, and good morning. I\u2019ll provide some perspectives on our enterprise results for the quarter and then give an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Enterprise revenues, excluding fuel surcharge, were down $124 million or 11%. Operating expenses were down in proportion to the revenue decline, and this resulted in adjusted income from operations of $64 million compared to $84 million last year.",
         "Regarding the impact of COVID on our results, included in the second quarter were direct COVID expenses of about $3 million. This includes PPE costs, primarily for our drivers, additional cleaning costs and related items. We expect this level of quarterly expense will continue at least through the remainder of the year. To date, the COVID situation has not had a meaningful impact on our bad debt expense or on our DSO. But we continue to monitor and manage that situation very closely.",
         "Also, the quarter included some reduced cost areas that were largely attributable to COVID. Most notable were health care expenses, which were lower than normal, as elective visits and procedures were largely deferred. And there were driver costs that were lower as retention levels were strong during the quarter. Collectively, these specific COVID cost areas had a nominal impact on our second quarter results. However, the overall impact of COVID, including its impact on volumes and pricing, was clearly negative in the second quarter, especially in our Intermodal segment, as Mark discussed.",
         "Regarding equipment, there was about a $3 million negative year-over-year impact from asset impairment charges and gain/loss on sale. In the second quarter of 2020, the net of these 2 items was $2.9 million of expense while the second quarter of last year was $100,000 of expense. Difficult to say what the used equipment market would have been had COVID not happened, but we believe that it placed additional downward pressure on used tractor prices.",
         "Moving now to our Other segment. On our earnings call in January of this year, I guided to an average quarterly expense of $4 million and indicated that there would likely be variability by quarter. In the first quarter of 2020, there was $2.2 million of expense. And in the second quarter, there was $3.7 million of income. So what drives this level of variability from one quarter to the next? As is typically the case for us, accruals for incentive compensation for our associates not directly in an operating unit are the largest contributor. Less expense was recognized in the second quarter than in the first due to the earnings impact of the COVID environment. Also, a portion of our corporate cost containment efforts showed up as favorable in the Other segment in the second quarter. For the remaining 2 quarters of the year, we now expect an average quarterly expense of $3 million, but again, note that actual results could vary.",
         "In the nonoperating portion of our income statement, both interest expense and interest income were down about $2 million from the second quarter of last year. Interest expense was lower due to the repayment of senior notes and interest income was down due to the sharp drop in short-term rates earlier this year. Also in this section was a second quarter true-up of the mark-to-market gain from our investment in the telematics company, Platform Science. We recognized a $2.7 million gain during the quarter once the valuation work was completed. And this resulted in a total of $8.8 million booked so far this year.",
         "Moving now to the balance sheet. Our cash balance has grown faster in the first half of 2020 than it typically would as due to lower levels of capital expenditures and working capital. In addition, the deferrals of income and payroll taxes under the CARES Act have contributed to the cash balance. We expect a reversal of these items in the second half of 2020 and anticipate being net users of cash during that time frame. ",
         "For context, we have remaining about $180 million of our projected $260 million in net capital expenditures. And with the sequential revenue growth that\u2019s inherent in our EPS guidance, working capital will likely consume cash between now and year-end. In addition, while our cash flows will continue to benefit from the deferral of certain payroll taxes, we will resume the payment of quarterly income tax estimates. We also plan to repay a $30 million note at its maturity in September. As a net result of these items, we expect our year-end cash position to be closer to $700 million than the June 30 level of $761 million.",
         "Regarding our cash position, we know and understand that there are questions about what we intend to do with it. As I\u2019ve stated in the past, we will maintain a conservative balance sheet, yet are actively evaluating various alternatives for excess cash position, and we\u2019ll continue to do so. The deployment of cash is a strategic decision for us, and we have an objective of deploying at least a good portion of the excess cash within the next 4 to 6 quarters.",
         "Regarding our forward-looking comments. While there is uncertainty regarding the operating conditions in the second half of the year, we have chosen to restore a full year EPS guidance to provide additional perspective of what we are currently seeing for our business. Our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS of $1.10 to $1.25 assumes that, consistent with our comments on our last call, the second quarter represented the largest negative impact of the pandemic, and there will be steadily improving operating conditions during the second half of the year. Lastly, our guidance for full year net CapEx remains at $260 million.",
         "And with that, we\u2019ll open up the call for your questions."

            "Hey thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. So maybe if you can provide a little bit more context into what assumptions do you have in the guidance, recognizing you have some improvement baked in for Intermodal coming into the third quarter, as you take those actions you outlined. But what else do you see across the truckload business, both a regular route one way and dedicated. I think that would be helpful just to understand what you\u2019re expecting here as we look to the back half of the year."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, Brian. This is Steve. There\u2019s quite a number of assumptions, as you would imagine, inherent in there. You mentioned Intermodal, certainly, we expect improvement in those margins as we move sequentially into the third quarter here, as Mark indicated. And we feel pretty confident that we\u2019ll make good progress to getting much closer to our targeted margin range in the second half than was experienced in the second. So that is an element inherent in our guidance. We expect continued growth in our dedicated deployment, a number of tractors that we have a nice robust pipeline and the new business wins that we\u2019re executing against, as we speak. That\u2019s another element that we expect to be contributors in the second half. And we do see a firming price environment. Obviously, we play predominantly in the contract space, but there are elements of -- there are actions that we can take, and we\u2019ll be taking that help further the margin profile in the truck space, as we go into the second half. Those are the biggest levers in the bulk business, I think, is seeing recovering nicely as well. So they will be helpful contributor. Mark, other dimensions that come to mind?"

         "Remarks": [
            "So maybe, Mark, you mentioned the second half focus on improving, I guess, the freight basket in yield, within, I guess, driving, in particular, granted, you have any contract exposure, but do you think the market\u2019s positioned well enough to maybe get a little more project feed or mini bids or retenders as we do seem to be at an inflection point, where we might start hearing more of that, assuming things hold the way there are now. Or is it too early to anticipate some of that incremental improvement, and this is more of a 2021 story?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Brian, I think as we\u2019ve kind of assessed the market, the capacity condition, some conversations and expectations of what our core customer community expects in the second half of the year, I think there is a reasonable chance that project work, additional coverage at perhaps different than the current, contract pricing gives us an opportunity to certainly around the edges and to start to shape and improve the yield profile really across all of our service offerings. And so obviously, we can\u2019t have a major COVID second wave that shut the economy out in all those type of items. But assuming that we keep in a reasonable recovery, both from a health standpoint of the nation, I think we have a decent chance of improving the basket through the second half of the year."

            "Got it. And then one more for you, Mark. Just on the supply side, you mentioned all the factors of lower orders, the drug and alcohol testing, fewer trainees. They also mentioned that the public policy decisions moving through Washington. Can you expand on that? I assume you\u2019re referring to the hair follicle testing, which has been tied up for quite some time. But we\u2019re also hearing some rumors at least that it might actually finally move forward. So what\u2019s your expectation on timing for that? And do you have a sense as to what could be coming out of there? And what type of impact it might have on the industry?"

      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I think, certainly, the science is very important and I think becoming more broadly accepted from the regulatory standpoint. And so we\u2019ve been working and doing this for a number of years. And I think we\u2019re as close as we\u2019ve ever been for that being to become the more of the standard. Exact timing, I\u2019d hesitate to throw a specific date out there. But also, I think there\u2019s other public policy issues relative to unemployment insurance and other things that could tie me the top of the funnel for industry, new industry participants.",
            "I think our professional driver community, in general, not only at Schneider, but across the industry, has responded to the challenges and the needs of the nation extremely well. And, but any time you start to have outside forces start to play with the new entrants coming into the industry, which could be the extended unemployment or the continued slower, lower class sizes and new school slots that are available, I think, will continue to put pressure on the overall capacity situation. And that won\u2019t resolve itself quickly.",
            "There\u2019s a long recovery period, before even once things start to loosen up there before that materializes itself and added capacity. So I think all of those ingredients give us a little more confidence. Again, we have to see it play out that we\u2019re going to be in a tighter capacity situation for a few quarters here."

And then maybe kind of within that, how quickly do you think you can start to realize some of the tightness in the market with better contractual rates? I know, typically, it tends to be a little bit first-half weighted. But how do you see that playing out?"

If you look at where we are in the book, both on the Intermodal side and the truck side, we\u2019re about 80% through, but we also have some very early in the cycle pricing that we\u2019ll have to see if we have to go back and address. But as we look out through the year, we think we have a reasonable chance being net positive year-over-year as we head into the fourth quarter, has a combination of not only contract spot, but also increased opportunities in the special service and project space. So we put all that together. Again, I think we believe we\u2019re well positioned to still have a positive impact yet in 2020."

Clearly, with the revenue rebound, there should be some incremental leverage. But historically, I don\u2019t know if the margins necessarily have improved in the third quarter. ",
            "And maybe layering in sort of your thoughts around driver availability. I know you talked a little bit about it. But are you starting to see some pressures there? Are there any incentives or anything that you have had to include that may kind of show up in third quarter potentially impact that historical sort of seasonal pattern of operating ratio on the truckload side?"

            "Yes. This is Steve. On the, you mentioned the driver costs, and that element, I think, could be a bit of a headwind as we enter the second half of the year. The average cost per hire is ticking up a bit and the driver availability is diminished, as we\u2019ve talked about here. So that\u2019s in the mix and contemplated in our guidance. At the same time, I think we see some efficiency improvements and network fluidity, particularly in Intermodal and other items like that, that will be favorable. So obviously, if we\u2019re to do the math, we\u2019re indicating that we\u2019ve got a good shot at making in the second half what we made in the second half of last year. So I think that would be some pretty solid performance."

You referenced some network actions that you\u2019re taking, but also some work you\u2019re doing on the sales side and the operations side. Could you just expand on that for a moment?

And so I think we have -- sitting here the best view that we\u2019ve had in some time relative to the network and how that should play out in the second half of the year. And certainly, what\u2019s also a tremendous help to us is a number of our \"nonessential shippers,\" particularly in the apparel retail or the specialty retailer, now starting to come back online. And really, it took all late in the quarter -- in the second quarter for that to start to gain some traction. And so that had some negative impacts not only to the volume that we\u2019ve experienced in the second quarter, but also the network implications. So how we view the commercial activity that took place in the second quarter and the balance issues. While we still have to work through those, those won\u2019t be magically done in 1 quarter. We do think we\u2019re going to be materially improved, both volume and in network balance. And so drive some of the inefficiency that we experienced in the second quarter out. And those are pretty decent flywheel effects for us relative to margin improvement. That\u2019s why we\u2019re -- believe we can make some material progress towards our long-term targets here in the third quarter."

Just sort of curious if you could talk about what you hope to accomplish through that partnership."

We strongly believe you\u2019re either going forward or you\u2019re going backward. And so technology deployment and alignment is critically important. What we -- philosophically, we have identified several places where we believe it\u2019s important that it\u2019s our secret sauce that we must develop and feed internally things like revenue management, things like network and asset optimization, owning the connection and interface digitally between us, our customers, our driver community and third-parties. But there\u2019s also, I think, a great opportunity to look for some collaborative partners who bring a real domain expertise and some innovation that we can combine ultimately with our scale, with our intellectual capital to have increased speed results and effectiveness. And so we took advantage of what we thought was a great opportunity with Platform Science and the industry\u2019s need for an improved telematics. And we think what we\u2019re embarking upon with Mastery and Jeff Silver is another such opportunity. And particularly, as our strategy has evolved from our initial quest implementation around the blending of our asset and our non-asset world in, obviously, the things that Jeff has done and his background here on automation and efficiency, combined with our scale and our assets. And so we\u2019re really excited about where we\u2019re getting started there. And we think that we\u2019re going to have some great success in that partnership. So really excited about that."

But it does sound like the network, particularly out west, is tight for a variety of reasons, and we\u2019re starting to see some transactional and related surcharge put into place now. To what extent are you concerned about network fluidity? We\u2019re in a relatively seasonally weak period, but markets very tight there. Just kind of talk through or maybe offer some perspective as to some of the dynamics that are going on real-time because they just seem to be a little bit unusual."

I think that\u2019s just a function that we go from -- an industry some pretty low volumes to a very rapid and quick recovery in volumes. And it takes some time to get just -- like it takes time for our network -- as an Intermodal provider, I think it takes some time for the rail network to respond to that with crews and positioning of equipment. And we\u2019re seeing some of that certainly. And you mentioned the place, I think it\u2019s most pronounced, which is in the Southern Cal market presently. I think that will improve over the next couple of weeks. But again, I think, again, one of the reasons we\u2019re bullish on the recovery in Intermodal, we think it\u2019s going to be a good, a solid demand market for the rest of the year. And so I mean that does mean we\u2019ll probably have time to time some pressures across the network and, from congestion to some ebbs and flow on reliability. But overall, I think we\u2019ll start to see some relief of the current condition here in the next couple of weeks."

You mentioned that spot pricing is above contract pricing by 10% or more. I think there\u2019s concern that some of the disruptions that we\u2019ve seen in the market recently could be short-lived. As you think about contract pricing and the trajectory that we may be on as we exit the year and look toward 2021, I know it\u2019s too early to be talking about 2021. But is there a reasonable kind of benchmark that we can think about in terms of what contract rate growth can be during the next bid cycle just given the disparity that we see at the moment between spot and contract pricing, both on truckload and Intermodal?"

And so that\u2019s a great starting point. But we also are looking at places within our dedicated services and our other parts of our asset piece that we see this partnership helping with. And so it will be embedded and connecting into our Quest ecosystem. And if you know Jeff, he likes to move at lightning speed.

And so they still have almost upper single-digit growth in the east year-over-year. It still demonstrates the interest that customers have in the long-term positioning between truck and Intermodal.

And we have a number of kind of awards that are yet to be implemented and that we think can continue to drive some of that recovery in volume that -- with such a big impact in the second quarter. Pricing is in a similar fashion to truck, maybe just down a little bit further. Still low single digits, but that might take a little longer. There\u2019s usually generally a little bit more of a lag between truck and Intermodal pricing.

And I think it really does start with where you kind of finish there, which was a highly reliable and consistent rail network, which we\u2019ve seen just great progress in that over the last couple of years. When you\u2019re in conversations with customers, what\u2019s the most often discussion as it relates to really anything Intermodal, it\u2019s -- if we can get the reliable and consistent. And sometimes, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 3 days or 4 days or 5 days transit. If it\u2019s just consistent, then they can tweak the inventory play to take advantage of the full load economics value that Intermodal provides. And so -- and we\u2019re seeing that with our growth in the East particularly because of that highly reliable truck-like service. And so it really just does come down to consistency. And I think customers can generally adapt a bit relative to the inventory that may be slightly different between Intermodal and truck. And so that\u2019s why I still think there\u2019s a great play for Intermodal in an increasingly e-commerce world because of the full load economics of moving even high-replenishment product or fast-moving product, et cetera. So -- and just like in truck has had a lower length of haul over time, it\u2019s likely to play out in some respects of the Intermodal network as well. Obviously, I\u2019m not talking all the import activity. I\u2019m talking kind of the domestic source product. And so that whole reliability is what\u2019s key."

So I think over time, I guess, I should say over, as we progress through to 2020, we would see more of those unit growth coming into the dedicated arena as we get, as I mentioned, late in the quarter, these are average numbers in the quarter that we kind of report publicly, but the new business start-ups and the recovery of some of the nonessential got back online more late in the second quarter. So you\u2019ll see, I think, a little bit more of a shift towards that dedicated number as we progress through the year."

            "So let me ask, I mean there\u2019s been a lot of question on rates and your thoughts and the acceleration of repricing contracts. And the industry always seems to kind of overstate the benefit sometimes of hours of service rule, benefits or drug and alcohol as that comes up now. What about the thought of, but now it\u2019s a tight market, so we\u2019re not going to see production picking up and net quotas are low. We kind of see that reacts obviously, production was down, but that\u2019s picking up just like the autos.",
            "So companies like, you noted most of your CapEx is going to be in the second half, and so we\u2019re going to see an increase in production. We\u2019ve heard from most of the truckers, there\u2019s going to be a kind of really big ramp-up in the second half in production. Do we start seeing, I guess investors have asked a lot, do we start seeing a cap on rates and the rate potential here because we start seeing a big pickup in that build? Maybe just expand on that and give your thoughts on kind of the other things that can kind of keep that down and really allow the rates to get to where they need to be."

I would characterize, certainly, in our case, and I think in many others, is that\u2019s more of a delay in replacement first half to second half that\u2019s not necessarily, to interpret that as growth, we would have taken additional units in the first half of the customer, or excuse me, the OEMs could have delivered on them, and we would have been more on plan. So the change has nothing to do. And I think that\u2019s playing out across many fleets as well, Ken. So I won\u2019t over interpret first half versus second half."

What\u2019s your outlook? Is this a period where you\u2019re starting to really scale on the side of that, on the gross revenue side, to see that the top line give you that growth? Or are you starting to expand? Is that the reason for working with Jeff and his team? Or is that just more on the cost side? I just want to understand if you\u2019re focused more on the top line there."

If you\u2019ve been following our Logistics business, it\u2019s been a consistent growth driver for our enterprise, but also competitively. And we like this 50-50 mix. We don\u2019t want to be too heavy, one direction or the other so that we can be more responsive and resilient to market. And it\u2019s a place that\u2019s been a technology incubator for us to advance some of the automation features and the digital footprint of the enterprise. And what we\u2019re going to do with Mastery is just an extension and accelerator of that same thought process."

But there\u2019s a lot of really small opportunities that we take a look at. But it takes something, it will take something special to get us really motivated or, I don\u2019t, we are motivated, so that\u2019s the wrong use of words. But something that checks a lot of the boxes for us to act upon it. So we continue to screen and are interested. And that\u2019s just kind of where things are."
