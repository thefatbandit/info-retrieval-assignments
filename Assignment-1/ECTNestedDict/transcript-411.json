         "Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to McEwen Mining's Q2 2020 Operating and Financial Results Conference Call. Present from the company today are Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner; Peter Mah, Chief Operating Officer; and Sylvain Guerard, Senior Vice President of Exploration. After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]",
         "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob McEwen, Chief Owner."
      ],
      "Peter Mah": [
         "Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. At Gold Bar, gold produced was 6,100 ounces in Q2, and for the first half of this year, 15,200. Production was impacted by shutdown in April for COVID, and we operated on a single shift during May and June. Getting back on track, we started 24-hour operations towards the end of July and are ramping up towards feasibility levels in Q3.",
         "And optimization and improvement plan has been developed, and we are targeting improved costs and throughput. The implementation of that project started in late July and is progressing quite well. Also, work has progressed quite positively on the optimization of mining and processing cost scenarios, and we expect resource and curve update in Q4 this year.",
         "Moving on to Black Fox. Gold produced was 2,200 ounces for the quarter and 10,500 for the first half of this year. Again, production was [barely] impacted by the COVID-19 shutdown. We had slower-than-expected ramp-up as the mine resumed normal operations, lower grades from longer stope exposure times that were blasted before the shutdown and delays in development timing that limited our stope access.",
         "Going forward in half two, production costs are expected to come in-line with pre-COVID-19 performance. What's new? Pleased to report the West Flank 280W, we got in on the ore development, which is 5 months ahead of schedule, and we encountered high grade that we anticipate will lead to stopeing this year. Froome is on track for first ore in Q2 2020. And we expect commercial production to be reached in Q4 of next year. And the Black Fox complex expansion study, it's out for tender and will be awarded next week. ",
         "And we expect to complete that first step of that study, the preliminary economic analysis in Q4. A little bit about our gold resources in Canada. We thought we'd just summarize them, you know a total of nearly 3 million ounces in Canada, split kind of equally between our Lexam properties and Timmins, and our Black Fox Complex.",
         "Next slide, our organic growth expansion strategy. The main objective of this strategy is to convert resources to near-term total gold equivalent production of greater than 300,000 ounces per year that is sustainable, low-cost and leverages our three operating regions in the Americas. The strategy currently consists of seven projects: the Black Fox Mine, its extensions; Froome; Grey Fox; Stock; Fenix; Gold Bar; and Gold Bar South. And several of our projects are under review, such as the Lexam properties I mentioned in Timmins and the Tonkin oxides. And we'll be reporting on those in the following quarters.",
         "The Fenix project is advancing towards feasibility expected in Q4 2020. Based on the preliminary economic analysis, financial model, and using updated metal prices of 1,500 gold and 19 silver and a 22.4 peso exchange rate, the IRR is 44% and the NPV at 5% discount rate is USD 112 million. At spot prices, it improves. Using $2,050 gold and $28 silver, the IRR rises to 97% and the NPV just north of USD 252 million.",
         "On the next slide, I'll touch on some highlights for improvements at the Black Fox Mine and give an update on some of our near-term production projects, such as Froome and Grey Fox. This next slide shows Black Fox and the 2020 mine plan areas that we develop towards \u2013 it's created some new mining opportunities, and we acted on those in the first half of this year. Gray represents mined-out areas, blue is the 2019 year-end resource, and red is our planned stopeing and development, respectively, the dark red shows the actual development.",
         "Two examples of what's different in the upper part of the mine are the 240 East. It's a new stopeing area, which so far has added about 26,000 tons for the 2020 plan. Recently, we got in at \u2013 on the 280 level and developed some very nice high-grade areas of that West Flank. And \u2013 pardon me, sorry, and in the West Flank, that 300 to 280 area. Both of these examples will increase working phases, result in shorter hauls and more flexibility.",
         "All the areas shown on this slide are active development, stopeing and definition drill programs this year. Beyond these opportunities, an assessment will be completed towards the end of 2020 to determine if a bulk low-grade opportunity exists in the future. This next slide shows some of the new West Flank drill targets shown in red, which are in close proximity to Froome declines and could add to production at Black Fox this year.",
         "The following slide is the Grey Fox project. It's one of the most exciting opportunities we have in our project pipeline. The company expects it will become a long-life core asset, representing a strong foundation to build our future upon. The inset in this slide shows the conceptual high-grade Grey Fox pit shown in gray. They target the Contact, 147 Northeast, 147 and South Zones.",
         "Also shown is the new Whiskey Jack discovery above and to the right of the Contact Zone and the existing Gibson Portal and underground workings towards the left-hand side of the inset. A [stopeing] study and trade-off analysis to assess open-pit and/or underground mining while maximizing the Stock mill capacity will be completed in Q4 2020 this year.",
         "On the next slide, this is just an update of where our Froome twin ramp access is overall average about 30% complete. You see on the right-hand side, the Froome decline was colored at the bottom of the Black Fox pit. The red dot shows the location of the ventilation ramp as of July 31, which is a little bit beyond 37% complete, actually around 40%.",
         "We expect to reach the ore body by Q2 2021 and to begin a transverse and longitudinal stope development, shown here in light green on the left-hand side of the slide. This forecast includes a conservative estimate of advance through the fault zone shown in the middle of the slide ahead of the red dot. Commercial production is expected in Q4 2021.",
         "On the next slide, this slide shows some important advantages of the Froome project compared to Black Fox. It's a shallower deposit suited for low-cost productive bulk mining, and it's not beneath the pit. It has more consistent grades and continuity in a wide disseminated style mineralization, wider expected mining widths ranging from 15 meters to 40 meters for the most of the deposit.",
         "Larger stopes equals more efficient underground development and mine sequencing. A lower gradient and a straighter ramp also will help haulage and reduce underground congestion. We're in fair to good ground conditions. And so, we expect positive results with dilution and grade control.",
         "That concludes the operational and projects update. I'll hand over to Sylvain to provide the Q2 exploration results."

      "Rob McEwen": [
         "Thank you, operator. Good morning, fellow shareholders, ladies and gentlemen. It's a great day we have. Price of gold and silver have been climbing over the last couple of months. And I was reminded the other day, someone called up and said, \"You said gold was going to $2,000 an ounce.\" And that was a couple of years back, and they said they thought it was impossible.",
         "Now we're just over $2,000 an ounce. Silver is on a real tear. And it looks like given all of the quantitative easing that's been going on in the world and the amount of debt, we're going to see much higher prices. If you take a look at the Indian rupee right now, it's \u2013 the price of gold has just taken off over there. And I think that's a good example of what's about to happen to a lot of other currencies and the price of gold in those currencies.",
         "Q2 was not a quarter we're proud of from a standpoint of performance, but we are proud of something about Q2, in that we put the health of our employees before profits. We started with the PDAC. And when COVID came along, we said, \"There's a risk to our employees being at that conference because of COVID,\" and we didn't want to contribute to the spread. So we said, \"Well, we have a booth, but we're not going to attend. We're not going to \u2013 no one in the firm is going to that conference.\"",
         "And early on, after that, we decided to suspend operations at our mines. And that had a very serious impact on our production. The expenses were there, but the ounces weren't produced. And so in this quarter, we see \u2013 in the \u2013 just past quarter, Q2, we've seen numbers that make me sick when I look at them. But I'm comforted in knowing that we've protected our employees. And it's really important that they be protected because they're the life and the longevity of these operations.",
         "Going forward and you'll hear from Peter today that production is picking up at all of our operations, and we expect our cost per ounce numbers to go back to where they're reasonable in the ensuing quarters. We also have got some interesting exploration news that Sylvain will speak to you about.",
         "So, at this point, I'd like to turn the presentation over to Peter to talk about our operations.",
         "Hi, Sylvain. Thank you. Sorry, a technical glitch. Peter and Sylvain outlined to you what's going to happen in operations, and we're continuing to see excitement in our exploration.",
         "Looking forward and when I look into the near term, the next couple of quarters, we're going to see more ounces and better operating costs. That will be followed by economics studies on Grey Fox, Stock, Fenix. Froome will be advancing, getting closer to the ore body. We've been constrained with our capital given the lack of production in the second quarter, but that will be partially addressed by the more ounces.",
         "I have to say, I'm really excited about the growth prospects. We've, over the years, been adding properties, and now it's starting to consolidate, and it will become easier for you to see what we have. There's a very significant organic growth pipeline that is concentrated in several regions that I think when you look out and you can see the potential for 300,000 ounces a year coming from a few tightly contained areas, it gets quite exciting.",
         "My confidence remains high, although I've been discouraged by some of the setbacks we've experienced, but recently, I bought another 2 million shares, bringing my holdings up to 82 million shares. I believe that we're going to see improving fortunes in the company, but we're \u2013 and that's going to be doing \u2013 as a result of the work we're doing, but also, the gold and silver price is just beginning to move and the world is starting to think about what is going to happen to our currencies.",
         "And we have seen a period most unique. In the past, you would see one country or a region where a number of countries have abused their monetary base, abused their currency by pushing out a lot of money and incurring large amounts of debt. This time with COVID, we have seen a universal response where governments have expanded their money supplies to try to assist their citizens, but this is without precedent and is going to have an explosive impact on the value of gold and silver and other hard assets. And I'd just say to you, add to your positions wherever you are, whatever you're holding in the precious metal space, and you're going to have a great ride.",
         "Thank you very much. I'd like to open it up for questions."
      ],
      "Sylvain Guerard": [
         "Thank you, Peter. At Gold Bar, our exploration drilling activities were focused primarily at the Pick West pit and the Gold Bar South satellite deposits. In-pit drilling confirmed significant gold mineralization, grade and width over the West Pick area and provided additional key information to assess reinforcing our model.",
         "At the Gold Bar South satellite deposit, which is located at lower elevation, about 3.5 miles southeast of Gold Bar, we are completing a 10,000-meter drill program. Drill last year results have been positive and the program is successfully confirming shallow zones of plus 2-gram gold mineralization.",
         "In addition, drill results are extending mineralization towards the south with new drill intersections of about 2.4 gram per ton over 104 feet, 2.2 over 95 feet and 1.2 gram per ton over 125 feet, as well as to the northwest of the deposit area were shallow intersections of 0.7 gram per ton gold over 60 feet and 0.6 over 60 feet were obtained.",
         "The 2020 drill program is also significantly reinforcing the geological understanding and control of gold mineralization, which occurs mostly along the stratigraphic contact and at the intersection with northeast-southwest trending fault. The Gold Bar South resource will be updated in Q4 permitting for the development and production from Gold Bar South is progressing, and we expect to start mining the satellite deposit in the second half of 2021.",
         "In Timmins now, drilling was mostly devoted to closely spaced definition drilling of gold mineralization within our adjacent of upcoming mining blocks. The BlackRock deposits remain open to the west and [at depth], along two structural control driving the geometry of the mineralized zone or ore shoot, as shown with the yellow arrows on the slide. The level of structural complexity is very important at Black Rock, and we are putting more efforts on understanding the control and geometry of the mining areas as well as we keep advancing our drilling.",
         "Several high-grade intercepts were generated from these ore definition holes, including, as highlighted in yellow on the slide, 19.9 gram per ton gold over 3.5 meter. This is infill hole testing, gram mineralization adjacent to circle drifting over the 340 level. 162 gram per ton over 3.2 meter, this include a 1,000 gram per ton intersection over 0.5 meter, and this is coming from the West Flank extension of the mine.",
         "Finally, very recent definition drilling in the Deep Central Zone around the 860-meter level return an impressive high-grade intersection of 44.8 gram per ton gold over 5.8 meter, which include 149 meter over 1.5 meter.",
         "On this, I will return the call back to Rob. Thank you."

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks, Rob. Yes. So to address the question, we looked at the COVID expenditures in kind of twofold. Well, I guess there's three ways of really looking at it. One is the direct incremental costs required to improve our safety and security standards as people enter and leave the sites. So those costs related to things like temperature gauges and other thermometers, some increased security at the site and checkpoints, minor changes to workstations. And those costs are really not that significant and not expected to be significant on a go-forward basis. The more significant costs that we incurred were directly related to the shutdown, and those items were disclosed in our financial statements and specifically relate to labor that we continue to retain during that shutdown period.",
            "Yes. So keeping our labor force available for that ramp-up was the first big bucket of costs that were incurred. And then the second category of costs that were incurred were really around the idle capacity costs where we're operating below our capacity. And so we're still paying for wages, utilities, overhead. And those costs were all categorized as production costs applicable to sales. And those costs would continue to the extent that we're not back at capacity in the coming months."

You mentioned in the release, and I quote, \"I can see an exciting organic growth pipeline of projects ahead that could potentially push our production to 300,000 ounces per year.\" Just to clarify, we're talking about acquisitions here. And if \u2013 I don't know how much color you're willing to provide, but is there a time line that did you want to assign to that?"

      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "It'd be in the next three to five years, Heiko, and it wouldn't be acquisitions. It'd be all organic. We're looking in the Timmins area, we have the Stock property, Grey Fox and Froome is coming on stream first. And then we do believe that the Black Fox Mine, as you heard Sylvain mentioned some of the drill results we're getting there, it's a shallow mine. We think it goes deeper. And also on the west, we're exploring getting very good results. So, that mine needs more time, more exploration, but we could see it coming back on stream and adding.",
            "Also, the Timmins properties, one of the attractions of the Black Fox complex when we bought it was the proximity of the Lexam properties to the mill. And so, we were looking at everything sort of as single assets. And this is \u2013 right now, we're looking to integrate all of those. So that's in the Timmins area. They're about four or five areas that we feel can bring that production up and give us a long-life asset, running at better than 100,000 ounces a year.",
            "And then you go, Gold Bar had a setback when its ounces were cut back earlier this year, but Gold Bar South is expanding. And some of the results there are quite attractive, long intercepts of good grade for an open pit. And then we go down to Mexico, and the Fenix project is \u2013 it's looking like it would provide a very robust feasibility study. But that's all \u2013 those are all properties we own 100% of. So, we don't have to go outside. We don't have to acquire any companies to get that growth."

Just kind of curious, specifically talking about the second half of 2020, how do you see the grade profile improving? Because grades have certainly come up from second quarter and comparable to first quarter and with good drilling results near the west flank area. Just kind of wondering, how do you think about the grades there?"

So, just draw a note to that. Yes, going to Black Fox, yes, I think we're excited. We're seeing some very good high-grade intersections in the west flank and also historically on the Central Zone. These are some of the areas that I reported on here earlier and on Slide 9, and we do expect to see some nice-grade areas. It's early days. We've just gotten access. ",
            "We're drilling. We are pretty excited about the 280 area. We went and sealed out on that recently and saw some nice grades and significantly higher than our head grade. But it's too early to guide on that, but I can report very encouraging. That's why we're excited about the extensions of those zones up to the Froome decline area, which I showed you those targets, which we do have some drilling on them to give us some confidence.",
            "So, I think it bodes well. It's early days. And as Rob said, we need to invest some time and more drilling into these areas in the future. And the story of Black Fox isn't over yet on the west flank and certainly down at 840 and the depths we're sealing out there and have hit some high grade. And we expect to see some extensions of that center zone going down as well."

That's all I \u2013 about all I can say about it now. We have a great bulk, chambers, open stopeing kind of deposit that's really suited for low-cost mining, the 5% decline short haul.

And so you have to do a lot of setup work, a lot of drilling, a lot of prep work. And then after, we mine them out very quickly to minimize the stand-up time and fill them quickly.",

We have very wide intersections, 15 to 40 meters the hanging wall that we can set up transfer stopeing, primary, secondary, really much more contained, bigger stopes, 10,000 to 20,000 ton range we can get up to depending on how our stability works out. So just a whole different type of mining approach. So less \u2013 bigger, bigger, more productive stopes and tighter development will translate into better overall costs, including all-in sustaining. But as I said, when we complete the FS final edits, we'll guide on that."

Like are you still mining in only Pick West? Have you solved the grade reconciliation challenges there? And just like on a follow-on there. I mean guidance was withdrawn earlier this year, but now that you're ramping back up, you clearly have a plan there at Gold Bar. So do you have a production target at Gold Bar in Q3 and Q4?"

            "Absolutely. There were a number of questions there. Hopefully, I captured them all. So full capacity, what we're meaning there is ramping up to 24 hours operations and targeting our feasibility level production. We've currently, in end of July, increased our crews and ramped up to 24 hours. We are achieving somewhere in the range of 5,000 to 6,000 tons a day. We are targeting 7,000 tons a day and, in our optimization plan, our cost savings of a couple of hundred dollars an ounce cash cost.",
            "In Pick West, exactly, that's where we'll be mining throughout 2020 and hence where most of the drilling that Sylvain has spoken about in the past, where we're focused on mining resource estimate coming out in Q3. And then we'll be updating a reserve based on the optimizations that I spoke about earlier in terms of mining and process costs. It's early days for reconciliation versus the model. We're just getting into it now and just starting on that.",

There's a whole bunch of areas where there's opportunity and efficiency improvements with our existing plan. So, this is no CapEx.

And the unweighted average was 100.5%, but had I weighted it to 2018 when there was more gold, it would have been higher. And the question is, if you could explain the top-cut procedure at Black Fox, I'm not critical of it.

And one thing I really have difficulty in understanding that you don't really have to go into it, though, is the massive underperformance, I see, if I put you up against your benchmark, which when I look at it \u2013 and I call your benchmark GDXJ if that's fair."

This year, that you didn't expect, no great fault of your own, and I understand that these do happen. But when I look at you compared to your benchmark, the underperformance is just staggering. If I would have said in 2016, where the price of McEwen Mining would be when we had $2,000 gold and $28 silver, certainly would have projected multiples beyond this.",
            "My question now comes to my concern when you said you're moving towards 300,000 ounces of possible production, but your time line of 3 to 5 years. We're 5 years into a bull market, a bull market that I think all of us knew was coming because of central bank policies. We perhaps have 5 years left to run before the central banks destroy all of our currency. And my concern is I've been waiting for all these years. Are we going to miss this bull market? How long is it going to take to return to even your benchmark or outperforming your benchmark? Thanks very much."

Historically, we were trading about the GDXJ and GDX. So, we've gone south and everybody has gone north. And when I look at it, we're in a transition period right now, and I believe the future is looking brighter, although it's taking its time to show up.",

And I think we have to deliver a couple of quarters, good quarters to demonstrate that the turnaround is in progress. We all believe internally that the turnaround is occurring, we can see improvements, but it has to manifest itself in ounces produced and cost so that with the rising gold price, we're participating with it rather than just trading dollars.",

And as you know, building trust takes a long time, and it's going to be built by demonstrating that we're delivering on our promise.

It was subsequently increased several times, and it's now $8 billion. Given our market cap of less than $800 million, 300,000 ounces won't get us there unless they're extraordinarily inexpensive to produce, which I'm not going to say we're going to be able to do.",
            "So, there would have to be M&A to get to there. I think the goal is still a very good goal to have because there's only one gold stock in the S&P 500. But \u2013 and that would drive a lot of investment dollars towards Newmont, which is the only one in there. I do think we're coming into a market where there will be a lot more investors looking for exposure to gold and gold and silver. So, I think you'll have a strong movement in the sector there. And maybe that index is something that \u2013 you'll get the performance without the index in the near term."

Just had a few questions covering a broad range of subjects, but I guess if we first start with the Slide 9, which is your \u2013 an accounting of your measured and indicated, as well as inferred, it looks like it's both Lexam and Black Fox, and it's 3 million in measured and indicated and inferred, another over 1 million. And I guess to me, it sounds like if your goal is to only go to 100,000 ounces, that seems like a lot of resource. It seems like it would take a long time. I guess is there a reason you would not want to go ramp up to mill capacity, which is, I guess, it sounds like it's 200,000 at the stock mills?"

So, kind of north of kind of 150,000 tons per month is where we're targeting. Again, we're hesitant again to guide on that until we complete our resource update, reserve and mine plans, but I think the capability and capacity is there. And we worked on the blending. We can get the tons. It then becomes can we deliver them out of the pit and all that scheduling, sequencing stuff."

We'll be operating 24 hours a day. And as Peter said, we just started 24 hours a day.

We have a property nearby, our Tonkin property, which has a good-sized resource on it. It's oxides and sulfides. And at some point, that \u2013 see if we can incorporate some of that into our Gold Bar production.

And I guess has the attitude or has at least the environment changed where rather than operating as more of a charity, that the government is now going to be allowing \u2013 it seems as though there has been a significant increase in Argentina's overall foreign reserves to take profits out of the country or to at least \u2013 if you do generate them, which looks like it'd be a strong possibility at today's prices?"
