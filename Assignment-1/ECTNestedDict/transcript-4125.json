         "Thank you, Zalman. Good morning, everyone. Net interest income before provision for credit losses for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was 259 million compared to 154.8 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of 104.1 million or 67.2%. The increase was primarily due to the merger with LegacyTexas in November 2019 and loan discount accretion of 24.3 million in the second quarter of 2020.",
         "The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was 3.69% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 3.16% for the same period in 2019 and 3.81% for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, the core net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 was 3.33% compared to 3.14% for the same period in 2019 and 3.36% for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.",
         "Noninterest income was 25.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 30 million for the same period in 2019. The current quarter noninterest income was affected by 3.9 million in write-downs of certain assets and general impacts of COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "Noninterest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was 134.4 million compared to 80.8 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the merger with LegacyTexas and one-time merger-related expenses of 7.5 million due to the core system conversion that occurred in June. In addition to these merger-related expenses, the second quarter results reflected elevated expenses related to increased mortgage activities.",
         "With the core system conversion and operational integration process behind us, we do not anticipate any significant merger-related expenses going forward and we expect to start realizing the remaining cost savings beginning in the third quarter of 2020. We expect this additional savings to be about 7 million to 9 million per quarter. This combined with the savings realized in the first and second quarters will be in line with our previously stated 25% cost savings in noninterest expense.",
         "The efficiency ratio was 46.56% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 43.74% for the same period in 2019 and 42.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Excluding merger-related expenses of 7.5 million, the efficiency ratio was 43.97% for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The bond portfolio metrics at 6/30/2020 showed a weighted average life of 2.69 years and projected annual cash flows of approximately 2.3 billion.",
         "And with that, let me turnover the presentation to Tim Timanus for some detail on loans and asset quality. Tim?"

      "Charlotte Rasche": [
         "Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Prosperity Bancshares second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. This call is being broadcast live over the Internet at prosperitybankusa.com and will be available for replay at the same location for the next few weeks.",
         "I'm Charlotte Rasche, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Prosperity Bancshares. And here with me today is David Zalman, Senior Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; H.E. (Tim) Timanus, Jr., Chairman; Asylbek Osmonov, Chief Financial Officer; Eddie Safady, Vice Chairman; Kevin Hanigan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Randy Hester, Chief Lending Officer; Merle Karnes, Chief Credit Officer; Mays Davenport, Director of Corporate Strategy; and Bob Dowdell, Executive Vice President.",
         "David Zalman will lead off with a review of the highlights for the recent quarter. He will be followed by Asylbek Osmonov, who will review some of our recent financial statistics; and Tim Timanus, who will discuss our lending activities, including asset quality. Finally, we will open the call for questions. During the call, interested parties may participate live by following the instructions that will be provided by our call moderator, Jamie.",
         "Before we begin, let me make the usual disclaimers.

All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.",
         "Now, let me turn the call over to David Zalman.",
         "Thank you, Tim. At that time, we are prepared to answer your questions. Jamie, can you please assist us with questions."
      ],
      "David Zalman": [
         "Thank you, Charlotte, and good morning to everyone. I would like to welcome and thank everyone listening to our second quarter 2020 conference call. We are pleased with our second quarter 2020 results and with completing the operational integration of Legacy on schedule in early June.",
         "The team members from Legacy, now Prosperity, have been excellent and we could not have achieved such a smooth integration without their commitment and efforts. I want to thank all of our team members who worked many hours to make this happen. We remain excited about the combination and look forward to continuing to build the best Bank anywhere.",
         "For the second quarter of 2020, we showed impressive returns on average tangible common equity of 19.98% annualized and on average assets of 1.61%. Our earnings were 130.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with 82 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of 48.6 million or 59.1%.",
         "Our diluted earnings per share were $1.41 for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $1.18 for the same period in 2019, an increase of 19.5%. The second quarter 2020 earnings per share of $1.41 includes a $0.22 income tax benefit, a $0.06 charge from merger-related expenses and a $0.03 charge for the write-down of fixed assets related to the merger and some CRA funds.",
         "In summary, there was $0.22 of benefit to earnings and $0.09 on deductions, mostly related to the merger. Loans at June 30, 2020 were 21.025 billion, an increase of $10.4 billion or 98.6% compared with $10.587 billion at June 30, 2019. Our linked quarter loans increased $1.898 billion or 9.9% from the $19.127 billion at March 31, 2020, of which $1.392 billion were SBA Paycheck Protection Program, sometimes referred to as PPP loans.",
         "Mortgage warehouse loans also increased 843 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter. Our core loans, excluding held for sale and the warehouse purchase program and the PPP loans decreased $311 million.",
         "However, a portion of this decrease resulted from loans that were intentionally removed that were identified in our due diligence of Legacy. We saw strong loan growth in the first part of the second quarter, but that slowed as business shutdown or reduced operations in response to various government orders.",
         "Our deposits are June 30, 2020 were $26.153 billion, an increase of $9.265 billion or 54.9% compared with $16.888 billion at June 30, 2019. Our linked quarter deposits increased $2.326 billion or 9.8% from the $23.826 billion at March 31, 2020.",
         "Historically, our deposits are lower in the second quarter of the year compared with the first quarter and then begin to increase in the third and fourth quarters for us. But this year, second quarter deposits are higher. A large portion is from the PPP loans as well as reductions in customer spending, in customer saving more right now.",
         "With regard to asset quality, has always been one of the primary focuses of our Bank and always will be. I have always said, you will like us in the good times but love us in the bad times and this is playing out to be true again during this pandemic and oil price downturn.",
         "Nonperforming assets totaled 77.9 million or 28 basis points of quarterly average interest earning assets at June 30, 2020. We continue to provide relief to our own customers through long extensions and deferrals when possible.",
         "For the second quarter of 2020, net charge-offs were $13 million. Of these charge-offs, 12.4 million were related to PCD loans with specific reserves of 28.5 million that we acquired in the merger. Further, 16.1 million in specific reserves were released to the general reserve in addition to the 10 million provision for loan losses for the second quarter.",
         "M&A activity has subsided during this pandemic, although there are some conversations and probably a few deals working, we believe that the M&A activity will start to pick up as businesses reopen and economic activity increases.",
         "Size does seem to matter now, especially with lower net interest margins, the need for increased technology and the potential for additional regulatory burden if there\u2019s a change in the administration. An example is the increased volume at our customer call center with many older customers wanting to set up online and mobile banking that have previously not been interested in doing so.",
         "The economy, the blue-chip consensus forecast estimates that fourth quarter 2020 GDP will end at a negative 5.6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. However, they\u2019re forecasting a positive 4.8% GDP for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. They are also forecasting an unemployment rate of 9.4% for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with unemployment rate of 6.9% for the fourth quarter of 2021. Based on these estimates, 2021 looks bright.",
         "We are positive about our company\u2019s future. While our operating environment and economy is changing frequently, we remain focused on addressing whatever comes our way and taking care of our customers and associates. Prosperity continues to focus on building core relationships, maintaining sound asset quality and operating the Bank in an efficient manner while investing in ever-changing technology and product distribution channels.",
         "We intend to continue to grow the company both organically and through mergers and acquisitions. We want to develop people to be the next generation of leaders, make every customer experience easy and enjoyable and operate in a safe and sound manner. I want to thank everyone involved in our company for helping to make it the success it has become. Thanks again for your support of our company.",
         "Let me turn over our discussion to Asylbek, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss some of the specific financial results we achieved. Asylbek?"

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note today's event is being recorded.",

         "Thank you, Asylbek. Our nonperforming assets at quarter end June 30, 2020 totaled $77,942,000 or 37 basis points of loans and other real estate. The June 30, 2020 nonperforming assets total was made up of $71,595,000 in loans, $187,000 in repossessed assets and $6,160,000 in other real estate. Of the $77,942,000 in nonperforming assets, $12,173,000 or 16% are energy credits; $12,073,000 of which are service company credits and $100,000 are production company credits.",
         "Since June 30, 2020, $15,786,000 has been removed from the nonperforming assets\u2019 list through the sale of collateral. This represents 20% of the nonperforming assets dollars. Net charge-offs for the three months ended June 30, 2020 were $13,001,000. $10 million was added to an allowance for credit losses during the quarter ended June 30, 2020.",
         "The average monthly new loan production for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 was $871 million. This includes a total of $1,430,000,000 in PPP loans booked during the quarter. Loans outstanding at June 30, 2020 were $21.025 billion. The June 30, 2020 loan total is made up of 39% fixed rate loans, 36% floating rate loans and 25% loans resetting at specific intervals. The fixed rate percentage increased somewhat due to the inclusion of the PPP loans.",

It seems like you guys have a lot of room to move deposit costs lower. Just looking at where you were with your rate cycle, so just was curious to get your thoughts there too."

It\u2019s a little bit elevated because some of those PCD loans we\u2019re working out, which they had discounts in them and so those being paying off, bringing additional fair value income this quarter. But if you\u2019re looking going forward, we project $11 million to $13 million based on what our model shows right now."

I\u2019ve always said that sometimes in really good times, people pay more than we do. And then when things get a little tougher, we kept our rates a little higher than everybody else. But we are looking at it right now to reduce our rates a little bit and we should probably do that this week probably at some time."

And if you look at our deposits, our CDs are at the higher rate right now but we\u2019re waiting for them to be repriced.

And if you look at for next quarter, we could see declines in the amount somewhere in mid-single digit I would say. But there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces. It\u2019s how the PPP forgiveness is going to work. And we have, as every bank experience right now, quite a lot of liquidity coming into the bank because of the PPP program we had and the government stimulus --"

There\u2019s $2.3 billion in extra deposits that came in, a lot of people thought 1 billion of that is probably from the PPP loans. But you have to think or I have to think that it\u2019s that money we put out on PPP, they should have used half of that or more. Some are saying they\u2019re didn\u2019t spend it because they\u2019re waiting to see if \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the reason is, but I think there\u2019s more \u2013 there\u2019s going to be more liquidity than we anticipate, so you have that. You have the PPP loans. And if we do have some room on the deposit side, I would still say to be careful. You\u2019d still see some \u2013 probably getting some decline of maybe mid to single digits probably just to be careful on everything I think."

And if we buy some securities, which we\u2019ve been reluctant to do because they\u2019ve been so low, that changes things.

But remember, like in my notes, I said that we have elevated mortgage activities which have some expenses related to that. So with the current environment with the rate being so low, we see a lot of \u2013 getting new loans or mortgage loans. So that could keep up the volume which would increase the expenses. But if you look at our current expense for the second quarter, if you take out the one-time expenses and reduce that amount by 7 million to 9 million, that\u2019s what we believe is going to be on the next quarter."

But I think that regulators at this point in time if I think that we bought back stock, we have no agreement with them. But I would think they would look at negatively if you\u2019re buying back stock right now until we see further what the pandemic is doing. So I don\u2019t see us buying stock back unless there\u2019s some really downturn in the stock, really strong or something like that. For the immediate future, I think it would be looked at \u2013 it would be frowned upon as they would say, I think, by the regulators if we bought some stock back right now probably."

Although having said that, from what they tell me at some of the meetings I\u2019m at is they still say that oil and gas companies, there\u2019s still a large amount of bankruptcies to come from that. I feel pretty good where we\u2019re at.

            "I think the businesses that are most affected by this pandemic are really the hotel, motel loans which we have about 380 million in that and then restaurant loans are about a little over 200 million. But again, we feel pretty good where we\u2019re at with most of our customers. I don\u2019t want to be Mr. Happy, but I don\u2019t want to be a downer either. I think that we have given some extensions I think that we extended or had forbearance on. Again, I\u2019m going to give you some numbers. I\u2019m going to let somebody else jump in just in a minute, but we extended about 6,700 loans. It\u2019s about 9.5% of our loans outstanding. On the other hand, at that 6,700, approximately 4,800 of those already started to being repaid. So don\u2019t take those for exact numbers. I\u2019ll let somebody give you the exact numbers. I\u2019m talking off the top of my head. But we really feel pretty good where we\u2019re at. Those loans that we charged off this quarter were probably \u2013 the $12.4 million of loans that came over due to the Legacy merger and we fully had reserved on those. In fact, we had $28 million reserved on that. So we were able to put another $16 million into the general reserve plus $10 million that we put. So I feel like we have a real good quarter. Again, I don\u2019t want to be a Pollyanna and say things are great, but I feel we\u2019re probably one of the best banks to be with, in these kind of times. And Kevin, you may want to jump in on some of the oil and gas, what\u2019s your feelings on that too."

            "Yes, I agree with David. If we look at stress areas, it\u2019s things to be on your top of mind. It\u2019s probably hotels, although I don\u2019t think we have any of them past due at the moment and I don\u2019t think we have any office buildings or retail centers past due either. Now some of those are in deferral periods and we could talk about that as a separate issue. On the oil and gas front, obviously the stress is less now with prices closer to $40 than it was and we saw single digit and worst kind of oil and gas numbers. Our portfolio continues to work its way down. If you just look quarter-over-quarter, the portfolio shrunk $80 million over the quarter. Unused commitments shrunk from, I don\u2019t know, 390 million to 277 million and that\u2019s largely due to redetermination time. So it was us cutting commitments at redetermination time and putting everybody on MCRs. A little over 54 million of that 80 million decline in oil and gas was from former Legacy clients that has marks on them, and that\u2019s where a lot of lost content we reported came from. Just in terms of loss content on that 54 million is about 18%, but we had close to 48% reserves up against that. So if you think about the reserve level prior, call the mark, that was put on this 18 months ago, it was pretty prescient of the Prosperity team to put big marks on that portfolio, because we had over $28 million of that $54 million was marked and we have loss content of about $12.5 million. So overall, I think the portfolio energy-wise is in good shape, a, because of the marks; b, because of the hedging; and c, because we continue to strike it down and we were pretty aggressive during the redetermination time about putting monthly commitment reductions in every deal. So I think we\u2019re managing the risks around that portfolio as good as could be expected."

            "Obviously, none of us can firmly predict the future. We can only talk about with certainty where we are today. But it\u2019s a lot better than one would probably think it would be. As of June 30, on the nonperforming assets list, we only had two hotels. H1 had a balance of about 7 million. So we had a total of about 14 million. One of them has already sold. So 7 million has come off the list and it\u2019s part of that number that I gave, that total number that\u2019s come off the list since the end of June. So there is only one remaining hotel in the nonperforming asset list, and it\u2019s got a balance of about 7 million and it\u2019s actually current right now. They\u2019ve resumed payments and they\u2019ve kept it current for a while. To be conservative, we left it on the list at the end of the quarter and we\u2019re going to watch it month by month going forward. But the good news is, it\u2019s current right now. There was only one restaurant on the nonperforming asset list at the end of the quarter and it had a relatively moderate balance of about $43,000. It happens to be SBA guaranteed and we\u2019ve already filed a claim with the SBA to get them to honor their obligation as it relates to that loan. If you look at the total hotel portfolio, about $52 million of that portfolio carries an SBA guarantee. And on the restaurant side, about little over 10 million of the portfolio carries an SBA guarantee. So right now, things are reasonably stable as it relates to our hotel/motel and restaurant loans that we\u2019ll just have to see how the future plays out."

So we recognized about $4 million on the fee income during the second quarter with about $2 million per month and we deferred all the fees, including fees \u2013 and deferred some direct expenses over 24 months. As you know, once those loans are going to get forgiven and pay off, we can recognize that income at that time. But for time being, it\u2019s on the deferral for the 24 months. I think on average, the average balance I believe for the second quarter was about 750 million or so on PPP loans.

            "This is Kevin, Brad. I\u2019ll take that one. Obviously the quarter was really strong, averaging $1.843 billion I think and ending at much higher numbers, almost 2.6 billion. So that ending June month end balance gives us a great running start going into July because those balances carried on for much of the month. Based upon what we\u2019re hearing from our clients, we expect the end of this month to be really strong again and that comes to us by virtue of them asking for over lines or extending the facilities at larger levels to get them through this really robust period of time. What\u2019s particularly interesting to me is that the turn days, despite all that volume, the turn days which typically run for us and the industry at about 17 days only ran at 14 days this quarter. So when you think of that in terms of the amount of activity that have those level of balances with that quicker turn days, it\u2019s pretty remarkable. I\u2019ve been around this business a long time. And typically, we would average in a month \u2013 or the quarter 23,000 to 25,000 files and Q1 was a new record. We did 41,000 files and we did almost 82,000 files in Q2. So the amount of volume going through there is pretty high. And that volume does produce still off levels of fee income. We\u2019re collecting, I calculated this morning about $37 a file that we touch in fee income. So I think Q3 \u2013 and again, who knows beyond where we sit today, but if we\u2019re able to stay reasonably stable where they are, I think Q3 is going to be even stronger than Q2 was by \u2013 if we averaged 1.8 billion, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we average 2 billion or 2.1 billion for the quarter. We\u2019ll just see how it plays out from here; but all pretty strong. Finally on rates, I think rate pressure has kind of subsided I think finally and I would tell you that all of our loans have LIBOR floors in them. So everyone that we have \u2013 and we have 39 customers [ph] now has a LIBOR floor of LIBOR being 1%. So any moves in LIBOR from where we are now would impact pricing like it has in the past."

And even to get the $10 million that we had this time we had to really try to be on the high end of our provisioning. So my gut feeling is unless something changes, I don\u2019t see us provisioning. I just don\u2019t see it right now. I\u2019m looking at Merle and the credit guys, they look to \u2013 they\u2019d always like to have everything in the world in there. But the bottom line is, again, I see us highly provisioned. When we do these stress tests, I remember where we had the DFAST test and even under a stress test, the most that you would lose over a two-year period \u2013 compared to what the stress test say, if they\u2019re right, I don\u2019t see it. Now the question is, what do regulators going forward through this pandemic or until we get some guidance to see what we have. But I think the 1.9% in our reserve for loan loss is too high for a bank like ours. Having said that, I think the regulators want to see that. I think our Chief Credit Officer wants to see that. But I think that $354 million that we have in there, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve lost that since I\u2019ve been in banking. If you add all the years together, I\u2019d bet we haven\u2019t lost $100 million or $80 million and that\u2019s with some of the banks we\u2019ve bought. So God help us, I hope we don\u2019t get there. But in my lifetime, I\u2019ve never seen us getting close to we had in and what we would use. That\u2019s just me. But having said that, I know we have to be careful. We don\u2019t know when this will all end and when everything will open back up. But I don\u2019t know \u2013 I\u2019ll throw it out there. I don\u2019t see it. I think it\u2019s too much, but it is what it is and we have these calculations and we have to go with the calculations, and it\u2019s not just me running the bank.

So it\u2019s just very hard to say. I\u2019m inclined to agree with you, David. It\u2019s hard to imagine that our portfolio is going to fall apart overnight. But world is what it is and anything can happen."

As has been previously mentioned, we extended some payments on \u2013 to be precise, it was 6,727 loans. And the total aggregate outstanding balance of those loans together was $3.626 billion. And that\u2019s extending at least one month. Most of them were two or three months. There have been a few, not many, that has gone as far as four months being extended. But really the vast majority of those were two or three-month extensions. Out of that 6,727, 4,864 of those loans have already resumed making normal payments. And the aggregate total balance of those 4,864 that have resumed payments and are still paying, that balance is 2.283 billion. So how long those that have resumed payments continue to do so, obviously we can\u2019t say with certainty. But those customers are implying to us that they have reasonable stability in their business right now. We still continue to extend a payment here or there for a few customers, but not near as many as we did in April and May. So everything seems to have stabilized a bit, but obviously there are just no guarantees."

            "Okay. I\u2019m trying to read my notes here that they wrote for me. But I think we started off with about 400 million in loans. I think we started around 400 million in loans from Legacy that we decided that we thought that we would try to outsource out of the banks. I think so far, we\u2019ve moved out in the first quarter and the second quarter about $131 million of those loans. So still about 283 million left there, so we\u2019ll have to get through that. But as far as loans go, again, we had tremendous growth in the PPP. We had tremendous growth in the mortgage warehouse. We actually saw a decrease. I think if you looked in our core loans this quarter, I think I\u2019ve said \u2013 I\u2019m talking off the top of my head again, so forgive me if I\u2019m wrong, but around 311 million, 312 million less in core loans. And out of those core loans, I would say that about 65 million of that was really made up of these loans that we talked about earlier that we got out of them. We had some recoveries on them. So that was about 65 million. And I would say probably just some of the other loans from Legacy, the merger in the CRE product. We\u2019re not putting on as many of those particular loans. Naturally, in this type of economy doing commercial real estate on the retail side, it\u2019s not something we would jump in. So having said that, if you look just at core loans, I think you were down about \u2013 if you take out the 65 million, I think that was about 1.6% and of course you\u2019d have to annualize that. The 1.6% for the quarter, we were down. Really when I look at everybody else, that was considered pretty good. I think going forward, to give a number of loan growth going forward, I think it\u2019s hard, like I said before. The shutdowns \u2013 we were having great growth both in the first quarter and first part of the second quarter. As the shutdowns came, we saw things contract. So with us having to get out of still a couple hundred million dollars in loans, $280 million in loans at Legacy and looking at the pandemic where it\u2019s at, I would have to forecast that probably the best you could hope for, for us would probably be anywhere from a 0% to 3% growth rate this time, I think. That\u2019s just me talking. If somebody else may want to jump in? Kevin, you want to jump in on that?"

Some new things are getting approved, but I think you can all understand it\u2019s a really tough time to underwrite a loan. The retail center comes in and what you do? How many of these people are paying and how many of these people are going to be able to continue to pay and how many are being deferred? Same on the commercial office building, what\u2019s the future of commercial office buildings? I don\u2019t think we \u2013 it would have to be a pretty spectacular amount of equity and a really strong guarantor to do a retail deal or a commercial office building deal. That\u2019s an already constructed office building. Forget new construction for the most part, unless it\u2019s again a really, really unusual situation. It\u2019s just \u2013 I want and like to say it\u2019s a really tough time for underwriting. On the other hand, I can tell you it\u2019s really easy. There is a lot of things we\u2019re just not going to touch during this period of time. So while loans shrunk, I guess the $312 million number and a good portion of that, it was running off of some stuff out of the Legacy portfolio we didn\u2019t want to keep. It\u2019s going to be tough in this environment and I\u2019m not worried about not producing loan growth right now. I\u2019d like to see a little more clarity as to what underwriting looks like across the board. I think we all would before we feel better about producing a whole lot of loan growth."

We\u2019ll lose it if things turn around, but right now we\u2019re able to get a little bit better comfort if we\u2019re doing stuff we\u2019re able to get a little bit better collateral support and guarantor support I think."

Most of \u2013 we\u2019ve let all of our borrowings run out and we\u2019ve taken that money and really just funded the mortgage warehouse deal now. We\u2019re having some liquidity right now. We still haven\u2019t bought anything, probably about 400 million, 500 million. We\u2019ll probably go in and buy some security that will probably be a mixture of some floating rate stuff with some 15-year in mortgage-backed security. It will be somewhere in between. But as Kevin mentioned earlier, we hope that some of the liquidity is going to be taken up by the mortgage warehouse financing toward the end of the quarter here or in the next few months.

I think, gosh, I\u2019m talking from the top of my head, but we have probably over $1 billion a year that runs off --"

And now that we\u2019ve gone through a redetermination period under the Prosperity loan policy, all of the Legacy loans are now more conforming with Prosperity loan policy in terms of advance rates and how we do engineering and things like that. The portfolio will probably continue to shrink, Michael, before it gets any bigger because we\u2019re being particularly cautious right now, and I think we\u2019ll remain that way. But I don\u2019t see us as a Texas bank exiting the business. But we\u2019ve got a little over 3% -- between 3% and 4% of our total loan assets and that\u2019s probably not a bad place to be, maybe a shade lower than that in the near term."

And I said, well, we are in Texas and we will be in the oil and gas business. I think it will just be difference \u2013 it will be a difference in underwriting. And again, I think probably not as many deals with shared credits and private equity and stuff like that. It will be to \u2013 the oil and gas fields will be primarily more to core customers that can show in underwriting whatever they buy that that particular deal can pay itself back in four or five years.

When I talked with the team, I really couldn\u2019t tell would we really be interested in this mortgage warehouse and it\u2019s really turned out, it\u2019s really felt a great need with interest rates going as low as they have. Having the option of doing this and I feel better with it, because I feel good with their team. Their team, the mortgage warehouse team, really knows what they\u2019re doing and I have a lot of confidence in them. So I really feel good with that piece of the business. And really almost everybody that I\u2019ve worked with at Legacy, all the people are very professional, very astute. I think they are \u2013 I couldn\u2019t be more pleased, let me just say that."

Everybody\u2019s called \u2013 not everybody, but usually we have two or three deals working at any given time. That\u2019s probably not the case right now. But having said that, generally what happens in times like this is generally we get a deal that we would never have been counted on. It\u2019s a deal that somebody has some issues and they have to get out of it, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we get \u2013 a lot of it depends on this pandemic and how long it lasts, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if something like that comes to us. And we\u2019ve had deals. Even some really good deals come to us right now.
