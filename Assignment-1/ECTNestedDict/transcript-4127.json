         "Thank you, Vinay and good evening everyone. As Vinay touched upon, we made significant progress towards our stated objectives in the second quarter. Gross revenue was $2.9 million for the quarter, which represented a 192% increase from our fiscal first quarter and was our highest quarter since our initial sell into the rec market in 2018. Net revenue was $2.3 million, which was above expectations.",
         "Similar to other organizations, COVID impacted our sales in Q2. While we did see a recovery late in the quarter, the closing of retail locations was a revenue headwind in Q2. We sold 419 kilos of product in the quarter, of which over 80% with our flagship BC Pink Kush and overall average price of $5.88 per gram. Price per gram was impacted by form factor mix such as packaged versus bulk versus pre-rolls. Excluding bulk sales, the Flowr branded price per gram was $6.69, reflecting our positioning in the premium segment. We continue to be confident in our pricing strategy and do not expect price erosion in the near-term on our Flowr branded products.",
         "The total cost of sales, were $2.9 million for the quarter. Costs remained somewhat elevated in the quarter given that we sold inventory, which was harvested in Q1. As you may recall, only 10 growers in the first quarter were operational versus 20 rooms in the second quarter. Due to less fixed cost dilution and minimal automation, inventory produced in the first quarter had a higher cost base, which impacted our second quarter profit sales. The normalized cash cost per gram sold in the quarter, which exclude depreciation, amortization share-based compensation and one-time adjustments, was $3.58 compared to $4.91 during Q1 as the company began to see the benefits of this automated packaging line during the quarter.",
         "The benefits of automation are expected to be fully realized in Q3. By way of example, our Q2 bulk cash of goods manufactured was sub $2 per gram, which proves our thesis that we should expect a material improvement in the cost of goods sold in Q3 and we will have these two tailwinds at our back. The company impaired 461,000 of products in the second quarter pertaining primarily to legacy strains. We do not expect any significant legacy strain impairment going forward.",
         "Selling, general and administrative expenditures, consisting primarily of salaries and professional fees, were approximately $4.6 million in the quarter compared to $6.3 million in Q1 as the company saw the benefits of the global restructuring program announced in March and tighter expense management. As Vinay mentioned, given our leading market position, we have begun investing in our sales and marketing activities in order to drive increased distribution and deeper penetration nationally and expect the investment to continue through the balance of the year. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, which excludes certain non-cash expenditures and restructuring costs, was a loss of $2.9 million as compared to a reported loss of $6.9 million during the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in loss was largely due to both improved revenue and lower SG&A cost.",
         "As we noted during our last call, the organization closed $21.6 million non-brokered private placements of convertible debenture units led by management insiders in the second quarter. The private placement allowed us to bolster our balance sheet position while driving towards becoming cash flow positive in the second half of this year. We will do so by increased demand driven sales, scale and operational efficiencies and the SG&A measures previously discussed. Achieving positive cash flow will be the first step to achieving our targeted adjusted EBITDA margin of 25% in 2021. The company did not expect any further material CapEx investments in K-1 this year as the facility is operationally complete. However, we do expect some modest CapEx investment in the third quarter to complete the R&D facility, which is expected to be fully completed and operational in the early part of the fourth quarter.",
         "You may recall in our Q4 financials, the company financially impaired all of Flowr Forest inventory pertaining to our Health Canada review of a regulatory interpretation. Based on the outcome of the review which was recently finalized, the company plans to destroy and dispose of the Flowr Forest inventory in the fourth quarter of 2020. It is important to note that there is no impact to either of the company licenses based on the outcome of its review and no restrictions have been placed on our operation. Portugal is expected to begin contributing to revenue and profitability in early 2021. We are extremely excited about the progress with the crops in Aljustrel and are enthusiastic about the Terrace Global and Flowr partnership. To-date, we have received approximately $1.3 million in funding from the partnership and expect additional funding to support the operation in the third quarter. In terms of the third quarter, the organization is expecting revenue growth of at least 30%.",
         "I will now turn the call back to Vinay for closing remarks."

         "It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Vinay, our CEO."

      "Vinay Tolia": [
         "Thank you, Thierry. Earlier this afternoon, we released our second quarter results, which showed progress against our financial and strategic objectives. In particular, sales momentum continued to build for us in our Canadian rec business. We believe that the fundamental thesis that we have been speaking about since we founded Flowr is playing out in the marketplace, specifically that people want high-quality cannabis and that there is a bifurcation of quality in the market.",
         "On the one hand, there has been a proliferation of value brands and offerings at the lower end of the market and on the flipside, where we compete and what we are seeing is a clear willingness for consumers to pay up for higher quality and differentiated products, such as our flagship, BC Pink Kush. We are proud to say that over the past 1, 3 and 6 months, our BC Pink Kush has been the number one selling SKU at the Ontario cannabis stores by dollar volume in sales to retailers. That\u2019s the top selling SKU regardless of size. As retail distribution in Ontario continues to expand, we have increasing visibility and demand for our product as Ontario continues to be our biggest market.",
         "We have also made incremental investments in sales and marketing, which we believe will drive greater awareness and penetration throughout the country. In addition, we recently received our AMP approval from Quebec and expect to be in market in the fourth quarter. Our facility was fully operational in the quarter with all 20 of our grow rooms in production by mid-April. As such, we produced approximately 1,350 kilos of dried flower, with over 85% of that being BC Pink Kush. A good portion of that product was harvested in late June, which set us up \u2013 would set us up well as we entered Q3. Yields in the facility continued to improve and the trend is in the right direction. We have recently had a record harvest of over 88 kilos from a single room.",
         "In other production news during the second quarter, lab testing showed a wider dispersion of THC levels than historically observed in certain plants. We traced the dispersion to specific mother plants whose offspring were not consistently producing dried flower and the expected THC bands. We do not plan to use these mother plants for production beyond the third quarter. At this time, we are unable to confidently assess how much production will have lower THC levels and historically observed as a result of these issues. While we are taking steps to ensure these types of risks are minimized in the future, our facility design and the ability to isolate areas allows us to address these issues in a systematic way. We believe we have enough inventory on hand currently to meet demand and reiterate our objective of becoming cash flow positive in the second half of 2020.",
         "Now, I will turn it over to Irina to run through more of our financial details from the second quarter.",
         "Thanks, Irina. As Irina mentioned, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we didn\u2019t talk much about Europe and I would like to share my excitement around the upcoming harvest in Portugal in late Q3, early Q4. The crops look extremely impressive and the scale of the project is simply enormous. We believe this is the largest outdoor THC cultivation harvest in European history and are looking forward to towards commercializing the business in 2021 with our JV partner, Terrace Gobal.",
         "Back to Canada, as the industry hits more of a steady state, we see the value in building the premium segment of the dried flower market. Brands will matter and if more new stores open, they will seek to carry products they are confident will sell through just like any other retail space. A recent consumer research report by the Brightfield Group highlighted Flowr as the number seven ranked brand by awareness in Canada and had Flowr ranked number one or two in a variety of loyalty, brand promotion and satisfaction scores among the top 10 purchase brands in Canada. We are beginning to compile more data related to our consumer disposition funnel. We are seeing market increases and prompted awareness and trial use for our brand, especially in the coveted young adult demographic. The data speaks for itself. We are in the segment of the market where we want to be and we are expecting the numbers to increase with further distribution and product awareness. There is plenty of work to do, but with roughly 1,100 stores in the country, a number which is increasing rapidly, the data shows that our brand is increasingly addressing the need for a high quality experience.",

Yes, we noticed that Flowr\u2019s BC Pink Kush has very impressive performance in terms of brand awareness and consumer preferences. So, just trying to understand what differentiates your BC Pink Kush from the PC Pink Kush strength of other companies?"

      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, a good question. So, as we have said, these strains aren\u2019t created equally. The chemical composition of the plant depends highly on the genetics and in the condition in which it\u2019s grown. Our expertise is only \u2013 really on the cultivation side and where we can control basically every variable to have a very consistent and create a plant that really expresses the full genetic potential of the particular phenotype. So, you can give a handful of people, the exact same genetic study material and we can end up with wildly different product. So, I would say that our product is different than other Pink Kushes on the market. And then in particular, Pink Kush really needs a \u2013 as I mentioned before, we are doing a lot more data on the consumer and this is all data where that hadn\u2019t been available over the last year. And we are seeing that primarily people are using the product during the evening to unwind and that\u2019s really an occasion that suits the kind of characteristics of Pink Kush. So, it\u2019s \u2013 we are in a space when we kind of \u2013 the usage occasion space that we want to be in and we are in that space which \u2013 with the product which we believe is the highest quality product in that category."

What\u2019s exciting about some of the agreements that we had is that we are selling through on our BC Pink Kush, but we are also selling through as part of our agreement some legacy strains as well.

The issue on distribution deals is it\u2019s hard to get signed distribution deals without Certificate of Analysis. So, without knowing the exact chemical composition of the plant, it\u2019s hard to secure deals. What I can say is that we have seen lots of interest in the product.

Obviously, there is a lot of visibility on what we are doing in Portugal and large part because of the partnership with Terrace and they have been great partners with us. And we do not expect any problem selling any GMP product that we produced this year, particularly product that ends up becoming high THC, high THC being defined as north of 20% THC. I mean, there is just endless demand for that product in the market.
