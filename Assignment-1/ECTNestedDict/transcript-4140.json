         "Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call today. We are thrilled to host our first call as a public traded company. Our successful IPO was a significant milestone in our long journey, illustrates [ph] capital for growth and significantly increased our visibility.",
         "We are one of the world\u2019s leading providers of online services to the LGBTQ community, a huge market according to Frost & Sullivan in 2018 over 450 million people worldwide self-identified as LGBTQ. We are dedicated to providing comprehensive lifetime services that satisfy the needs of our members.",

Global monthly active users for the quarter reached 6.4 million, an increase of 11.2% year-over-year. Being a public company, we\u2019ll further broaden our user base and help us to connect with the LGBT community globally. We aspire to make a wider impact in the world and the way we live our passion and execution capability will enable us to achieve profound success in the future.",
         "Our commitment to connect and serves the sub-groups within the LGBTQ community is demonstrated by our recently completed acquisition of LESDO, a leading location-based social networking service provider servicing the lesbian community in China. Lesbian is an important sub-group within our community, with nearly 200 million lesbian globally, a 38.5% of the LGBTQ population.",
         "In China, the lesbian market is fragmented, with many small service providers lacking the ability to do sustainable product development or provide consistent services. LESDO represents a great opportunity for us to enter and consolidate the lesbian market. We will continue to enhance and improve services and deepen the connection within the community.",
         "A key element of our growth strategy is to establish a multi-brand platform that connects and serves multitude of growth within the LGBTQ community. LESDO is our fourth strategic move to execute the element of our strategy.",
         "As we expand our business globally, our initiatives overseas are prudent. We evaluate market readiness, local market size and geopolitical influences before market entry. We believe the overseas market opportunity is huge, but we will selectively expand only to markets that meet our strategic criteria. Meanwhile, we will continue to strengthen our leading position in existing markets and improve our monetization capabilities.",
         "Last but not least, we are proud to be ranked among the top companies for corporate social responsibility, or CSR. Since day one, CSR has been rooted in our brand DNA, and it\u2019s an important aspect of our culture. We encourage you to read our first ESG and CSR reports, which we issued this month. Those two reports outlines our commitment to social responsibility and sustainable development.",
         "Now, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Ben, who will provide details of our business and financial performance."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the BlueCity\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instruction will follow at that time. As a reminder, we will be recording today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions]",
         "Now, I will turn the call over to Lingling Kong, Head of Investor Relations for the company. Ms. Kong, please proceed."
      ],
      "Zhiyong Li": [
         "Thank you, Lingling. Thank you, Mr. Ma, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As Mr. Ma just mentioned, we successfully completed our NASDAQ IPO, raising approximately US$85 million in gross profit. Our solid cash position gives us extra strength and flexibility to expand into new selected markets, address new groups within the broader LGBTQ community via acquisition and invest in technology, products and services.",
         "We got off to a great start as a newly public company. Despite the COVID-19 outbreak, slow economic recovery in China and geopolitical uncertainty, we delivered solid second quarter results anyway. Revenues were RMB247.4 million, up 32.2% year-over-year.",
         "Monthly average users for this quarter on the Blued app grew 11.2% year-over-year, reaching 6.4 million. Notably, nearly half of our MAUs are outside China. Total paying users increased to 58.5% year-over-year to 458,000, up from 289,000 in the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Net loss for this quarter was RMB3.3 million, significantly improved from the net loss of RMB12.2 million in the second quarter of last year. The better bottom line was due to higher revenue, favorable revenue mix, as well as better operational efficiency.",
         "In addition to solid financial results, we executed our strategy with the acquisition of LESDO, as Mr. Ma just mentioned. This acquisition marks the significant milestone in implementing our strategy to serve sub-groups within the broader LGBTQ community.",
         "Based on extensive research of the lesbian market, we found that lesbian users behaved similarly to our male users. They present strong user engagement and intending to engage in deeper emotional connections using this platform. They also have a greater willingness to pay for high-quality services.",
         "As we integrate LESDO, we will leverage our years of operational experience, strong financial resource and advanced technological platform to drive business development. This acquisition is just the beginning of our multi-brand, multi-demographic strategy. It will enable us to test, learn and build a powerful platform that further leverages and optimizes our operation system to support each unique, recognizable brand and service in each specific group of our community in the future.",
         "LESDO will build the foundation for the success of our future acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we can broaden our community beyond homosexual men and refine and enrich our service offering to drive further masturbation opportunities. We aim to serve LGBTQ community globally with comprehensive lifetime services.",
         "Over the past few years, we have executed our clear expansion strategy in particular. We have penetrated overseas markets by leveraging our unique products and services offered through the international version of Blued app. We start with a strong and centralized technology backbone, augmented by localized regional operations. Currently, we are the leading online LGBTQ platform in India, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.",
         "Moving forward, we continue to build our global presence and improve brand awareness internationally. In this vein, we held our first-ever StayProud: A Virtual Pride Experience, on June 28, with Todrick Hall, the American singer, actor and LGBTQ advocate.",
         "As you probably know, June was the pride month, a month to celebrate to the LGBTQ community. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak in lieu of a live event, we host a two-hour virtual event. The event strengthened the ties and bonding in our community. We brought together LGBTQ influencers and users from around the world to dance, perform and showcase their talents in celebration of pride amount. [ph]",
         "This event was very successful and certainly increased our visibility in our global community. About 16 anchors from nine different countries gave great performances, and over 50 influencers and tens of thousands of people participated through Blued International.",
         "During this very event, the number of daily visits to this live streaming event and the number of live streamers online, all reached record highs. We also made meaningful progress on the monetization front.",
         "In addition to the live streaming services provided via Blued International, we introduced a membership service in late 2018 \u2013 excuse me, 2019 for overseas markets. For the second quarter of 2020, revenue from overseas markets increased rapidly 31.3 times from the same period last year, contributing 11% of total revenue compared with 5% for the same period last year.",
         "At the end of July, we were ranked as one of China\u2019s top companies for corporate social responsibility as compiled by the China CSR Research Center. Its annual report is one of the most authoritative CSR Performance Index in China. BlueCity scored 61.43 points, while the average score of the 50 international companies rated was 35.71. We are honored to achieve this ranking as it demonstrates our commitment to CSR efforts.",
         "Furthermore, on August 18, we released our first ESG and CSR report. Please refer to our company website for details.",
         "Now, I will go through our operational and financial highlights for this quarter. Before I go into details about our financial results, please note that all numbers presented are RMB and for the second quarter of 2020 unless stated otherwise, or percentage changes on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise sufficient.",
         "Our total revenue increased by 32.2% to RMB247.4 million. Revenue from live streaming services were $210.2 million, up 25.2%, primarily driven by our driver \u2013 by our diverse services and rich content offering in China and globally.",
         "Quarterly paying users for live streaming services increased by 35.3% to 174,000. ARPPU decreased 7.7% to 1,206 as our promotions encouraging users to develop the habit of paying for services. Revenue from membership services was RMB15.8 million, up 129.6%.",
         "Our quarterly paying users for membership services increased 75.4% to 327,000. While ARPPU increased 30.8% to 48.3. This fully demonstrates our future monetization potential for membership services. We will continue to actively explore new ways to enrich our service offering and accelerate user consumption habits.",
         "Revenue from advertising was RMB10.7 million, up 17.8%. Other revenues were RMB10.7 million, more than doubled compared with RMB3.2 million for the same period last year. The increase was mainly attributable to the growth of our merchandise sales to the e-Health, [ph] our health-related service.",
         "Total transaction value facilitated by e-Health increased by approximately 230%. Cost of revenues increased by 30% to RMB170.3 million. Gross profit was RMB77.1 million, up 37.4%, representing gross margin of 31.2%, 1.2 percentage points higher than last year.",
         "Revenue sharing is a key component of cost of revenue. As we solidify our market leadership, we expect to further reduce the revenue sharing percentage in order to improve gross margin. Meanwhile, with increased revenues from high-margin membership services, we expect to further diversify our revenue stream and achieve higher gross margin.",
         "Looking at operating expenses. Revenues totaled RMB82.6 million, up 24%. Selling and marketing expenses were RMB41 million, up 33.1%. The increase in sales and marketing was mainly due to the higher advertising and promotion expenses associated with global expansion, as well as an increase in the headcount in sales and marketing.",
         "Technology and development expenses were RMB31.3 million, down 2.8%. This decrease was mainly attributable to lower content server and bandwidth cost as a result of our improved procurement efficiency. This was also partially offset by an increase in the headcount in technology and development personnel.",
         "G&A expenses were RMB10.3 million, up 194.3%. The increase was mainly due to increases in staff cost and higher professional service fees.",
         "Net loss was RMB3.3 million, compared with a net loss of RMB12.2 million last year. Net loss margin was 1.3% compared with 6.5% in the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Adjusted net loss was RMB3.3 million compared with adjusted net loss of RMB8.2 million in the second quarter of 2019, what a remarkable improvement. Going forward, we will continue to advance our live streaming models, upgrade membership services to promote the consumption of paid services of our users.",
         "We will also broaden our user base within the LGBTQ community. We are a prudent global expansion and selective acquisitions. We are confident in our long-term growth prospects due to our diverse service offerings, deep penetration in China and the growing global expansion.",
         "With that, let me offer guidance for the second-half of 2020. We expect net revenues in the range of RMB575 to RMB615 million, representing a year-over-year revenue growth of 35% to 44%.",
         "That concludes our prepared remarks. Let\u2019s now open the call for questions. Operator, please proceed."

Our paying user grow pretty nicely this quarter, but MAU grow a little bit slower than that. So I was wondering what is our strategy in the last couple of quarters or mid to long-term? What is our strategic focus? Would that be MAU growth or paying user growth?",
            "And my second question is about second-half guidance. It seems our second-half guidance imply our growth, revenue growth is going to accelerate from second quarter. And so I was just wondering what was the \u2013 what is the fact that the driver behind this acceleration? Is that related to our last two acquisition? Or if it\u2019s not related to that, which line of the revenue would it be live streaming membership is going to accelerate in the second-half?",

And then what is the strategy going forward? Would that be \u2013 would that grow to apps as successful as the Blued app we have today? Thank you very much."

And in terms of MAU and paying user growth, yes, you can see accelerated growth in our \u2013 in number of paying users. But that\u2019s not necessarily related to the growth of MAU. Because as we mentioned during the conference call, we continue to enhance monetization models in our existing service and products. So that\u2019s why we have put efforts \u2013 put lot of efforts to refine our products, especially in membership services.",

For the second-half \u2013 for the first-half of 2020 due to COVID-19, we\u2019ll see some slowing down in our family planning services as they have trouble to go abroad.
