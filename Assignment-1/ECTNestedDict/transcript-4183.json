      "Brian Halligan": [
         "Thanks, Chuck. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for joining us today. The world\u2019s been through a lot in the last few months. Collectively, we\u2019re still weathering the storm and I\u2019m happy to share progress HubSpot's made over the last quarter.",
         "Constant currency revenue growth was 26% in Q2 and non-GAAP operating margin was 9%. Total customers grew 34% year-over-year surpassing 86,000 while multi-product adoption continuing to grow nicely, representing over 38,000 customers.",
         "We were fortunate back in Q1 to have some wind in our backs after a strong start to the year. Nevertheless, the onslaught of the global pandemic was felt throughout our company and our customer base and much of our spring was focused on helping our customers and partners respond to the economic downturn.",
         "Today, I\u2019m thankful to say that the disruptive headwinds we faced early in Q2 has eased and might have even begun to shift a bit in our favor, helped along by some nice execution in some important plays we ran. We\u2019ve had a strong product year so far that\u2019s raised the power of our enterprise tier while also adding new products to the mix.",
         "This began in Q1 with the introduction of an entirely updated version of Marketing Hub Enterprise. With this relaunch came a ton of advanced features, including revenue attribution reporting, AI-powered A/B testing and account-based marketing. Marketers can now start with us at an early stage and grow with us into a large scale now that we\u2019ve released this product. Marketing Hub Enterprise is really resonating nicely for us in the market.",
         "In Q2, we introduced a new product line, CMS Hub. This is the completely re-imagined version of our previous CMS Add-on with advanced features making up of Pro and Enterprise tier. We have found strong product market fit in the midmarket between simple but limited Web site products in overly complex content management systems. CMS Hub gives companies the benefit of advanced features like dynamic content, adaptive testing and 24/7 security monitoring, with not all that heavy maintenance and design needs that comes with legacy content management system solutions.",
         "Companies and organizations like ClassPass, World Wildlife Fund and Randstad have not built sites on the new CMS Hub. The formulization of our CMS Hub through the addition of these tiers led to a really nice reacceleration in growth in our product line. You see, the traditional enterprise SaaS playbook is to cobble together a product through acquisitions. This approach has led to a pretty rough enterprise frontend for a lot of products married to a pretty solid enterprise backend.",
         "HubSpot has skewed that traditional approach. We\u2019ve chosen instead to handcraft our product in-house. You see, underneath HubSpot, there\u2019s only one view of that customer and a consistent user experience across that frontend. We\u2019ve married a consumer-like frontend with new enterprise power and this is giving us a real advantage in the marketplace. I think our patient approach and our slight obsession with Apple is starting to really pay off.",
         "Now, we haven\u2019t just been working on that Enterprise tier. To help more businesses make the transition from offline to online after the crisis hit, we reduced the first year price of our Starter Growth Suite by more 50% and increased email send in call limit. Additionally, we released greater editing controls of our ad campaigns across Google, Facebook and LinkedIn marketing starter. All of this resulted in a 400% plus increase in our starter and install base growth as free users upgraded and many new businesses moved fully online for the first time.",
         "We coupled this on ramp to HubSpot with a surge in educational content and we\u2019ve seen record engagement in HubSpot Academy as a result. In fact, in Q2 we saw nearly 150% increase year-over-year in Academy sign ups and similarly strong growth on the number of people getting certified on HubSpot, really great stuff. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the way the entire HubSpot team continued to deliver on our product roadmap embedded to help our customers amid rapidly changing times.",
         "Companies in nearly every industry have had to move their teams, their go-to market strategies and the entire customer experience online. What might have been a gradual digital transformation for some businesses has now been dramatically accelerated by the impact of the pandemic and we\u2019ve become the platform to support that transformation in the midmarket.",
         "I\u2019m encouraged by the transaction we saw in the second quarter and we see evidence of a continuation of that performance in the early part of Q3. But this short-term demand environment is still quite fluid, so we\u2019re watching things very closely.",
         "Now, I\u2019ll hand things over to Kate to take you through our Q2 financial and operating results in more detail.",
         "The story of 2020 has thus far been one of adversity. As a society, we faced the public health crisis and economic crisis and a crisis of conscience. When the dust settles, the world will be changed. We\u2019re trying to lean into the future ourselves and help pull our customers and partners with us.",
         "On the conscience side of that equation, at HubSpot we\u2019ve been working to advance diversity inclusion and belonging in our culture representation. We have a long way to go, so it\u2019s become one of our top strategic priorities.",
         "It\u2019s also become important for me personally to learn, evolve and speak out against racial injustice in the ways that I can. My hope is that what started as a story of adversity this year will become one of resilience and resilience relies on diversity.",
         "Thank you for your time. I look forward to seeing many of you again at our first-ever virtual Analyst Day as part of INBOUND 20 on September 22. We re-imagined the Analyst Day this year in more ways than one, so I\u2019ll see you all there.",
         "Okay, operator, let\u2019s open it up to some questions."

      "Charles MacGlashing": [
         "Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to HubSpot's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Today, we'll be discussing the results announced in the press release that was issued after the market closed. With me on the call this afternoon is Brian Halligan, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Kate Bueker, our Chief Financial Officer.",
         "Before we start, I'd like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's press release. During this call, we'll make statements related to our business that may be considered forward-looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements, including those regarding management's expectations of future financial and operational performance and operational expenditures, expected growth, and business outlook, including our financial guidance for the third fiscal quarter and full year 2020.",
         "Forward-looking statements reflect our view only as of today, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in today's press release and our Form 10-Q, which will be filed with the SEC this afternoon for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.",
         "During the course of today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed, and a reconciliation of the differences between such measures, can be found within our second quarter 2020 earnings press release in the Investor Relations section of our Web site.",
         "Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot's CEO and Chairman, Brian Halligan."
      ],
      "Kathryn Bueker": [
         "Thanks, Brian. Let\u2019s turn to our second quarter financial results and our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2020. Second quarter revenue grew 26% year-over-year in constant currency and 25% as reported. Q2 subscription revenue grew 26% year-over-year while services revenue declined 3% year-over-year on an as reported basis.",
         "Domestic revenue grew 20% in Q2 while international revenue growth was 36% year-over-year in constant currency and 32% as reported. International revenue represented 42% of total revenue in Q2, up 2 points year-over-year.",
         "Deferred revenue as of the end of June was $241 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings was $202 million, up 21% year-over-year both on an as reported basis and in constant currency.",
         "HubSpot ended the second quarter with over 86,000 total customers, which was up 34% year-over-year. Net customer additions exceeded 7,800 and set a company record, driven by strong demand across our entire product portfolio but particularly in our Starter Growth Suite.",
         "Average subscription revenue per customer of nearly $9,500 was down both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of the strength we've seen at the low end of the portfolio combined with elevated levels of customer downgrades.",
         "As we highlighted last quarter, we took some proactive measures in late March to help alleviate the impact of COVID-19 for our customers and partners. These included offering flexible payment terms and customer friendly downgrade alternatives to our most impacted customers and prepaying some partner commissions.",
         "As a result, we expected retention rates to trend lower in Q2 due to the weaker economic environment as well as the impact from our customer friendly programs. While we did in fact see pressure on our retention rates in Q2, we maintained a net revenue retention rate of 90% with the majority of the decline continuing to come from customer downgrades.",
         "It's still quite early, but we have seen encouraging performance from the first cohorts of customers coming off these short-term discounts and moving back to more normal pricing.",
         "I want to stress that the near-term economic environment is still uncertain, but we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that the plays we\u2019ve put in place helped our customers and partners adapt in these difficult times.",
         "The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Second quarter gross margin was 82%, flat year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 86% while services gross margin was negative 8%.",
         "Second quarter operating margin was 9%, up slightly compared to the same period last year. Operating margins in the quarter exceeded our expectations as a result of strong revenue performance as well as reduced travel and other discretionary expenses related to our shift to work from home.",
         "While we plan to maintain a disciplined approach to investment through the remainder of 2020, we expect our planned return to work initiative and continued investment in R&D to largely offset these expense savings.",
         "At the end of the second quarter, we had 3,769 employees, up 29% year-over-year. We expect total headcount growth to moderate in the second half of the year as we start to compare against our strong hiring quarters from 2019.",
         "Net income in the second quarter was $17 million or $0.34 per diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $14 million or 7% of revenue in the quarter. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 7% in 2020.",
         "Free cash flow in the second quarter was $800,000 driven by strong business performance and better than expected customer cash inflows. As a result, we are increasing our expectations for full year 2020 free cash flow to approximately $40 million.",
         "HubSpot ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. At the beginning of June, we successfully executed a $460 million convertible bond issuance with the concurrent repurchase of roughly 70% of our existing convertible bond due in 2022. As we look to the future, we remain confident that our strong balance sheet will provide us with the financial flexibility to invest for the long term.",
         "And with that, let's dive into guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2020. For the third quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $211 million, up 21% year-over-year at the midpoint.",
         "Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $7.5 million and $8.5 million. This range includes a 1 point headwind to operating margins from our INBOUND event in September. ",
         "Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.11 and $0.13. This assumes 48.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2020, total revenue is now expected to be in a range of $828 million to $832 million, up 23% year-over-year.",
         "Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be in the range of $52 million to $54 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $0.92 and $0.96. This assumes 48.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding.",
         "Our guidance reflects a view of the business that we are comfortable with today given the current economic environment, and also factors in heightened future uncertainty caused by the pandemic.",
         "As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. As a result of the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, we have seen a meaningful reduction in the headwinds related to foreign currency for the remainder of the year. At current spot rates, we now expect a 1 point FX tailwind to Q3 reported revenue and a neutral FX impact to reported revenue for the full year 2020.",
         "In Q2, we elected to begin tax affecting our non-GAAP net income which we believe better aligns with SEC guidance. Our updated non-GAAP EPS guidance for Q3 and the full year of 2020 includes the impact of this change.",
         "Importantly, this change does not impact our historical reported GAAP financials. Please refer to the table included in our press release for the historical impact to prior period non-GAAP earnings.",
         "In Q2, we excluded the accounting impact of our convertible debt repurchase from our non-GAAP net income and free cash flow. Please refer to the non-GAAP net income and free cash flow reconciliation tables included in our press release for more information.",
         "And with that, I'll hand the call over to Brian for his closing remarks."

Maybe the thing that really stood out to me was the strength of the starter package that you guys reported in the quarter and had the contributions to the overall customer growth in the quarter. As you look across and maybe try to slice and dice that strength there, any similarities within the customers that are adopting this starter package in the current environment? And then I have a quick follow up."

            "Hi, Stan. Thanks for the question and hope you\u2019re well. That\u2019s something we\u2019re actually watching relatively closely. Kate and I were just talking about that. We\u2019ve been, I would say, presently surprised with that Starter Suite adoption. Just to refresh everyone on the call\u2019s memory [ph], we lowered the price in starter suite to get the marketing, sales and service product altogether by 66%, so it\u2019s $50 a month now in the first 12 months. And we did that right when COVID started and it worked. There\u2019s been really nice adoption of it and you can see that with lots of new starter suite customers in that 1,700 net new customers\u2019 number. So we\u2019re really happy with it and we\u2019re watching those cohorts super carefully. We\u2019re looking at the quality of those cohorts, like what is the size and makeup of the company who\u2019s buying it? What is the retention rate calculation on those cohorts and what\u2019s the upgrade rate? And so far so good. They look pretty good. They are similar sized companies that were buying Starter Suite before. The retention rates look pretty good. So we\u2019re going to keep that first year of $50 for now and see if we can use that as a gross lever going forward. We\u2019re pretty happy with it."

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Perfect. And then maybe just one more. The geographic growth; U.S. slowed to 20%, international very strong at 36% constant currency. When you look across the various geographies, is it fair to say that U.S. seems to be the most impacted with all of the downgrades and international seems to be hanging in better? Any kind of qualitative commentary as far as where you\u2019re seeing the pockets of opportunity as well as strength in the various geographies? That\u2019s it from me. Thank you."

         "Speaker": "Stan Zlotsky"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. I guess at a high level, the international business is going really well and I think that\u2019s because we\u2019ve made some big investments over the last five years and we\u2019re starting to get a return on those investments, like big investment in offices. In Europe, we have a large office in Dublin now. We have Paris, we have Berlin. We\u2019ve got offices in Japan, in Singapore, in Sydney and even one in Latin America now. So those are big investments we\u2019ve invested heavily in translating not just our products into different languages but the whole customer experience in different languages. We\u2019re getting nice return on that. I think another reason international is doing so well is just unit economics are really good. We\u2019re growing fast and cost to acquire customer relative to total lifetime value [indiscernible], so we\u2019re hiring a little faster there. I guess in terms of North America, I\u2019ve continued to be bullish about it. It\u2019s a huge market. We\u2019ve got great product market that tons and tons of happy customers, a good word of mouth. The sales organization in North America is mature. I think we\u2019re set up well for steady strong growth in North America for several years to come here and I feel good about it."

            "Stan, I would just add to Brian\u2019s comments. If you look \u2013 the overall revenue growth decelerated from Q1 to Q2. And if you look at U.S. and international, what you saw in sort of the more mature, more developed markets is a very similar level of deceleration across those markets. Where we saw a bit of an outsized impact was really on some of the more emerging markets."

But in particular where you\u2019re seeing success there, is that helping to onboard some brand new customers? Are you seeing some early success there with cross selling that to the existing base? Just curious any other color you could share about that product. Thank you."

            "Thank you for the question. I guess it\u2019s a little of both. I\u2019m very excited about that new hub. It\u2019s a funny industry. The industry \u2013 down on the bottom of the industry, you\u2019ve got like really strong SaaS players like Wix and there\u2019s a company called Squarespace that\u2019s private that\u2019s doing really well down there in their SaaS product. But most of the market is buying kind of open source, client server technology. And it\u2019s funny that way. And so we feel like there\u2019s a big opportunity to build a true SaaS product and all those benefits of the SaaS product. We think we have a great advantage in this market because we\u2019ve built that CMS from scratch and we\u2019ve built our CRM from scratch and it\u2019s 1 plus 1 equals 10 when you combine those two products together with the same user interface and you\u2019re just able to create a great experience for your customers to use them together. So I feel really good about it. We\u2019re getting lots of new accounts through it and we\u2019re getting some upsell through it. We couldn\u2019t have launched it in a worse time. We launched it in April. But despite having terrible timing on launching it, it\u2019s done really, really well and I think that\u2019s going to be a big help for us, kind of like --"

And Kate I think you called out some churn which you had spoke to last quarter. So can you just give us a sense of magnitude there just in terms of what you saw? And I imagine it was in line or even better than your expectations given the outperformance in the quarter?"

            "Yes, sure thing. So Q2 billings came in probably a little bit better than what we had thought or hoped for. Most of that frankly is just driven by solid performance on the new business side. But one of the things that we talked about last quarter was that we also expected that we would see a decrease in billing term during the sort of period of economic turbulence. And we saw a little bit better performance on that regard in Q2. We continue to expect to see in our customer base some duration compression over time and that will cause billings growth to be a little bit shy of revenue growth at constant currency."

Just curious if you\u2019ve seen kind of any change in how the partner channel contribution has been holding up over the past 90 days and how much \u2013 what the strength is of those partners after you had worked with them to keep them floating [ph] and keep their business going?"

When things first started hitting in kind of mid-March, one of several things we ran was to advance six months of commissions to our partners and I think that went over really well. I think that worked for us and worked for them. They were able to kind of stabilize their business. I think it prevented layoffs in a lot of cases, so I\u2019m feeling very good about that call. And I think our partners are generally weathering the storm quite well. If I look at the numbers through Q2 and even through July, they looked pretty solid and stable. I don\u2019t see any big red flags. They seem to be weathering. I think some are doing a lot better than others, some are feeling more headwinds and some tailwinds but generally feeling pretty good about that market channel right now."

Much like we did last quarter, we sort of recognized that there is more forward-looking uncertainty and we ran a bit of a broader set of scenarios to look at the second half of the year and to try to understand sort of upside and downside outcomes.

First up, Brian, as we\u2019ve kind of gone through the impact of the pandemic here, have you found sort of pockets or verticals where you were surprised that maybe demand \u2013 you saw increased demand that you didn\u2019t see sort of pre-COVID at all?"

We just didn\u2019t have a lot of concentration in some of those industries, like restaurants and hospitality and travel. Those are pretty small for us. We\u2019ve got a heavy concentration in B2B. The other side of that is people call us SMB software. We\u2019re more M than S, like more than two-thirds of our revenue comes from companies that are over 25 employees. So we\u2019re a little bit like NetSuite is for the back office and HubSpot is to the front office. So we were definitely impacted. We felt a strong headwind as demand was soft like a marshmallow in Q2, but feel a lot better about things in June and July."

So, Brian, as we think about the pace of product innovation and we kind of look back at Mainsail, obviously you had CMS Hub come out this year. I\u2019m curious how we should think about the hubs being added to the platform over time, what that cadence should look like?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, we\u2019re certainly not done with hubs, I can tell you that. I guess if I just sort of take a step back and think about HubSpot and kind of what\u2019s going on inside of HubSpot is a year ago when we were on this call, we talked a bunch about taking a step or two back so that we could go three or four steps fast here. We were super patient about that. And that\u2019s paying off for us now. And you could kind of see it with us in January and February, we get off to just a killer start to the year. We\u2019ve announced that Marketing Hub Enterprise product did really well and we\u2019re starting to get a real return on it. The other thing around patience for us, we get a different approach to building our company and our product. If you look across enterprise software in the CRM industry, there\u2019s lots of companies in enterprise CRM. They\u2019re more like private equity companies with giant sales forces attached to them than they are like true software companies. They cobble their solutions together with M&A. We kind of handcrafted from scratch in-house. And I think over the very long haul that will set us up quite well to compete in the midmarket and I think there will be a lot of value to that. And I think it\u2019s the new way of building one of these CRM companies in that all-in-one approach is really going to pay off. The way we describe it internally these days has changed the way we describe them. We call it our primary colors. So underneath HubSpot, you\u2019ve got data, you\u2019ve got automation, you\u2019ve got reporting, you\u2019ve got messaging, you\u2019ve got these different kind of shared services underneath it. And then the hubs themselves \u2013 our product managers and our developers and our designers, they\u2019re sort of creating these beautiful applications that are really easy to use in the frontend. And increasingly this year with Marketing Hub Enterprise, CMS Hub Enterprise, they deliver a real powerful punch on top of it. So feeling really good about that product. There will be more hubs to come down the road. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve reached the edges of our vision for products we can build that help companies build great experiences in the front office here."

And then June and July, it felt like we got back on track a little bit. And the question I\u2019ve been asking myself is what\u2019s going on? How much of this is HubSpot and how much of this is COVID? And I kind of give credit to three things for the bounce back. One is, like for a long time we\u2019ve been espousing the vision of we need to move from offline marketing to online marketing, outside sales to inside sales to build a flywheel, to build great digitalized \u2013 use digital transformation to rethink your front office approach. And the stuff we thought was going to happen in the market for over the last six years really happened over the last \u2013 over six months now. It\u2019s really sped up. So our vision sort of matches the time. The plays we ran worked. We talked about the starter play. That worked really well, but there was a whole series of plays that we ran to help our customers and partners to weather the storm, and I think the team executed them really well. They were well conceived and well executed. And then the product I just talked about, we took two steps back last year so we could take four steps forward this year and I think we\u2019re getting return on that. We had two new product offerings this year in Marketing Hub Enterprise and the CMS Hub launch and our Net Promoter Scores are sky high. We broke a bunch of records with our Net Promoter Scores from our customers. So yes, I think it\u2019s been \u2013 we don\u2019t know what will happen in the future. This has been a terrible tragedy for so many people and so many companies and we don\u2019t know what will happen to the economy or to our demand curve in the future, so I can\u2019t [indiscernible] with that. But things did get better in June and July of course."

We have a very, very small percentage of that market on HubSpot.

Our Net Promoter Score word of mouth is going way up. Our product organization really took a couple of steps back. It was really [indiscernible] right now.

What I\u2019m curious with CMS Hub is, what is some of the early feedback and learnings you\u2019re getting? Because where I\u2019m going with this, it seems like the Web\u2019s getting rebuilt.

You want to build the customer experience and that customer experience should be light and it should be modern and it should be the light bulb and you need a new type of CMS to pull that off, so you need to treat it like a first-class citizen, and that CMS has to be married to your CRM in [indiscernible].

The other thing I would say about HubSpot\u2019s Marketing Hub, it\u2019s not just marketing automation. I think a marketing automation is when people describe almost that old school middle of the funnel where you\u2019ve got the lead, you score the lead, you segment the lead, you do automation off that lead. HubSpot\u2019s Marketing Hub of course does all that stuff and really in a really elegant way. It does search engine optimization. You can do your advertising through it. You can do your social media through it. You can marry it with your Web site. You\u2019ve got [indiscernible] landing pages and your blog. It\u2019s much, much more than your garden variety marketing automation platform. So I\u2019m proud of the marketing team. They really innovated and banked on it.

We think it\u2019s sort of a bit of a new normal for us which we\u2019re excited about. The other thing that was a positive from our perspective is that it was not just in that sort of Starter Growth Suite where we saw some strength. The new customer adds were pretty strong across the board and we think that \u2013 as Brian highlighted says a lot about the value that our product is delivering. One thing that I would point out, we obviously saw the ASRPC drop quarter-over-quarter, not surprisingly. We talked about the fact that that was likely going to be the case on the last earnings call. And I think that you\u2019re seeing that for a couple of reasons. One is, that really significant traction that we\u2019re seeing at the low end of the portfolio is going to have sort of a natural mix impact there.

Many of the short-term discounts are 90 days in length, so customers would be starting to come out. And we have seen many of them progressing on a path toward more normal discount levels. Another play that we ran was around more flexible payment terms and that would mean that our customers are coming up and have a payment due, and we are all so pleased with the performance of those customers."

As companies have to move faster, maybe they want a solution that\u2019s simpler given that things are changing so fast. I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s created any differences in the conversations that you have or the win rates that you have when you\u2019re in a competitive situation where maybe buyer needs look a little different because the world looks a little different or what they\u2019re prioritizing is a little different, any color there would be interesting."

And I think it\u2019s just resonating well. I think our Marketing Hub Enterprise release we did in January worked and I think that CMS Hub Enterprise release we did in April is working. We\u2019ve always been really easy to use and we\u2019ve invested mass amounts in user research and design that\u2019s really paying off. And then we\u2019ve added a bunch of power and that\u2019s kind of the magic trick in itself.

And as Brian said, we were a bit frankly surprised that this pricing change resonated as much as it did with the market and we\u2019ve seen really strong adoption here. We talked a lot about what to do about the pricing and we are obviously looking very closely at the performance of those cohorts, and for now we\u2019re going to keep it. And we will continue to look closely, but at least for the near term here it\u2019s going to remain at $50."

            "I can take that. That\u2019s a great question. So when COVID first hit, obviously we had to get all our employees out of all of our offices and in their homes and set up. That was challenging but I think it went pretty well. I give a lot of credit to our people ops team and to our facilities team. All our ops teams did a great job of that. I think part of the reason it went pretty well, we were leaning towards remote. Remote was our third biggest office when COVID hit and we were trying to make that a more attractive option for new employees and for existing employees, and we were on top of that. I do think our culture is very strong. I think it\u2019s a real advantage for us. One of the things that we also saw \u2013 it\u2019s been certainly an interesting and challenging six months between the health crisis going on, the economic crisis and it\u2019s sort of been a crisis of conscience as well with all the stuff going on with Black Lives Matter. We\u2019re leaning hard in there. We feel like our employees really care about diversity inclusion as I do too and we would like to make progress there. So we\u2019ve been rolling out initiatives internally to, not just talk about that in the short term but try to really move the needle on that stuff. So our culture\u2019s still very much at our forefront. We feel like we\u2019ve built two products. We built a product that attracts great customers and retain them and we built a product that attracts great employees and retains them. We just call that product culture."

I think a lot of the questions that have been asked and answered are really focusing around this idea of how much of momentum you\u2019re seeing in June to July is tied to the promotional activity versus this idea there is something more durable happening in the industry around the shift to kind of online, the shift to digital, even remote work where perhaps you need to have a modern kind of marketing sales approach in the midmarket?

We\u2019re talking about moving from offline marketing to online, from outbound marketing to inbound marketing, from outside sales to inbound sales, from phone to flywheels [ph]. We\u2019ve been screaming from the hills. And our vision of the future for our customers that we thought we\u2019d take five or six more years. Like there\u2019s a lot of urgency around it. And I think digital transformation is a massive wave that\u2019s been going on for a long, long time. It just picked up a little steam here. And our products are well suited, our vision\u2019s well suited, our services organization is serving them well. We got a good community around this.

It is a sticky hard problem. It actually was not a problem we were particularly good at. It wasn\u2019t one of our primary colors. And so it\u2019s the perfect type of acquisition for us.

You are highlighting a trend that is real. We obviously saw some sharp headwinds due to the downgrade activity in Q2. And as the customers come off of short-term discounts and move towards more normal discounts, that is a tailwind to retention that will show up over the next few quarters. So from a near-term perspective, that should help."
