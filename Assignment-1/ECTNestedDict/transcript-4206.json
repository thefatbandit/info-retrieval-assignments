         "Thank you, Katie. Please turn to Slide 2 for a review of our Safe Harbor and non-GAAP statements. Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements as within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Projected financial information, including our guidance outlook, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, including those with respect to revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects, and other aspects of Daseke\u2019s business are based on management\u2019s current estimates, projections, and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections.",
         "I encourage you to read our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business and do not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.",
         "During the call, there will also be a discussion of some items that do not conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating ratio, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income or loss and free cash flow. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix to the investor presentation and press release issued this morning, both of which are available in the Investor tabs of the Daseke website, www. daseke.com.",
         "In terms of the structure of our call today, Chris will start with a review of our business operations and the progress we are making as we navigate through the pandemic environment and execute against our strategic priorities. Jason will then walk through the financial review of the quarter, and Chris will come back to wrap up with our remarks with a few closing comments before we open the line for questions.",
         "Now I would like to turn the call over to Daseke\u2019s CEO, Mr. Chris Easter. Chris?"
      ],
      "Chris Easter": [
         "Thank you, Brooks, and good morning, everyone. Slide 3 outlines a few of our key takeaways from the second quarter. In a quarter weighed down by COVID-19, I\u2019m pleased by the hard work, commitment, and solid execution by the entire Daseke family in the second quarter as we were able to deliver dramatically improved operating results year-over-year.",
         "The Daseke team achieved a 96.5% operating ratio. This was our best quarterly OR since the company was taken public more than three years ago and represents a year-over-year improvement of 250 basis points and was achieved in spite of COVID-19 headwinds.",
         "We also achieved a positive net income, which was a great accomplishment in the face of extremely challenging market conditions. The continued execution of our transformation actions, coupled with swift tactical cost actions in response to the pandemic related impacts were the key drivers of improvement.",
         "We launched the initial transformation actions last August, and I\u2019m pleased to announce that in less than a year, our team has turned around its performance from what was an accelerating decline and bottom line loss to a 96.5% OR and positive trajectory. I could not be prouder of what our team has accomplished in this short period, particularly considering the additional challenge of COVID-19.",
         "And what is even more exciting to our team is the fact that we are still just getting started in terms of our potential to deliver earnings improvement. I will touch more on this upside potential later in the call. It is also important to note the demonstrated resilience of our business model in this extreme environment.",
         "Our diverse portfolio of services, customers, and end markets served us well as end markets like wind energy, lumber and building materials held fairly steady through the quarter and are actually progressing ahead of last year. These verticals helped offset softness in other end markets that were materially impacted by COVID-19, like aerospace and metals. These offsetting end markets helped demonstrate the strength of our diversified portfolio model.",
         "Our resilience is further bolstered by the significant portion of brokerage and asset-light capacity across our portfolio. Having said that, we were not immune to the effects of the pandemic, as we saw volume declines, which negatively impacted our top line during the quarter. We experienced an immediate decline to our consolidated freight volumes, which troughed in April and then sequentially improved through May and June. As we look forward, we will continue to closely monitor our freight volumes and are confident in our ability to navigate through the market turbulence to a position of strength on the other side.",
         "During the second quarter, we also made significant progress on the strategic divestiture of our Aveda Transportation and Energy Services business. As a reminder, we announced the decision to sell the Aveda assets late last quarter. We did not make this decision lightly nor as a reaction to macro factors, but rather did so after undertaking proactive actions to better align the business\u2019 cost structure with the rest of our platform. However, at the end of the day, we decided that this business was not an ideal nor strategic long-term fit for our organization.",
         "In terms of our financial progress on the divestiture, we collected approximately $48 million in net proceeds from the sale of PP&E and the reduction in net working capital during the second quarter. We have completed the large majority of the work related to the divestiture of this business, but expect to fully complete it by the end of third quarter as previously disclosed.",
         "At the end of Q2, we had $4.9 million of PP&E that was still held for sale, but expect closing costs such as lease terminations and severance to fully offset any cash proceeds. Therefore, we\u2019d expect to see about a $7 million to $10 million in cash usage in the third quarter to complete the divestiture process. To reiterate our previous disclosure, when this process is complete, our exposure to the oil and gas end market will drop from roughly 13% of our historical revenue in 2019 to less than 2%.",
         "I\u2019ll end on this page with one of the bigger highlights of the second quarter, and that was the ongoing strengthening of our balance sheet. By continuing to drive strong free cash flows despite the pandemic as well as the sale of aforementioned non-core Aveda assets, we increased our cash position by nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter. This helped us lower our net debt and reduce our leverage ratio down to three times.",
         "We retained healthy liquidity with over $240 million available between our cash on hand and undrawn revolving credit facility. And we hope that the progress the team has achieved over the past year helps emphasize our company\u2019s ability to generate solid free cash flow above and beyond the onetime asset sales.",
         "Please turn to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll provide a few more details on our financial performance during the quarter. First, we had revenue of $352 million, which was down about 20% when compared to the same quarter in 2019. This was largely in line with our expectations, given the pushes and pulls of various end markets freight demand that I mentioned earlier. Additionally, nearly half of that decline came from the reduction in Aveda sales, which resulted from the sale of various components of its portfolio through the quarter.",
         "If you exclude Aveda, the core business revenue was down roughly 13%. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at $44 million for the quarter, down only 5%. However, when excluding Aveda, adjusted EBITDA was $45.8 million and was up 13% due to both our long \u2013 both our short-term and long-term cost containment efforts. The combination of strong operational cash flow generation and Aveda asset sales helped us generate $73 million in free cash flow during the period.",
         "Looking over the fullness of the last 12 months, we\u2019ve generated $175 million of free cash flow. That excess capital has allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing net debt by $118 million year-over-year and has also provided us with the resources we need to invest in our business, so we are prepared to exit the pandemic as a stronger niche market leader.",
         "Please turn to Slide 5. As I said earlier, roughly one year ago, we announced the foundation of our operational improvement plan and then accelerated that plan only two weeks later. In hindsight, those proactive efforts proved critical to our ability to not only navigate through this pandemic, but to do so from a position of strength.",
         "As you all know, we\u2019re in the middle of Phase II of the transformational program we outlined, and we remain on pace to achieve the $15 million improvement goal on a run rate basis as we enter fiscal 2021, in spite of the COVID-19 headwinds.",
         "Please turn to Slide 6. I think it\u2019s important that our investors understand that the hard work we\u2019ve been doing over the last year is not simply a cost exercise. We are building a stronger Daseke through this work. First, we\u2019re simplifying our business by reducing operating units from 16 to 9, and we are refining best practices, which can be applied in a cross-platform fashion.",
         "We continue to build out our leadership team, as I\u2019ve added Jason in April, and then we announced Rick Williams as our Chief Operating Officer in May. We are not being shortsighted about investing in our fleet either, evidenced by the fact we have lowered our average truck age to 3.4 years from 3.8 years at the start of this year.",
         "Finally, we are focused on increasing the utilization of all of our assets, which is particularly important in areas of our business that are more commodity driven, like our flatbed solutions. We are clearly seeing the results of our transformational efforts through our improved operating ratio. We have made great progress over the last few quarters, but we are not at all satisfied with our current OR and have significant room for continued improvement.",
         "With our simplified platform of nine operating companies, we are confident in our ability to continue to drive and improve OR from the 96.5% reported regardless of the market environment. We have several operating companies that operate at sub-90% operating ratios today. And through our continued operational excellence initiatives, we are working on the others. With Rick Williams moving into his new role as Chief Operating Officer during the second quarter, we are looking forward to the focus that he will bring to help maintain this momentum.",
         "With that, I will now turn the call over to Jason Bates to review our financial performance for the quarter. Jason?",
         "Thank you, Jason. I\u2019ll conclude on Slide 13 with our second half 2020 priorities. As we look forward, we\u2019re laser-focused on maintaining our momentum, just as we did in the first half of the year. We will continue to monitor and adjust our business to the realities of the economy, which will clearly see pushes and pulls from the pandemic. We will continue to prioritize the safety of our people, our customers, and our communities above all else. We\u2019ll also continue to focus internally on driving additional operations excellence across organization as we complete the remaining steps of Phase II of our operational improvement plan.",
         "Next, we\u2019ll continue to focus our efforts of operating our business effectively and efficiently to drive positive cash flow generation, which will allow us to continue to build financial strength and delever our balance sheet over the next few years. As we discussed, we do expect to use some cash in the third quarter related to final steps for the divestiture of the Aveda business and to support the CapEx we projected. But that should be partially offset by continued operational momentum.",
         "Lastly, we\u2019ll invest widely in our culture, our team, and our platform to emerge from this crisis as a stronger niche market leader that will have a strong set of growth opportunities ahead of it. We look forward to sharing our journey with all of you.",
         "This concludes our prepared remarks, and I\u2019m excited to turn the call back over to you for questions."

      "Jason Bates": [
         "Great. Thank you, Chris. Our Q2 2020 consolidated financial details are presented on Slide 7, both with and without the impact of Aveda. Given the strategic decision we have made to exit this business, we have provided this information to assist you in better analyzing and modeling our business on a go-forward basis.",
         "In the second quarter, revenue was $351.7 million, down 22% compared to $450.6 million in the year ago quarter. But as Chris mentioned, and as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, revenue was only down 13%, excluding Aveda. The decline was driven by lower volumes and freight rates in both our specialized and flatbed operating segments as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic weighed on our \u2013 weighed on industrial production and dampened demand in the quarter.",
         "Net income for the quarter was a positive $0.5 million, which after our preferred dividend equates to a loss of $0.01 per share, attributable to common stockholders. This GAAP earnings result compares favorably to a net loss of $6.4 million in the prior year quarter. This is another area where we see a real contrast when you exclude the impact of Aveda as our net income actually improved by $10 million year-over-year to a positive $5.1 million when we look at our core earnings results.",
         "Adjusted net income of $8 million grew meaningfully compared to adjusted net income of $3.4 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $43.7 million, down roughly 5% compared to $46 million in the year ago quarter. Again, excluding Aveda, adjusted EBITDA improved 13% to $45.8 million. This latter improvement highlights our team\u2019s strong operational performance in the quarter. This improvement was a result of our operational integration activity and cost improvement plans, which enabled us to overcome the general softening across the broader industrial space, which negatively impacted volumes and freight rates, as previously discussed.",
         "Before moving on to the operating segments, allow me to briefly touch on our corporate segment, which also improved its adjusted EBITDA versus last year\u2019s second quarter. As mentioned on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, this portion of our business is expected to benefit from cost containment efforts such as rightsizing of the executive staff as well as additional cost reduction initiatives taken to adapt to the global pandemic. As evidenced on the table, we were able to drive out an additional $2 million of corporate costs compared to last year\u2019s second quarter or an improvement of 17%.",
         "Moving on to a more detailed look at our segment results, starting with our specialized segment on Slide 8. For this business, given the ongoing divestiture process with the Aveda assets classified as held for sale, I will again speak to our reported headline results and then a more in-depth discussion of the segment pro forma for the Aveda divestiture.",
         "Specialized revenue in the second quarter decreased 21% year-over-year to $221.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter decreased 13% to $33 million, driven primarily by weakness in manufacturing and aerospace end markets in addition to continued pressure in oil and gas.",
         "Turning to Slide 9, where we detail our specialized segment results, ex Aveda. Revenue of $211.8 million, declined roughly 6% compared to the prior year period. Despite this top line pressure, adjusted EBITDA results of $35.2 million, grew by 9% versus the $32.3 million of adjusted EBITDA achieved in last year\u2019s second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 16.6%, grew by 230 basis points year-over-year. Notably, specialized operating ratio of a 90% OR, improved by 410 basis points versus last year\u2019s second quarter. The adjusted operating ratio was 89.5%, which also marks steady year-over-year improvement compared to 92% in the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Our specialized rate per mile increased roughly 5% to $3.05, up from $2.90 in the year ago quarter. While revenue per tractor increased a little more than 1% to $59,400. Improved profitability, as evidenced by the sub-90% OR and the 9% improvement in adjusted EBITDA in the face of a weaker top line environment was supported by certain wind energy projects, which have remained strong, while other key end markets see demand and revenues rebound from a broader-based macro weakness.",
         "As Chris alluded to earlier, we have a very diverse customer base with exposure to a wide array of industrial end markets, each of which are experiencing their own respective growth and economic recovery patterns. Additionally, we have a number of distinct embedded advantages in our business, which help provide further support and establish resilience to our financial results. This includes our highly unique equipment and deep technical operational knowhow and experience when serving the needs of customers in the specialized freight market.",
         "Moving to Slide 10, we detail our flatbed segment results for the quarter. Flatbed revenue in the second quarter decreased 22% to $137.2 million, driven by weaker volumes and freight rates stemming from the broader macroeconomic weakness. This was reflected in the more than 7% decline in the flatbed rate per mile, which declined to $1.80 per mile versus $1.94 in last year\u2019s second quarter. However, despite significant top line pressure, our segment adjusted EBITDA results of $20.4 million, grew 3% compared to the results of $19.9 million in the year ago quarter.",
         "This profitability improvement was driven by prior operational integrations and business improvement plans, which have driven out cost and enhanced efficiency across our operations. Those plans have helped us more than counteract the macro-related pressure on volumes and rates. The improved operational efficiency of this business has now begun to clearly manifest itself in our results as the flatbed segment operating ratio of 92.2% improved by 430 basis points, with adjusted operating ratio of 91.5%, improving 400 basis points, both when compared to the prior year.",
         "While we are proud of the progress our team members have realized thus far, we all recognize there is still a significant amount of additional upside in our business as well as a commensurate amount of collaboration and teamwork required to achieve it. We will continue to work towards completion of Phase II of our operational and cost improvement plans, which will help us drive further improvements to our financial results through continued cost discipline and demonstrating greater efficiency and productivity across our operations and assets.",
         "Now turning to our balance sheet and free cash flow metrics as detailed on Slide 11. As of June 30, Daseke had $157.3 million in cash and liquidity of $239.9 million, inclusive of the available borrowing capacity on the revolver, which still remains undrawn. Net debt decreased by $118 million year-over-year to $532.1 million. Our leverage, as defined in our debt agreements, as Chris alluded to as well, was at three times, well below our four times covenant.",
         "The chart on the right side of this slide is to help you understand our operating cash flows and CapEx through the first half of 2020. Through the first half of the year, net cash provided by operating activities was $82.9 million. Cash CapEx was $14.9 million and cash proceeds from the sale of equipment was $36.4 million. This resulted in free cash flow generation of $104.4 million. CapEx financed with debt or cap leases totaled $30 million, leaving you with a net of $74.4 million after financed CapEx for the first half of the year.",
         "Improving operating income and converting adjusted EBITDA into strong free cash flow has been a key focal point in our transformation. The emphasis we have put on this goal through overhauled operations and targeted cost eliminations is demonstrating itself in our cash returns as well as our leverage metrics. In fact, the weaker external economic environment has eliminated the impact of the transformational work we have undertaken over the last year as we\u2019ve been able to make progress towards our op income \u2013 toward our income improvement and deleveraging goals in the face of significant macro headwinds and broader-based economic uncertainty.",
         "Before we leave this page, I\u2019d like to reiterate the CapEx guide we provided last quarter as we continue to expect it to come in somewhere between $60 million to $65 million for fiscal year 2020.",
         "Turning now to Slide 12, you will see the clear impact that our transformational work has had on our balance sheet health. Enhanced operating cash flow generation has driven significant improvement in our cash balance, which has more than doubled since the second quarter of last year and grew more than 46% versus the first quarter after including proceeds from the asset divestitures.",
         "The critical takeaway here is that we\u2019re continuing to generate strong cash flow results on an operating level, we remain committed to continuing down our deleveraging path, all while maintaining, actually, while improving our balance sheet, as evidenced by our net debt reduction of close to $120 million year-over-year in the second quarter.",
         "So with that, I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Chris, where he will detail our outlook and priorities for the second half of the year."

            "Thank you, operator. Hey, Chris, hey Jason, hey team. I wanted to focus a little bit, the first question on the longer term, right? You\u2019re sort of ahead, I think, of everyone\u2019s expectations in your cost takeouts. And that\u2019s during an extremely difficult operating environment. Some would argue that this quarter might have been one of the most difficult given how the pandemic really swung around sort of that demand complex that you always look at. I\u2019m wondering sort of longer term, how should we look at your company\u2019s ability to push that OR even lower? And sort of what are your goals for the, let\u2019s say, next three years?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks Jason. Appreciate it. And, yes, it was a challenging quarter. And \u2013 but I think the opportunity for us to improve was clearly evident and we continue to execute. And when I think about the longer term, and we put that 90% number down there, and we do see that type of potential in the future over the next several years. We\u2019ve made great progress in 12 months toward that end, and we\u2019ve got a lot of work left to do. And we\u2019re impatient to achieve that. We\u2019ve executed on the plans to date. But as we look to, maybe into 2021 and beyond, we do see additional leverage we can pull and work toward that.",
            "And again, the underlying our business model as it is today is where we kind of frame up that 90% potential, our mix of asset, asset-light brokerage. So I think that\u2019s important to note too. But in our current model and our mix of business, we certainly see that type of potential for the long-term and we\u2019re going to be working toward that end."

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So, I mean, I think it\u2019s important. Just real quick, I was just going to touch on one thing to add on to Chris\u2019 comment there. I think it\u2019s important to understand and I think this year, this quarter specifically, demonstrates that Daseke is largely a self-help story, at least in the short-term. We have a lot of levers that we can pull, that we don\u2019t need a gigantic macroeconomic recovery for us to continue to make progress. And I think that definitely is not lost on you as you kind of highlighted in your opening comments. But I think that there\u2019s still a lot more meat on that bone for us, and we\u2019re going to continue to execute and drive towards that 90% OR over the long run.",
            "Getting back to your second question about CapEx. I think when we look at our business, we want to make sure that we\u2019re continually investing. We\u2019re bringing that average age down. And I think it\u2019s important to understand too, Daseke is a little different in terms of the composition of the assets. Some of these specialized assets have longer lives. And so the CapEx investment cycles for those is a little bit different.",
            "I think it\u2019s probably safe to say, we haven\u2019t built out our full kind of CapEx \u2013 replacement CapEx plans. But we \u2013 I think at the outset of this year, we were kind of saying in that 70% to 75% range, kind of on a replacement CapEx basis. And I\u2019m looking down the table to John, who\u2019s our resident expert on this front. I think that that\u2019s probably a good starting point as you model out next year and going forward. But I\u2019ll turn it over to John to add any color he might have."

            "Great question. We\u2019ve actually been having some pretty healthy internal debates about this topic over the last few weeks because I will say that, that number, that 3.4 is a little deceptive, kind of getting back to the point I just alluded to. And so we\u2019re looking at working with our operating companies to kind of get a little bit more granularity and visibility into maybe bifurcating the asset classes so that there\u2019s more transparency for all of you.",
            "So you can kind of see when you look at our kind of core over-the-road trucks, what\u2019s our average age versus some of these specialized assets that sometimes we\u2019ll hold on to for six, seven, eight years or some of our kind of local or regional stuff that had longer live. I would tell you, we still have a little bit of room to go on that overall weighted average. I think we want to see that number probably get a little closer to that three, the kind of low 3s. But again, it\u2019s going to depend on the mix of that specialized versus traditional kind of flatbed business.",
            "So we have a little bit of room to go on that front, and we\u2019re committed to continuing to invest. And we\u2019ve got plans in place to keep driving that down. And here, over the coming quarters, as we get a little bit more granularity from the opco level up, we\u2019ll look at kind of bifurcating that for you guys, so you have a little bit more visibility on that."

Chris, I think you talked about many of the pushes and pulls in the economy in the quarter. I was wondering if you can give us a little more meat on the bone, talking about some of the areas that you see that are coming back in terms of your end markets and your expectations for the second half of the year in terms of demand?

But as we \u2013 as I alluded to in our comments earlier, though, the lumber segment has been very strong. And we would \u2013 we right now are expecting that to continue to be strong. Wind energy continues to be strong as well. Some areas that actually have bounced back a little bit, and defense has actually come back a little bit. As COVID hit hard early, there were some shutdowns in some of that area, that has rebounded somewhat. But other areas like aerospace, we\u2019re not optimistic we\u2019re going to see any upside on that anytime soon, but it\u2019s pretty much fully cooked in our current run rate, as is the metals.",

I\u2019ve been in the industry for a long time, but it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve really had such a diversified end market exposure, and it\u2019s actually really nice because it does kind of counterbalance. And that\u2019s one of the unique benefits of the Daseke portfolio model is that you do have that kind of \u2013 it ebbs and flows oftentimes in different cycles, and it provides a little bit more stability. So as we continue to focus on kind of pulling the levers we can, I don\u2019t want to say we\u2019re insulated from, but we\u2019re somewhat insulated from the extreme volatility that some of the other kind of retail heavy companies are exposed to."

Now we\u2019ve kind of reached a plateau and it\u2019s just moving sideways. As we\u2019re looking forward in the quarter, again, there are some pushes and pulls in the different segments.

We\u2019ve actually got that key.

And that trend is something that kind of speaks. It kind of plateaued a little bit here in the back half of June and into July. And you\u2019ve got holiday, with the July 4 holiday.

I think the \u2013 we \u2013 one thing we communicated last quarter, I\u2019d reiterate again this quarter is, we\u2019re in a position of strength and resilience with the cash we\u2019ve got on hand, we will navigate despite the depth or breadth of downturn or if there\u2019s a second incremental downturn to come, which we don\u2019t see that at this point. But if there were, we\u2019re in a position to navigate through it. I would say that there are peers out there that may not be in that type of a position of strength. I think a lot of the smaller carriers out there, which \u2013 many of which are in our space, right?",
            "That\u2019s our primary competitors, are $30 million, $10 million, $40 million companies that are out there. And there are some great operators out there, but do they all have the ability to be resilient through this type of a situation. And some of them might have between a couple of helps, like maybe there\u2019re some governmental help, I think, in some cases, that are helping some of these folks get through it. But if that\u2019s not sustainable, then some of those might exit.",
            "All that said, my view is, I think we\u2019re going to see some tightening of capacity. And it will ride itself to the demand. And we\u2019re in a position to get through that fine. And we also are seeing decreased turnover from a driver perspective. We actually finished the quarter at total turnover right around 60%. We typically outperform our large for-hire carriers significantly on turnover. I think, Jason, from your experience as well. And this quarter was an improvement over the previous year. I think we were at about a 63% Q2 of last year. We\u2019re down to about 60% for this quarter. So we\u2019re seeing great \u2013 lower turnover numbers and an ability to get drivers as we\u2019re going forward, too. So anything to add on to it."

I mean, all of our crystal balls are a little bit fuzzy right now. So there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there, but we\u2019re preparing for a spectrum of possibilities.

And we want to make sure that we \u2013 when we do something that we do it in such a way that it makes a lot of sense and it\u2019s strategic and it opens doors.

But at the same time, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see us sit here and accumulate $200 million, $300 million, $400 million of cash and just sit on it, right, especially when we\u2019ve got debt. So that doesn\u2019t make sense either.",
            "So it\u2019s a long answer to your short question, but hopefully it helps you understand a little bit how we\u2019re thinking about it, how we\u2019re evaluating all of the options that are out there. And we\u2019re going to make the right \u2013 we\u2019re going to let the math guide us, right? Whatever \u2013 we want to preserve optionality, but also make the right decision for the shareholders, for the lenders and ultimately for the employees as well."

            "Thank you, Katie. The COVID-19 outbreak is a crisis for everyone. And last August, we had to completely reexamine every part of our business from top to bottom and figure out which levers we could pull and should pull. We built the playbook resulting \u2013 sorry, including this downside playbook, which means we know what we should do and what glass we should break scenarios and what responses we could exercise if needed. We reduced our fleets, improved earnings, and prioritized our cash flow and cash balances. We had all the tools in the toolkit and we\u2019re using these now. We remain focused on the long-term price and believe we have a solid path to both navigate today\u2019s challenges and thrive to take care \u2013 advantage of tomorrow\u2019s opportunities.",
