         "Our next presentation, we are pleased to welcome Kimberly-Clark. When Mike Hsu stepped in his CEO role, it was through a clear succession plan. But it didn\u2019t seem that there was going to be strategic change coming as well. And yet over the past several months we\u2019ve seen a more growth-oriented mindset clearly take hold and in particular a real focus on end-market execution. ",
         "Today, we have Mike and also CFO, Maria Henry with us. They are going to go through some prepared remarks and then I\u2019ll host a Q&A session. So, Mike and Maria, I\u2019ll pass it over to you. "

      "Mike Hsu ": [
         "Okay. Thank you, Lauren. Thank you for having us and I hope you and certainly everyone on this call are staying healthy and safe. I would like to spend a few minutes highlighting our priorities in the current environment, especially our recent results and our medium-term strategies. ",
         "The standard reminders apply today about any forward-looking statements that we make and any reference to non-GAAP financial measures. So, we refer you to our latest 10-K and website for any further information. ",
         "Our four key messages for today; one, we are prioritizing the health and safety of our people and our consumers. We are executing our strategies well. We are delivering excellent financial results and we are very optimistic about our opportunities to generate long-term growth and create shareholder value. ",
         "Now we have three operating priorities in the current environment and we are managing them well. First and foremost, we are focused on the health and safety of our employees and our consumers and throughout our 148 year history, this has never been more important than it is right now. ",
         "Second, we are proactively managing our global supply chain to ensure supply of our essential products and our teams have done a great job keeping our supply chain rolling and we haven\u2019t had any really material disruptions to-date. And third, we are prudently managing the business to near-term volatility while continuing to strengthen the long-term health of Kimberly-Clark. ",
         "Now, we introduced K-C Strategy 2022 in January of last year leading up to the company\u2019s 150th anniversary in 2022. The plan will enable us to deliver balanced and sustainable growth and has really three strategies; accelerate growth of our portfolio of iconic brands; leverage cost and financial discipline to fund growth and improve margins; and allocate capital in value-creating ways. The strategy is working and we remain committed to it. ",
         "K-C 2022 will enable us to achieve our medium-term financial objectives. Our top-line objective is to grow sales and organic sales 1% to 3% annually and we are striving to be in the upper half of that range. On the bottom-line, our objective is to increase EPS mid-single-digits annually. We expect to deliver solid operating profit growth and we\u2019ll reinvest in marketing to fill the top-line, which we\u2019ve been doing over the past 18 months. ",
         "Our objective is to at least maintain our top-tier ROIC and we are targeting dividend increases generally in line with EPS growth. We believe a strong dividend is an important part of our investment proposition. Longer-term, we are optimistic about the potential of our categories and our business to grow at faster rates. We made good progress executing K-C 2022 last year. ",
         "Organic sales were up 4%, driven by selling price increases and strong market execution. And that success from the top-line enable us to achieve mid-single-digit growth and adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. ROIC also improved nicely. ",
         "Through the first half of this year our results have been outstanding and in July, we reinstated guidance and raised our outlook for the full year. The increase in our organic sales outlook reflects a combination of improved underlying brand performance and higher demand in consumer tissue because of COVID-19. The high organic sales along with increased cost savings enabled us to also raise our outlook for operating profit and earnings.",
         "And importantly, we also raised our branding capability investments to keep our top-line momentum going. To accelerate growth, we are sharpening our focus on the consumer and we are driving against two consumer-centric growth pillars, elevate the core and accelerate growth in D&E markets. To execute that strategy, we are deploying a disciplined approach to invest and build commercial capability in the four areas as you can see on this slide. ",
         "We are applying greater focus, driving more enterprise scale and improving execution and this is similar to how we approach cost management over the years. We are elevating our core by delivering premium innovation, that solve bigger problems for consumers and make our brands worth more. And I\u2019ll touch on the three examples. ",
         "Last summer, we launched Huggies Special Delivery, our most premium diaper in the U.S. This diaper includes naturally sourced materials and has achieved about one point of market share even with limited distribution. ",
         "We are currently launching Pull-Ups New Leaf in the U.S., which also features super soft natural materials and is the most premium Training Pants in the market. ",
         "Outside the U.S., we have our Huggies Nature Made line-up in South Korea. We\u2019ve launched numerous high-end offerings here including a super premium Nature Made organic product that we launched last year. Our diaper sales in South Korea now nearly has super premium. ",
         "We are also pivoting rapidly to pursue new growth opportunities related to health, wellness and protection, both at home and in the workplace. In Consumer, we are launching Kleenex proactive care in the UK and other EMEA markets. This includes hand towels, anti-bacterial hand and face wipes, sanitizing gel and face masks. ",
         "These products will help protect consumers where they are most vulnerable on their skin when they touch surfaces and in the air. ",
         "In K-C Professional, we recently launched new masks that feature our superior nonwovens technology. We\u2019ll also be expanding our wipers line-up including Scott 24, which delivers 24 hour protection from bacteria. ",
         "Now let me turn to D&E markets where our biggest long-term growth opportunities exist. Looking specifically at diapers, D&E is where 90% of the world\u2019s babies are born where GDP per capita and the middle-class are expanding and where penetration and frequency are growing. ",
         "In 2019, the size of the diaper category in D&E was $31 billion that was up from $20 billion just a decade ago. And yet, the average spending per baby in D&E is only about 15%, that\u2019s one five, 15% of the U.S. level. As the graphic shows, significant category potential exists as that spending rate increases over time. ",
         "Now while we may not see a $100 billion category in our lifetime. These markets are developing just as China has done significantly over the last 30 years. So we are investing to build these markets and accelerate growth. We are investing in our brands, innovations and commercial capability. We are also placing strong emphasis on category building, marketing and relative market strategies. ",
         "We are obviously also investing in D&E through M&A. And just last week, we announced the $1.2 billion acquisition of Softex in Indonesia. This transaction is a perfect strategic fit with our focus on accelerating growth in personal care and D&E. This acquisition significantly expands our presence in Indonesia and that includes the diaper category in which we don\u2019t compete today. ",
         "The diaper market in Indonesia is already the sixth largest in the world. It\u2019s been growing at double-digit rates and is expected to continue growing strongly for a long time. So Softex had sales of about $420 million last year, all in personal care and about 18% of which were in diapers. They\u2019ve built a strong business with double-digit growth, solid profitability and strong market positions. ",
         "So this transaction really improves our underlying growth prospects and we are really excited about leveraging our successful D&E growth strategies on the Softex brands. ",
         "Consistent with K-C Strategy 2022, we are also accelerating our advertising investment to fuel market share momentum and better position us for sustainable long-term success. So we increased our spending on advertising by about 60 basis points in 2019 and we expect to exceed that rate of increase this year. Our focus is on digital where our ROIs are higher. Our spending on digital is approximately two-thirds of our overall paid media spending. ",
         "Our advertising is targeted to support innovation launches and also build brand equity and these marketing strategies are paying off, both in terms of top-line growth and market shares and in fact, we are tracking to improve or maintain share this year in about 60% of our category country combinations. ",
         "Now to fund all that investment and help grow the bottom-line, cost savings remain a core strategy for us and so we are executing two savings programs. The first is FORCE, which is our longstanding ongoing program. FORCE is focused on improving our end-to-end supply chain leveraging our global supply chain organization. ",
         "The second program is our 2018 global restructuring and this is our biggest ever restructuring and it\u2019s lowering our structural cost base by streamlining our overhead and our supply chain costs. For 2020, we are targeting more than $0.5 billion in combined savings from both of these programs. ",
         "Now, we also have a longstanding commitment to return cash to shareholders as a part of our shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. So we paid a dividend 86 years in a row and increased the dividend for 48 consecutive years. In the last ten years, we\u2019ve increased our dividend per share by more than 60% and over that decade, we paid out more than $23 billion in cash to shareholders between dividends and share repurchases. ",
         "We\u2019ve also been focused on sustainability for long time and we made excellent progress, which you can read about in our 17th Annual Sustainability Report. Now we recently launched the next phase of our journey which we call them Sustainability 2030. ",
         "By 2030, we expect to advance the well-being of 1 billion people through social programs and we plan to reduce our environmental footprint by half with a focus on plastics, water, carbon and FORCE. We are strongly committed to sustainability and are really proud of our track record. ",
         "So, in closing, we are making excellent progress in delivering strong performance this year. We are investing to position K-C for long-term success. We are driving balance and sustainable growth through K-C Strategy 2022 and we are confident in our ability to create long-term shareholder value. ",
         "So with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to you Lauren. And Maria and I will be happy to take any questions that you might have. "

            "Great. Okay. Good. I got the video back on. Mike and Maria, you can put your video back on, that will be great. Perfect. Mike is sitting in the dark. Okay, perfect. So, Mike, your presentation noted, you clearly have continued optimism in the long-term potential to categories and your business. ",
            "I\u2019d love to get a sense for how some of the things you are doing on the growth front, the investments, the focus on capabilities, people, how that ties into those longer term growth aspirations? And also, how does category conditions through including projections for declining birth rates in the U.S., faster into your longer term thinking? "

      "2": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Well, one, I would say, overall, and I think the long-term thesis for us is that that we are still in the very early innings of category development of our categories globally, but especially in leading markets. And so, we are really driving K-C 2022 because we believe that will enable us to unlock faster growth. That\u2019s only in D&E. ",
            "I think we talked about Indonesia, that\u2019s just one of the markets, but certainly if you think about it, I think we are \u2013 I would characterize this is only being of a second inning of a game in D&E markets. For example, China is the world\u2019s largest diaper market today, but that market, the category of China will likely at least double or probably triple over the next ten or twenty years. ",
            "Similarly, as we talked about with Indonesia, today it\u2019s the sixth largest diaper market, but over the next ten years, we expect it will become the third largest diaper market more than triple over that time period. Once you get past those two highly developed ones now, that may have India and Africa and there is many other markets that are coming up be with some occur on top of that. ",
            "So that\u2019s one part of our strategy, which is to expand our presence in developed markets and develop in emerging markets. The other, we still think there is a lot of opportunities for us to premiumized markets in developed markets, along with the mentions of comfort, health which is critical in this COVID environment, natural organic or sustainable and providing those offerings that make our brands worth more. ",
            "So we are excited about both those opportunities and then, Lauren, the way that I think you\u2019ve observed over time that we are really trying to drive that execution is really a systematic approach which we are calling kind of commercial capability and that really encompasses innovation, marketing or digital marketing, specialty, sales execution and then revenue management for us.

So, if you could talk a little bit about some of the capabilities you are hoping to develop and even have these two newer positions and how these two people kind of fit in with that that broader senior leadership team that you\u2019ve really put together in the last, I guess, now almost three years?

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I \u2013 we have actually made a lot of thoughtful changes in the leadership team. I probably didn\u2019t realize how expensive it was until you raised that question. So, it was, I think out of 13 directs, I think we had 11 that are in different roles. And I would say, I am really proud of the leadership team. I think we have a diverse and collaborative leadership team and our recent addition that you know are bringing, I think really world-class experiences, at the same time, leveraging strong K-C competencies. ",
            "And what we are really focused on Alison\u2019s words are \u2013 is, we are really trying to build powerhouse capability here. So, we have made a lot of changes. I think the key attributes that we\u2019ve been looking for in our leadership around, we are really having strong conviction, our brand building mentality and that\u2019s one piece. ",
            "Second, deep expertise in their core area and then, the critical last piece is, highly collaborative and I think we really have that leadership team right now. ",
            "Now, with the recent additions, I would say, I think we are pretty fortunate between Allison, Zena Arnold who is our Chief Digital Marketing Officer. Gustavo Ghory, who just joined us as our Chief - Global Chief Supply Officer, really bring that expertise and as I think you well know, Russ Torres, who joined our K-C Professional business. He came off from the outside, as well, really a strong seasoned operator with a lot of experience in different types of categories. ",
            "Just to kind of give you an example of Allison, I think she was in a similar role at JNJ and then in a similar role at Coca-Cola before that. So she brings really world-class experience from world-class companies. And I\u2019ll tell you a funny story. I had just made the offer and I\u2019ve got positive signals and then I was at a top meeting at the Silicon Valley with Google. ",
            "And so, we were having a great meeting with Google and they said, \u201chey, you guys are really a great partner, but just that your \u2013 we are clear Mike, you are not the best\u201d. And so, hopefully, we can call you one of our best partners by this time next year.",
            "And just for reference, our best partner will be presenting in our Google Live Conference and that\u2019s a woman named Allison Lewis. And I was thinking of myself, well, I hope it\u2019s the same presenter next year. So, I do think she does bring a wealth of experience, whether it\u2019s digital, or fundamental brand marketing or insight development. ",
            "And she started to bring that change to our team. And you\u2019ll know Zena, who has great experience, who actually came and joined us from Google where she was running the Chrome Books business most recently but Craig Christenson as well, who has great experience particularly in D&E markets, our global category leader on Baby and Child Care right now, had joins us from deep experience and I think he spent the majority of his career in Japan and Istanbul and so he is really focused on building out international markets. And so, we are really excited about that capability. ",
            "Similarly, I think the overall theme that I get from Zena, Gustavo was \u2013 well, there is some really strong capability and some really great tools. I think Gustavo pointed out in manufacturing like we have some world-class tools and so I give you an A on some of that or I give the team a C or maybe a D is what we are not great at standardizing or rolling out those tools broadly across markets. And that\u2019s some discipline that I think Allison and Gustavo will bring from a functional perspective. So, I\u2019ll pause there. Any additional to answer your questions there. "

         "Remarks": [
            "No, no. That\u2019s great. Let me just give us a little bit, I want \u2013 you want to talk more about Softex and maybe Maria, you could take this one. So, you gave us some statistics on the size of the market already. But I was curious about kind of GDP per capita, how that ties into diaper category development? ",
            "And then also, Maria, just profitability in particular, my sense is that Softex has pretty attractive profitability. But I wanted to just understand if you move that their mainstream whether that profit profile should remain sustainable as you invest to grow the business, so it would be great if you could answer those? "

         "Speaker": "Lauren Lieberman"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Sure. We are very excited about the Softex acquisition as Mike talked about and Lauren, you heard me say for years now that we do have an M&A group. We do look at everything that moves. So it\u2019s nice that we were able to find an asset that is sort of perfect overlap with our strategy and 100% of the revenues are in the personal care categories that we are looking to expand in the D&E markets. ",
            "So, really great strategic fit as a company and Mike talked about some of the highlights of the company itself, but when you look at the Indonesian market, as you mentioned today the GDP per capita is about $4,000 that a great point in a diaper category, kind of an inflection point, because it takes about $4,000 to $5,000 GDP per capita to come into the categories and then as that grows the usage grows over time and China is a great benchmark for that. ",
            "When we look at where China was ten years ago, I think it was 4,500 GDP per capita. Today it\u2019s over 10,000 and we\u2019ve seen the rapid growth in China diaper market tripling over that same period of time. So, it\u2019s kind of a perfect time to get into the Indonesian market given that it\u2019s at a bit of an inflection point. ",
            "In terms of their GDP per capita in Indonesia is expected to double over the same period of time and as Mike mentioned, the \u2013 in terms of the size of the diaper market, it\u2019s expected to go from the sixth largest diaper market today to the third largest diaper market in the world by 2030. ",
            "So, really, really strong growth market, growth potential with a rate macroeconomics looking at it in the perfect strategic overlap. It\u2019s also a very well run company and has good profitability as a company. It\u2019s \u2013 there are a few things that we\u2019ll need to do to it. ",
            "We will need to add a bit of cost around transitioning it from a standalone Indonesian company into a part of our portfolio as a global U.S. based business. That\u2019s all been incorporated into our models. We will look to preserve the way that they operate the company today. ",
            "So, they\u2019ve been able to craft a very successful functional company on a low cost structure and we will look to preserve that. The majority of where we\u2019ll be having synergies on the field are on the revenue side, more so than the cost side where we have some expertise that we can bring that can fuel and continue to accelerate the growth on Softex. ",
            "So, good company, well run, profitable, and we\u2019ll look to continue that as we move forward. And from a shareholder value creation standpoint, this deal has strong double-digit returns and we believe there is a winner for shareholder value creation over the long-term. "

         "Remarks": [
            "Great. And so, I am going to switch gears entirely and I can talk a bit about the U.S. First thing was just going to be, you have seen projections for declines in the U.S. birth rate in 2020 and probably for the next few years, I guess, all dependent on how COVID persists and so on and the resulting recession. ",
            "So, Mike or Maria, either one of you who want to take this, just how should we factor that this softened U.S. birth rate into the projections for the next year or two, three, whatever the appropriate conversation that is the question we\u2019d be getting increasingly from investors. "

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Lauren, we are hearing the same, same, although we haven\u2019t seen the data yet. And the last set of data that we had on birth rate was actually a slight improvement at the beginning of this year. I think the category, the births have been down, I think the prior year or so about 2% and I think we have seen an improvement that to be down 1%. ",
            "And \u2013 but I read the same articles that say, that predict an appropriate decline, I also read some articles that say, \u201chey, given everybody being at home that you should see your birth rate pick up as well\u201d . But in either case, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything in the data thus far. If you look at the last four weeks, there has been a little stock up, destock effect in child care, but in the last four weeks, that category was up about 2% overall in revenue. ",
            "So, kind of about where it had been historically, I think over time. That said, I think we feel very good about our business. Our business is performing well. Our team is doing a great job driving the Elevate strategy on Huggies. And I think that\u2019s driving the category up and our customers are really supporting this strategy. So we feel good about kind of what we are right now. "

But, the last time that there was a sustained decline in the birth rate, I mean, Kimberly-Clark\u2019s personal care business in North American crew right through that and arguably with less growth-focused strategy. So, not a lot of unprecedented I guess has been a big factor too. "

It\u2019s funny thing when I \u2013 I\u2019d actually just spoke to the \u2013 our Baby and Child Care General Manager or President last couple of days ago, and so well, well, we are driving it. The good news is there is no silver bullet. ",
            "It\u2019s not any one thing and I would just say it\u2019s good, it\u2019s really a kind of a hallmark at the commercial transformation or commercially building works, which is we\u2019ve got very strong innovation on Tier 5 and 6. We feel that we have the best products out there. She rolled out a really strong improvement on our value tier or sun and dry business from a product dimension earlier this year. And then, really strong advertising, we kind of refreshed the advertising and are receiving really strong customer support. So, overall, I think it\u2019s just a good fundamental blocking and tackling. "

So, if you could just update us maybe on current demand trends in the consumer tissue business in the U.S.? And outlook for the pricing and promotional landscape and then, how long do you think it will take to get retail inventory levels back to kind of appropriate sustainable levels? "

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Well, obviously, Lauren, as you recall, there is definitely robust stock up impacts that affected us in the first half. We are certain to see demand normalize \u201cnormalize\u201d across in all markets in U.S., but I would say, it\u2019s up our other developed markets as well in Western Europe, Korea, Australia, New Zealand. But just to focus in a little bit on the U.S., I think the numbers in the U.S. on back tissue I think it last four weeks back, it was up 3%. ",
            "Okay, so that\u2019s an increase, but it\u2019s less than the 200% that we saw in a few weeks in March. So that was up 3%. Towels, still growing and you can understand why, but that was up 15% in the last four weeks. So, but overall, I would say, we are expecting to see consumer tissue demand higher for the year, but stabilize versus where we had \u2013 versus where it has been. ",
            "I think we are making strong progress from replenishment perspective. We are getting our customers back into inventory. There was quite a drain through the first half, but I think we gained on it in the second quarter a bit and I think we will make more progress in the third quarter. But I think it will take us all of the third quarter three and probably a chunk at quarter four to get our customers back into the position they really want to be. ",
            "I mean, the net of it is, I think, the reality is, I think consumers are going to use more in tissue, just because the more the people are at home, they are going to be using more. They are going to want to carry a little bit more inventory, that\u2019s just the natural consumer behavior. And then, and the retailers are also going to want to carry little bit more inventory. ",
            "So, we should \u2013 we are still working through all that inventory effect, but we are still catching up to it. I will say, we are pulling out all the stuff to get our customers back into position. I was meeting with a large \u2013 one of our largest retailers and I was telling that we are doing this, and they said, \u201cWell, it can\u2019t be too profitable to be shipping back tissue from Korea\u201d I said, no it\u2019s not. But we are doing everything we can to get our customers back in surface. "

            "Okay. Great. And then, I sneak in one more question. I\u2019ve got two minutes left. So within KCP, that was really product that you are launching in the UK, kind of Kleenex brand. So, I guess, one question would be, you thought doing something like that in the U.S. and maybe talk a little bit about things you might be doing on the KCP side around safety. ",
            "And I guess, the degree to with some of those opportunities from a scale perspective would lead the totality of the washroom business. I think we have to think about washroom being impaired to some degree for a period of time. How much of that gap can be made up? "

            "Yes. So the \u2013 I\u2019d say, the consumer line of Kleenex proactive care, we are launching in Europe, it will go into other markets. We are probably not ready to share exactly which ones yet. But what we are doing that. But we are really excited about that and I think \u2013 and Lauren, I think we may have talked about this before. But there are plenty of wipes for surface care. ",
            "But there is not any really good wipes for your skin. And so, those are some of the things we are working on and obviously, given that we have babies wipe \u2013 baby wipe business that we think we can do a great job there. So, I think on the consumer side, that there is an opportunity for us to serve what an important consumer need around personal protection. ",
            "And then similarly, Russ who is our President, our Global K-C professional business, really in his discussions with his customers, hygiene and protection become mission-critical for those customers and end-users to remain operate. And so, he has worked with his leadership team to make an aggressive pivot. And so, there is a couple of areas, definitely the core washroom business pulled down just because occupancy like in hotels and travels is pulled down, office usage is down. ",
            "So, we are going to see those kinds of declines. But we are making the shift. Certainly, we are getting a lot of momentum around conversion from jet air dryers which tend to spread germs into \u2013 back into our towels business. And so, we are excited about that. But we are also beyond that, I think there is a better offering for us to offer more protection, just similar to Kleenex proactive care on the consumer side, but also we are driving wipers growth and we are expanding our line of pre-saturated wipers. ",
            "We\u2019ve got a line of \u2013 we call it, Scott 24, which keeps germs or bacteria off surfaces for up to 24 hours. And then we did start producing masks and it turns out, we are one of the world\u2019s largest nonwovens producers in the world and we invented the material that is used for N-95 masks and because of that, we feel like we have an advantage in the material result. ",
            "And we got into some mask production primarily to serve our own needs, but we are getting quite a bit of demand from the external world and we are trying to fulfill that demand, as well. "
