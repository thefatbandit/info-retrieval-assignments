         "Thank you, and welcome to Invesco Mortgage Capital\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings call. The management team and I are delighted you\u2019ve joined us, and we look forward to sharing with you our prepared remarks and conducting a question and answer session.",
         "Before turning the call over to our CEO, John Anzalone, I wanted to provide a reminder that statements made in this conference call and the related presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management\u2019s expectations about future events and our overall plans and performance.

Invesco makes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.",
         "We may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures during today\u2019s call. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures may be found at the end of our earnings presentation. ",

      ],
      "Brian Norris": [
         "Thanks Kevin, and good morning to everyone listening to the call.",
         "As John mentioned, the latter half of the first quarter and extending well into the second quarter proved to be a tremendously challenging environment for the company. Our team worked extremely hard towards the goal of reducing the company\u2019s reliance on short-term mark-to-market financing for our credit assets as well as overall company leverage. To that end, by early May we successfully reduced our reliance on credit repo to zero with current overall company leverage below 0.8 times debt to equity.",
         "With over $1 billion of equity, we believe we are well positioned to reconstruct a portfolio that can offer investors compelling returns and dividend income. We have reengaged agency RMBS repo and interest rate swap counterparties to build the necessary capacity to prudently invest proceeds from a further reduction in credit exposure as our credit assets continue to recover from the liquidity-induced sell-off in the first quarter. Given current and past Fed support and the enduring availability of agency RMBS repo through multiple crises in the financial markets, moving forward we anticipate the asset class will the primary use of capital to achieve the company\u2019s longstanding goals of providing attractive dividend income and book value stability.",
         "We believe we can reliably achieve low double-digit ROEs with a mixture of agency RMBS specified pools in addition to a modest allocation to TBA securities. Fed intervention has fostered an attractive investment environment. While we plan to transition from the current portfolio which is almost exclusively credit investments to an agency-focused strategy in the coming quarters, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to achieve targeted returns on credit investments without reliance on short-term mark-to-market funding. ",
         "Lastly, our external manager, Invesco remains committed to devoting the necessary resources to the company. Invesco enjoys a long history of managing the agency RMBS asset class and many of our team members have supported the trading and management of the agency RMBS allocation in IVR since the IPO in June 2009. Combined, our team members have over 80 years of experience managing the asset class through multiple market cycles and crises with over $23 billion of agency RMBS assets under management as of 12/31/2019. ",
         "That ends our prepared remarks, and now we will open the line for Q&A."
      ],
      "John Anzalone": [
         "Good morning and welcome to Invesco Mortgage Capital\u2019s first quarter earnings call. I will give some brief comments before turning the call over to our President and Head of Commercial Credit, Kevin Collins, who will provide greater detail on our current portfolio, and our Chief Investment Officer, Brian Norris, who will expand on our go-forward strategy. ",
         "Before getting started, I\u2019d like to acknowledge the entire team at Invesco who have put in countless hours managing through this crisis and doing it with the added difficulty of working remotely. There is no way that we would be in the position we are in today without their efforts, so thank you to the entire team. I\u2019d also like to acknowledge the support of both our Board of Directors and the senior management at Invesco who have provided all of the resources necessary to get through this crisis. ",
         "Towards the end of the first quarter, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic shutdown left in its wake caused unprecedented volatility and dislocation throughout the financial markets. Even with rates rallying significantly, prepaid protected specified pool agency mortgage-backed securities significantly underperformed as agency paper was being sold for cash settle at levels below TBA prices. The structured securities and credit markets were hit particularly hard as liquidity was severely impacted and valuations became distressed. ",
         "Despite IVR\u2019s relatively strong liquidity position coming into the crisis, we sold assets as margin calls accelerated across all of our asset classes. In late March, we decided to discontinue selling our holdings into a deeply distressed market to meet margin calls, so we suspended margin payments and entered forbearance negotiations with our lenders. Ultimately, we were able to capitalize on improving market conditions to pay off our repo counterparties rather than entering into an onerous comprehensive forbearance agreement.",
         "While we are providing information as of 3/31 on Slides 3 and 4 for informational purposes, that snapshot was taken in the middle of our de-levering and does not reflect the portfolio today. Slide 6 gives a picture of the portfolio as of May 31.",
         "As you can see from the pie chart, our $1.6 billion securities portfolio consists of predominantly non-agency CMBS in residential credit positions. $540 million of that total is unencumbered. The only borrowings we have left are secured federal home loan bank advances of $837 million which are collateralized by high quality triple-A and double-A rated CMBS. As of 5/31, we estimate that our book value is between $2.65 and $3.15 per share, reflecting the continued de-levering that took place post quarter end. Currently, we are holding a credit portfolio with modest leverage that we believe has potential to drive book value upside as credit markets continue to recover.",
         "Going forward, our strategy is to reinvest proceeds from these future credit sales into what will become an increasingly agency-focused portfolio. Currently, the outlook for agency mortgages is quite attractive with strong support from the Fed and an attractive funding environment. This is in contrast to the non-agency credit market where the pandemic has revealed new risks to the strategy and the cost and stability of short-term mark-to-market funding are not attractive. We believe that we will be able to generate attractive ROEs in coming quarters as redeploy into the industry strategy.",
         "I\u2019ll stop here and let Kevin give some details on the credit portfolio."
      ],
      "Kevin Collins": [
         "Thanks John, and thanks to everyone on the line for your interest in Invesco Mortgage Capital. ",
         "As John noted, our portfolio is now largely comprised of mortgage-backed credit investments, so that\u2019s about 92% comprised of commercial mortgage credit and about 7% that\u2019s comprised of residential credit. The COVID-19 pandemic and related decline in economic activity has made it pretty difficult for many borrowers to meet their financial obligations, so not surprisingly lodging and retail property markets have been impacted the most just due to travel restrictions, as well as the slowdown in retail activity. ",
         "So, looking ahead, we do expect many tenants to continue to forego rent payments or seek relief, but despite our expectations for fundamental weakness, we do believe that bonds at the top or near the top of the capital structure offer attractive value, as they\u2019ve been impacted by the lack of liquidity just as much as heightened concerns regarding COVID-19.",
         "We ultimately believe that non mark-to-market term financing via the term asset-backed securities loan facility, which is a New York Fed program known as TALF, should really continue to assist in creating renewed investor interest in these bonds. Roughly 9% of our bonds, our CMBS bonds would be eligible for TALF financing if they were purchased today; however, I do want to note that we expect a much larger portion of our portfolio to benefit indirectly as many of the investments sit just beneath these bonds in the capital structure which makes them, we think, very well positioned to benefit from any future credit curve flattening.",
         "To quantify, I\u2019d ask you take a look at the chart by credit ratings embedded on Slide 7, and as of /5/31 you\u2019ll see that about 85% of our credit investments were rated single-A or higher and about 90% of our commercial mortgage credit was rated single-A or higher. Further, over 75% of our CMBS portfolio was rated double-A or higher.",
         "On Slide 7 in the chart to your right, we\u2019ve also illustrated that significant subordination levels are available to help absorb the expected increase cumulative collateral losses. Nearly 90% of our CMBS benefits from 15 or more points of subordination and positively roughly 93% have subordination levels in excess of those [indiscernible] cumulative collateral losses. We think that\u2019s worth noting because, not surprisingly, loans originated in \u201907 have experienced notable losses just given that they\u2019ve had to endure the global financial crisis and they don\u2019t benefit from recently improved underwriting.",
         "I\u2019ll now turn the presentation over to Brian to discuss our strategic outlook for the portfolio."

            "On the asset sales to wind down the FHLB line, which assets do you think you might sell in order to accomplish that? Would they come from more of the triple-A, double-A category, or something in the positions that are lower rated than that? ",
            "Then on the CMBS portfolio, the stuff that\u2019s remaining, what\u2019s the level of unrealized losses that are sitting in that portfolio, and what\u2019s the unlevered yield in the CMBS portfolio now? "

         "Remarks": [
            "I\u2019ll start with the home loan. The bonds underlying the home loan advances are double-A and triple-A predominantly, so those are the ones that would be sold to pay down that line. Again, as we anticipate the top of the capital structure improving as the TALF starts to get underway, we expect that to be relatively soon. ",

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes Eric, to give you a sense for where we\u2019re seeing things trade today and putting into context to what we currently own in our portfolio, I guess I\u2019d start at the top of the capital structure for us, which is, I believe, about 30% of our portfolio that\u2019s currently in triple-A CMBS. Those are--excuse me, 38% of our CMBS portfolio is triple-A.",
            "Those are largely junior triple-A rated positions, so in terms of where they\u2019re trading, again it\u2019s very dependent on transactions, but I\u2019d call it around 160 basis points, double-A rated paper, anywhere from 250 to as wide as 400 basis points, and single-A paper around 450 basis points on a spreaded level, and triple-B looks more like 800 to anywhere 1,300 over in terms of current yields."

      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Great, that\u2019s helpful color. Maybe I can press you on the unrealized losses that are sitting in the portfolio today. We can see where it was at the end of the quarter, but based on the sales that have taken place since then, just what the market is on the overall portfolio and how much of that is in unrealized loss position.",
            "I\u2019ll just ask my second question today. Just how much leverage do you think you might run in the agency RMBS portfolio as you transition back to that strategy?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Eric Hagen"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, so I don\u2019t have those specific numbers in front of me, Eric, but what I can tell you is, to kind of go back to what I walked you through, if you think through the junior triple-A rated positions, what is largely junior triple-As, as I mentioned, about 9% are [indiscernible], so those would be more senior positions. But at 5/31, those were around 250 basis points on a spread level. That looks more like 160 today. For the double-A positions at 5/31, that was 400 basis points, it looks more like 250. For single-A rated, 650 at 5/31, looks more like 450 today, and 5/31 for triple B, 1,300, looks more like 800, so that should provide some context in terms of what we see in the way of improvement. Just continue to see slowly increasing demand in the CMBS sector since TALF has come online - that\u2019s certainly helped, and -- as the economy begins to slowly restart here, we\u2019ve seen some new entrants into the space or crossover investors, so I think that\u2019s helped as well."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Eric, I\u2019ll take the leverage question. We anticipate--you know, the transition from our current portfolio to a predominantly agency only portfolio will likely take one or two quarters, so it\u2019s going to take us a while to build up to this number, but it\u2019s likely to be in the seven to eight times debt to equity on agency investments."

But yes, we realize that the preferred to common ratio is clearly not where it was, and we would prefer to get it back to more in line with historical averages."
