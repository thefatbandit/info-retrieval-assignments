         "It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations, Ryan Glenn."

      "Ryan Glenn": [
         "Good afternoon, and welcome to Paylocity\u2019s earnings results call for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020, which ended on June 30, 2020. I\u2019m Ryan Glenn, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations. And joining me on the call today is Steve Beauchamp, CEO of Paylocity; and Toby Williams, CFO of Paylocity.",
         "Today, we will be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market closed. A webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 45 days on our website under the Investor Relations tab.",
         "Before beginning, we must caution you that today\u2019s remarks, including statements made during the question-and-answer session, contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to numerous important factors, risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from the results implied by these or other forward-looking statements.",

         "We believe that non-GAAP measures are more representative of how we internally measure the business, and there is a reconciliation schedule detailing these results currently available in our press release, which is located on our website at paylocity.com under the Investor Relations tab and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Please note that we are unable to reconcile any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to their directly comparable GAAP financial measure because the information which is needed to complete a reconciliation is unavailable at this time without unreasonable effort.",

      "Steve Beauchamp": [
         "Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to all of you for joining us on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 earnings call. Before discussing our results, I want to first provide an update on the evolving situation around COVID-19 and its impact to our business. Our number one priority has remained ensuring the safety and health of our employees, while also providing world-class service to our more than 24,000 clients.",
         "All of our business functions have remained fully operational throughout the pandemic with no disruption to clients. I continue to be impressed by the dedication of our more than 3,600 employees as they have transitioned to nearly 100% remote working environment while helping our clients through these challenging times.",
         "In terms of our financial results, given the COVID-related headwinds, we were pleased with our Q4 results, which saw recurring revenue and other revenue of $129.3 million or 12.7% growth with total revenue of $130.6 million at the top end of our guidance for the quarter. For fiscal 2020, recurring and other revenue was $546.2 million or 22% growth with total revenue of $561.3 million or 20% growth.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $30.8 million or 23.6% margin. For fiscal 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $159.8 million or 28.5% margin. Our growth formula continues to be driven by adding new clients to our platform and selling more product to each client. We onboarded a record number of new clients in fiscal 2020, finishing the fiscal year with 24,450 clients, compared to 20,200 at the end of last fiscal year, an increase of 21%.",
         "In terms of where we\u2019re winning, we continue to see strength across our entire target market. Unit strength continues with a record number of new clients, driven by our success with clients under 50 employees. This segment of the market continues to demand more than payroll, taking a broader array of HCM products, such as learning management, onboarding, recruiting and performance management.",
         "The sales performance in the core part of our market, 50 to 1,000 employees was the biggest driver to successful fiscal 2020. New sales were up over 40% for the first nine months of the year. And despite the macro headwinds of COVID-19, we still started more new annual recurring revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 than we did in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.",
         "Overall, we are pleased by the attach rates we are realizing throughout our target market as clients continue to see the value in our comprehensive product suite with modern features that address the ever-changing workplace landscape. Our commitment to product development continues to be recognized in the marketplace, with Paylocity ranking high on multiple G2 Crowd Grid reports during fiscal 2020, including a top 10 ranking in the Best Products for HR, top 50 products for Mid-market, Highest Satisfaction Products and Best Software Product categories.",
         "We increased our investment in research and development in fiscal 2020 by over 24%, when you consider what we expense and capitalize. Continued investment in research and development positions us to extend our industry-leading platform by adding functionality to our existing product suite and introducing new products. We also continue to receive strong feedback on learning management and community with client usage up significantly during Q4. Training classes created, assigned and completed were all up significantly in the quarter, and we also saw a notable increase in mobile usage within our learning management platform.",
         "Last week, we announced the release of Ask an Expert, a new feature within community that provides a forum between employees and subject matter experts. Ask an Expert, users will have direct access to groups where they can get answers on topics such as payroll, benefits and IT troubleshooting, just to name a few. This new feature provides organizations with an avenue to share meaningful, timely and relevant content with employees, which is especially important in this new environment.",
         "In addition to Ask an Expert, in an effort to help prospects and clients rethink how they recruit, rehire and engage their workforce in this new environment, we recently released a number of other new product features and resources. To help clients maintain a safe work environment, we released mobile attestation, which allows employers to configure, punch in props to identify potential COVID symptoms in their employees.",
         "Further, our newly released time and labor scheduling reinforcement allows administrators to manage shift capacity to abide by CDC social distancing guidelines. To support remote engagement for managers, we also launched two new courses within learning management, including keeping virtual employees engaged and collaborating in virtual meetings. In addition, new courses around mindfulness and managing stress are also now available in our product.",
         "To help clients recruit and rehire within our recruiting and onboarding modules, organizations can now launch virtual rehire events by automatically changing the status of the furloughed employees and inviting past employees to submit applications for rehire. Clients can easily invite candidates to apply for specific jobs, aiding in expanding talent pools. To expedite the onboarding process for rehires, Paylocity rolled out geolocation enhancements to immediately validate state and local taxes based on employee\u2019s home and work address.",
         "This year, we also deepened our strength in video communication capabilities via the acquisition of VidGrid in early April, a leading video platform provider that enables peer-to-peer video learning courses. We believe video will play a critical role in transforming workplace communication, and we see an opportunity to leverage VidGrid\u2019s video capabilities more broadly throughout our HCM product suite. We have also continued to invest in our sales force by adding new sales reps, while at the same time, investing in training initiatives and marketing and channel programs to drive productivity. We have expanded the sales force by 14% this fiscal year from 382 sales reps in fiscal 2020 to 437 sales reps in fiscal 2021. In addition, in fiscal 2019, we started building a sales team focused on emerging clients, who are at the lower end of our target market.",
         "Smaller clients are increasingly demanding modern HCM components as part of their solution, and we believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver a single SaaS-based product across the entire SMB market. While these efforts continue to ramp up and remain a small portion of our overall sales team, we are entering fiscal 2021 with approximately 60 reps focused on inside and outside emerging market sales, and again, this group of reps has grown to 60 over the past two fiscal years. The 60 reps for fiscal 2021 is an increase of approximately 15% from the prior year, in line with our overall sales head count growth. This gives us a total of 497 reps coming into fiscal 2021.",
         "In addition to investing in the growth of our sales force, we also continue to invest in our channel initiatives and we remain pleased with the consistency in our referral channel, which continued to deliver more than 25% of our new business in fiscal 2020. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank our more than 3,600 highly dedicated employees across the country for all the efforts this past fiscal year. These past few months have been an exceptionally challenging time, and I want to recognize all of our employees for their hard work and dedication in helping our clients through this crisis. I would now like to pass the call to Toby to review the quarter\u2019s results in detail and provide financial guidance."

      "Toby Williams": [
         "Thanks, Steve. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $130.6 million, an increase of 8.5% and with recurring and other revenues up 12.7% from the same period last year. As Steve noted, our sales team had a solid quarter in the face of a challenging environment, and we were pleased to come in $4.6 million above the midpoint of our revenue guidance despite the anticipated COVID-19-related and interest rate-related headwinds. For the year, recurring and other revenues were up 22%, and total revenue was up 20%.",
         "For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit was 70.1% and for the year, it was 72.1%. We continue to make significant investments in research and development. And to understand our overall investment in R&D, it is important to combine both what we expense and what we capitalize. On a combined non-GAAP basis, total R&D investments were 16.3% of revenue in the fourth quarter compared to 14.6% in the year ago quarter. Full year total research and development investments were 14.3% of revenue compared to 13.8% in fiscal 2019. On a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 24.4% in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019. We continue to believe our investment in R&D provide us with valuable product differentiation and the ability to drive future growth. On a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 22.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter and 23.3% for fiscal 2020.",
         "On a non-GAAP basis, G&A costs were 15.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter versus 15.3% in the same period last year. Full year G&A costs were 13.8% of revenue as compared to 14.8% in fiscal 2019, and we are pleased to have remained in our long-term range of 10% to 15%. We remain focused on consistently leveraging our G&A expenses on an annual basis.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $30.8 million or 23.6% margin and $12.8 million ahead of guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA for the year was $159.8 million or 28.5% of total revenue. We remain committed to progressing towards our adjusted EBITDA target of 30% to 35% of revenue once we return to a normalized macroeconomic environment.",
         "Briefly covering our GAAP results. For the quarter, gross profit was $84.7 million, operating income was $6.3 million and net income was $5 million. For the full year, gross profit was $379.3 million, operating income was $66.2 million and net income was $64.5 million. In regard to the balance sheet, we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and invested corporate cash of $288 million as compared to $162.5 million as of the end of last year, an increase of $125.5 million or 77.2%. As a reminder, we also drew down $100 million from our revolving credit facility in early April, purely out of an abundance of caution, given the uncertainty we\u2019ve all experienced.",
         "Free cash flow, which we define as cash from operating activities, less capitalized internal use software costs, purchase of property and equipment and lease allowances for tenant improvements, was $70.4 million or 12.5% of revenue in fiscal 2020 versus $76.1 million or 16.3% of revenue in fiscal 2019.",
         "Before reviewing guidance, I would like to provide some additional color on the current operating environment. While we cannot predict the depth and duration of the COVID-19 related economic environment, we did see headwinds in Q4 from COVID-19 that we believe will impact our business for a period of time. In April, we began to see a reduction in employees on our platform, which has marginally improved as the quarter progressed. Also, while we believe there continues to be a heightened risk for clients going out of business, we are pleased to report that our revenue retention remained above 92% throughout fiscal 2020.",
         "On sales, our team experienced great momentum in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, and their activity remains strong as they continue to engage with prospects via video and phone in a virtual selling environment. As Steve noted, we started more new annual recurring revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 than we did in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.",
         "In regard to client held funds and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was $1.2 billion in Q4 and $1.4 billion for fiscal 2020. We are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $1.2 billion in Q1, and we assume an average yield of approximately 10 basis points in the first quarter. Finally, I\u2019d like to provide our guidance for Q1 of fiscal 2021, which incorporates known and some estimated impacts related to COVID-19. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $131.5 million to $135.5 million or 5.4% growth at the midpoint over first quarter of fiscal 2020 total revenue. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $18.5 million to $21.5 million.",

         "Remarks": [
            "Congrats on the good quarter. I guess a couple for me. Steve, let\u2019s start with sales in the quarter, I guess, kind of versus our expectations. Curious to know how they trended relative to maybe the same conversation 90 days ago in what your thoughts going into the quarter were.",
            "And then secondly, the comments on -- you started more ARR in the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Is that a function of sales actually occurring -- that occurred in the quarter or sales that may be partially a function of that started in the third quarter?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Scott Berg"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, Scott. So I think as we entered the pandemic, we had significant momentum in sales. I think as mentioned in the prepared script, we\u2019re up 40% year-over-year going into the pandemic and so we were pretty happy to be able to kind of start more than we had last year. There\u2019s two facets to that: one is, how much you sell in the quarter and then, obviously, what you might already have submitted on the docket. But remember, we did have a bunch of delays in submits, and we called that out last quarter. And so when you combine the fact that there were some delays, but the sales force was still submitting new business. The fact that we were able to actually start more business than last year was really kind of a combination of both.",
            "And then I think the other thing I would tell you is momentum kind of built throughout the quarter. And so as we look at July, we had a great selling month in July. And so we are very much approaching those pre-COVID sales levels as we move past the fiscal year and into July."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Steve Beauchamp"
      },
      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Excellent. And then from a follow-up question. I think my Minnesota math tells me your -- the revenue level of the company is about 6x the size as what it was in 2014 when you went public. Yet partners still generate about 25% of your net new business, which I think is super impressive 6 years later. But how long do you think that\u2019s sustainable kind of in those levels? I know you\u2019ve been talking about the last couple of years even after the ACA bump that 25% is kind of the right level to think about. But as we go forward the next two or three years, can we still be in that 25%, maybe 20% range?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Scott Berg"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So I\u2019m really pleased to be able to have more than 25% of our new business revenue come from partners. There are thousands and thousands of potential partners. When you really think the relationships we have are between our individual sales reps and those individual brokers. So it\u2019s not just the firms, but it\u2019s the individual brokers that provide those leads to our sales reps.",
            "And so we see an opportunity to be able to get deeper relationships with our existing partners as well as the opportunity to be able to add new partners. And we\u2019ve made investment over the last couple of years, both in product as well as some channel marketing opportunities that we think it remains really a -- really core part of our go-to-market on a go-forward basis. And so I\u2019m not sure if you fast forward another six years, whether it can still be 25% or more of our business, but we feel pretty confident in the near future that it will be as important as it has been in the past."

         "Remarks": [

      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, we definitely try to drive our business based off starts. This is very much how we\u2019ve kind of run the equation. And so when you think about starts, you\u2019ve got bookings that happened a little bit at the end of last quarter, but the reality is a lot of our sales happen in that same quarter. And so we weren\u2019t on the same toward pace we were on that 40% prior to the pandemic. But we saw a little bit of a lull as we entered April, and then we saw things build back up from a sales perspective throughout the end of the quarter.",
            "To the point where we look at July, and that\u2019s one of the best months we\u2019ve ever had. And so I think that\u2019s the way to kind of think about it is certainly a little bit of headwind early in the quarter, building throughout the rest of the quarter to a point where we feel really good about where we sit today after looking at July."

         "Remarks": [
            "Great. And then can you talk a little bit about the impact on revenue in terms of the reduction in terms of the employees per client? How much of a reduction did you see in terms of the number of employees per client? And is there any way to quantify what the revenue headwind was during the quarter because of that relative to the prior quarter?"

      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So if you look at pre-pandemic, recurring revenue and other was near 25% growth over the last several quarters before we entered the pandemic. And so if you were to take into account the workforce reduction that we saw in the platform, if we didn\u2019t have that reduction in the workforce, we would have been at a very similar rate. So I think that gives you the opportunity to kind of fill in the math in terms of what the impact of the pandemic was in the quarter."

      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Great. And then can you talk a little bit about bridging -- what goes into the assumption with regards to revenue and EBITDA here for the upcoming first quarter? What areas are you going to spend more? Or are there going to gross margin contractions? Or how should we think about that?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Mark Marcon"
      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So first on revenue, I think the way to think about it is we saw, as Toby mentioned, employees declined rather quickly in April, and then it started to build back up, but very, very slowly. And so right now, what we\u2019re seeing in July is fairly flat employment levels and that\u2019s kind of the assumption that we put into our revenue model. We assume that we would continue to gain momentum in sales, as I had mentioned, with July being very strong. So that\u2019s another key part of the assumption in the model.",
            "And then from an expense perspective, as we entered the pandemic, out of an abundance of caution, we did halt a bunch of our hiring and some of our programs and we did get a fair amount of kind of onetime benefit associated with that. But as we saw our momentum building throughout the quarter, we started getting back into investment mode and hiring mode. And so that is certainly thought through in terms of our EBITDA number for the first quarter. Our view is, we need to continue to invest for the long term. We\u2019ve got a huge opportunity in front of us. And this pandemic is going to last a while, but it isn\u2019t going to last forever, and we want to come out of the other side of it with momentum."

            "If I could squeeze one more in. 30% to 35% adjusted EBITDA margins when we get back to normal. Does that include interest rates being back to normal? And what would that -- what in your mind is that?"

      },
      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So I mean, obviously, this was a tough kind of interest rate environment. We had absorbed several interest rate declines. And if you go through the first three quarters of the year, we were well on pace to meet or exceed our 28% adjusted EBITDA from the year prior. And so I don\u2019t think we need a big tailwind in interest rates to hit the bottom end of that 30% to 35% range. We could still hit that in a low interest rate environment. It might take us a little bit longer than it would have had prior, but we definitely think that\u2019s achievable."

I guess, broadly speaking, guys like over the last five months, what\u2019s been the biggest differentiator for you when it comes to winning replacement deals? And based on your observations, which product areas in your suite are most critical to both perspective and existing customers right now?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. So I think if you take a step back and you think about our product strategy, it really revolves around being the most modern platform available to our customers. And a lot of the features that we have designed and we\u2019ve added to the platform, really appeal to a modern worker. And as everyone has had to transition to work from home or flexible work arrangements or really changing the way they\u2019re running their business, it becomes a very opportune time to be able to look at, how are you training employees, how are you onboarding employees, how are you doing your performance management process.",
            "And so I think that has really resonated and allowed us to continue with the sales momentum that we had pre-COVID. We\u2019ve also added, and as I said in the prepared remarks, a lot to our product in terms of features specific to COVID, but also features that we think are going to be really important on a go-forward basis. So the idea of communicating via video has become very commonplace within our customer set and so we\u2019re excited about that acquisition and the ability to be able to integrate that into our portfolio. So we saw huge increases in LMS.",
            "We saw increases in surveys, we saw increases in community products as all ways for employers to connect with employees as they are working in virtual environments or in different ways than they ever have before, and we think those will be helpful on a go-forward basis."

            "Yes. I think a lot of our expenses fall into people-oriented expenses, right, whether it\u2019s them building products, selling customers or servicing our customers. And so we\u2019ve always had an approach towards investing in R&D for the long term and investing in sales and marketing for the long term. And where we\u2019ve historically gotten more leverage is out of gross margin. A lot of our HCM products naturally carry a higher margin and then over G&A.",
            "And so I think as we enter this kind of next phase of the pandemic, we want to go back to our roots of investing in sales and marketing for growth. And investing in R&D, while at the same time, finding ways to be able to create leverage in G&A and gross margin. Now some of that leverage might take a little while to come back because it requires people to come back to work and get those workforce reduction numbers to positive territory, but that\u2019s really the approach we\u2019re going to take on a go-forward basis."

It sounds like July was pretty strong. I\u2019m just curious, is there any commonality in terms of the new business you\u2019re adding in terms of size or, hey, attach rates to certain products, what you\u2019re ripping out? I\u2019m just curious because, obviously, things have changed, obviously, in the macro.

We definitely saw a little bit of delays in decisions. And at times, people would delay their implementation for obvious reasons as their business is being disrupted. But we didn\u2019t really lose a lot of opportunities. Sometimes, it just took us a little bit longer to get them across the finish line. So we still saw unit strength throughout the quarter. So small business is still moving on board with us.",
            "And then larger organizations, we saw also moving. So I wouldn\u2019t characterize any difference in terms of industry or market segment. Obviously, you would expect a little less activity in places like hospitality, but the thing that you got to remember is we\u2019ve only got nearly 25,000 clients, a little over 24,000 in a market with over 600,000 businesses that we can go after. So I think the sales force was pretty acute at focusing on customers that probably are less disrupted and then really continue to build that activity on momentum that we saw increase throughout the quarter and then really start to get back very, very close to those pre-COVID levels in July."

And so what we found is many of these features, whether it is a more modern way to do performance management, onboarding your employees seamlessly, interacting with them with our community product or learning management, it started to really increase in what we saw demand really pre-pandemic.

Or -- and maybe also just comment, obviously, you didn\u2019t give a full year guide, your peers didn\u2019t either. But how are you thinking about that?

So first of all, the first three quarters, we were up 40% year-over-year, and a lot of that was driven by head count, but a significant portion was driven by productivity. So we had some really good productivity trends. As we went into our planning process for the next fiscal year, much of which happened even pre-pandemic, we felt like we could continue that trend with increased productivity, which at the end of the day, we think is obviously more efficient and a great way to be able to grow the business.",

And we still see an opportunity from a productivity perspective as the economy starts to recover to kind of get back to that same run rate we were on pre-pandemic.

I guess I\u2019m just -- we\u2019re just trying to better understand how we can use maybe publicly available data to track that trend or what\u2019s the difference between the Paylocity customer base versus kind of the broader employment end market?"

So from a forecasting perspective, we have the advantage of looking at things in very real time.",
            "But if you think of the increase of the unemployment rate and the number of people applying for unemployment and you start to think about where it was before and assume that we get that impact in a more real-time fashion in our platform, it does actually correlate kind of fairly well. And if you think of what we\u2019re saying right now is we think that there was a little bit of a recovery fairly minor, that kind of tie to what you\u2019re seeing nationally in terms of the reports, but things have kind of flattened, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve assumed in our guidance.

And so we\u2019ve seen more customers add on-demand pay as an option for their employees. It is still, what I would say, relatively small in terms of percentage of our total customers and growing.

So it\u2019s a relatively quick time frame. Most of our bookings happen certainly within that 6-week time frame. Once in a while, you get a little bit of a larger client that takes longer. And candidly, on the small end of the market, we can get customers up and running in a couple of weeks. So it\u2019s a pretty quick cycle.",

So you had things like significant pause in T&E, which lasted the quarter. But as Steve said, you had a pause on hiring as well.",

And so we pushed pause on a lot of hiring across the business that would have typically been taking place. And then as you get to the -- into the May and then in June time frame, as we got towards the end of the quarter, we started to refocus on the normal cadence of investments. And I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re sort of all the way back on that point.",

Our goal is to come out of this, managing prudently all the way through it from a spend perspective. But when we come out of this, we want to be regaining the same momentum that we came in with. So I think you saw -- you did see a shift in terms of spend in Q4, where it would have been paused in sort of the earlier part and started to gradually come back. And then as we\u2019re coming into Q1, you have those levels and that cadence continuing."

You guys tracked about like those who applied PPP loans, did you see something that clients told you maybe let people go, furloughed in the beginning, but they hired back after they got the PPP loan. Any kind of trends, can you talk about that?"

         "Remarks": [
            "So I think at the most macro level, the trend was people were absolutely furloughing employees, letting people go, reducing their workforce in early April. And then towards the end of April, we started to see off of the bottom, people started to hire some of those people back. And some of that was, I\u2019m sure, due to PPP loans and others might have just been due to as businesses started to reopen or figured out a different business model in some cases.",
            "And we saw that increase throughout the rest of the quarter were at a fairly slow rate to the point where, as we entered July and you saw this spike in a lot of different parts of the country, we\u2019ve now seen that flat line again. So we\u2019re nowhere near the pre-COVID levels of employment, but it did hit the bottom in April. It moved up a little bit and now has kind of flat lined.",
            "And I think PPP loans plays part in that equation. But the PPP loan doesn\u2019t have a sudden cliff where all of a sudden, you see it because it depends how long you\u2019re going to be able to work through that. It depends if you\u2019re going to be able to get forgiveness for the loan. And remember, legislation came out later that extended that, so you could use up to 24 weeks for that.",
            "So I think we\u2019ve probably seen some of the impact of the PPP loan, and we may have others that have gotten the loan later in the cycle and still may have access to some of those dollars to be able to maintain higher levels of employment. But I think if you net all of that out, that\u2019s the impact that we saw."

And so I think because of that, we see less conversations around pricing.

Are some of the clients basically kind of essentially who are with some of the legacy HCM players frustrated with essentially those legacy players?

So the traditional payroll providers, the in-house methods, the small regional players, we\u2019ve been able to compete with all of those. And our message hasn\u2019t changed a lot. I think what\u2019s become a little bit more important is the fact that customers are looking for different ways to connect with employees because employees are spending more time working from home. There is much more transparency required in terms of what shifts you\u2019re scheduled for and how you might be able to exchange that and manage that.",

They\u2019re really trying to find ways to save themselves time and connect with employees and so we feel pretty good about the value proposition that we offered pre-COVID.
