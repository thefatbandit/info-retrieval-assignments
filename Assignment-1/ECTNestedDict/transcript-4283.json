         "Good morning, everyone. This is Asiya Merchant from Citi Research. With me today we have Corning, Tony Tripeny, CFO; and Jeff Evenson, who is the Chief Strategy Officer. Welcome, gentlemen.",
         "Before we begin, I just have a few housekeeping items from Citi Research. There are disclosures associated with this for your review. All clients are subject to MiFID II and they\u2019re reminded to have research agreements in place with Citi.",
         "We have a few questions and Tony has a few opening comments. After which we have a few questions that we\u2019ve prepared for the event. However, if investors have any questions during this live stream, please feel free to email me at asiya.merchant@citi.com.",
         "So with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Tony and Jeff for some opening comments from Corning."
      ],
      "Tony Tripeny": [
         "All right, Asiya. Thank you very much. It\u2019s great to be here. Just a reminder, the statements made in the course of my presentation today may contain forward-looking information and actual results may differ material -- materially from what we are presenting today.",
         "And of course, we were all confronting profound challenges as a result of COVID-19 and our thoughts are those who are directly affected by the pandemic and the many people fighting it on the front lines.",
         "If you go back and recall during our July earnings call, we noted our expectations for sequential growth based on improved demand and visibility during both June and July. Our industries were flashing green, as Wendell said, but we didn\u2019t provide specific guidance because we were concerned about potential impacts arising from the pandemic, global recession, civil unrest and geopolitical tensions. But what we did say is that we would update you as we went through the quarter and that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to do today.",
         "Q3 consensus has sales up high-single digits and EPS up 30% versus the second quarter. And today I\u2019m pleased to say that we expect total company sales to grow low team sequentially, with the biggest contributors being Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies. And we also expect EPS will also be above consensus.",
         "Now that we expect this improved profitability giving the operating leverage that we have as a company, plus we have capacity in place to meet expected demand with minimal investment. So we expect capital efficiency gains, including improvement in ROIC and we remain on track to generate positive free cash flow for the year.",
         "Our decisive actions and strong execution are driving these results. We are the delivering for our customers, outperforming our markets and preserving our financial strength. And as we look ahead, our underlying growth drivers remain intact, we\u2019re confident Corning is positioned to come back stronger than ever.",
         "So with that, Asiya, Jeff and I\u2019d be happy to answer any questions you have."

         "Remarks": [
            "Great. So with the positive three, you kind of talked about Specialty and Environmental, if we can kind of dig into each one of those first, maybe starting with Specialty Materials, which is obviously your Gorilla Glass. You have the Gorilla Glass Victus. So maybe you could talk about the confidence or the trends that you saw as calendar third quarter evolved and the -- what drove the positive three today?"

      },
      "2": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. So from a Specialty Materials standpoint, as you said, a lot of that is driven by what\u2019s happening in Gorilla Glass. And what we saw in the second quarter was actually year-over-year growth in Specialty Materials, in spite of the fact that this underlying smartphone market was down about 14%, I think, in the second quarter.",
            "And what really drove that was the technology and the innovations that we\u2019re bringing to that market, and in particular, as our customers are building in advance of their new product launches that occur primarily in the third quarter.",
            "And of course, we also introduced a new set of products, including Gorilla Glass Victus, that we introduced, I think, at the beginning of this quarter and the expectations of the success around that. So we feel good that the trends that we were on in the second quarter continue into the third quarter and that we see some nice growth in the third quarter sequentially and actually some growth on a year-over-year basis based on the new product introductions and the success of our innovations."

         "Speaker": "Tony Tripeny"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And I think one thing that I would add on that is, we have broke from our trend of using numbers for Gorilla Glass versions. And we did that because Victus is distinctive from earlier innovations in giving benefit both on drop performance and scratch performance and we wanted to recognize that distinctive contribution with a new approach to the naming. And I think the financial success in that business that we\u2019re seeing in the third quarter is really confirmation of the benefits that our customers are seeing in the simultaneous innovation on both fronts."

         "Remarks": [
            "Fair enough. And then, obviously, the question that investors always have is, you\u2019ve seen growth in this segment on a year-on-year basis year-to-date along with the positive trends you\u2019re seeing in calendar third quarters, smartphone units are down year-on-year. Is there any inventory build that\u2019s happening, perhaps at your end customers with respect to your Specialty Materials?"

         "Speaker": "Asiya Merchant"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, certainly, I think, there\u2019s a buildup in anticipation of the new product introductions and so that is absolutely happening. And if you go back over time, that inventory then gets sold once they\u2019ve introduced the new products. And so a lot of what the impact is going to be from a longer term standpoint it depends a lot on the success of the new product introductions that they have and assuming that they are consistent with what they\u2019re expecting then this buildup happens and it does tend to plateau out in the normal cycle that we see in this business. But there\u2019s no reason to think that it\u2019s something different than that."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And also remember that it\u2019s only fair that is we make big innovations on behalf of customers that we share in the benefits of that through higher pricing. So in terms of the magnitude that you see, we think is very appropriate for product launches of this nature from a unit perspective."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Are there any particular features or functionality in the new phones that makes them more interesting from a Specialty Gorilla Glass consumption basis, whether it\u2019s 5G, whether it\u2019s glass on both ends? There\u2019s some things that you could point out to why there\u2019s a higher adoption of Specialty Glass for this latest and greatest smartphones looking ahead?"

      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, I think, 5G we\u2019ve been talking about the benefits of that in terms of opening up the -- that the glass opens up designed degrees of freedom for the antennas. We\u2019ve been talking about that for a while. I think the benefits here are just really in the dollar content is higher because the benefits we\u2019re delivering in terms of protection both from drops and scratches is higher."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Fair enough. If we can switch a little bit as well now to your Environmental Technologies that you\u2019re seeing is also driving some of the upside here. If you can talk a little bit about the gas particulate filters and what you\u2019re seeing in there that would be great. I mean, clearly automotive demand, people are still a bit mixed on that it will bottom. Are you kind of experiencing that and what\u2019s the drivers behind your upside for the Environmental business?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Asiya Merchant"
      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, clearly, what we saw in the Environmental business was a big impact in the second quarter is our customers shutdown their assembly plants. You know that first happened in China and that actually started to impact us in the first quarter. China came back online in the second quarter. The North America market and Europe -- the European market came offline in the second quarter and began to come back in the third quarter. And so, partly what we\u2019re seeing is just that the some of our customers coming online faster and that\u2019s having a positive impact from a business standpoint.",
            "But, so then what you have to really look at, which is, as you said is, what\u2019s happening with the underlying demand. And in China, the underlying demand is continued to be pretty good. On a year-over-year basis, China auto sales have been up for several months and first couple months, you wondered, well, is that just the pent-up demand from earlier in the year, but as each month goes by and that continues to be the case, that does seem to be an indication that that is definitely a positive from an in market demand standpoint.",
            "And of course, that\u2019s where we really see the impact of gasoline particulate filters, because that\u2019s the market where they\u2019re really being adopted now. And so that\u2019s allowed us to grow, I mean, even last quarter, we shrank, but we shrank less than the overall market, because of the impact of GPS and we continue to see that and there\u2019s nothing on the -- in the market environment that doesn\u2019t say that as China grows that we will get the content boosts that comes from GPS.",
            "And then so the rest of what we\u2019re watching most like -- most companies is what\u2019s happening in the North America auto market, we\u2019re all signs seem to be pretty positive and also what\u2019s happening in the European auto market. But when you add all that up together, that\u2019s stronger growth sequentially after a quarter, of course, wasn\u2019t so great in the second quarter."

      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Great. And then how does that affect your outlook for auto sales? I know you had some pretty aggressive growth drivers there that you laid out at your Analyst Day last year for auto sales. So in general, with GPF rebounding, plus you have auto interiors and ex -- the auto exterior business as well. How should we think about that as a revenue contributors say in the next six months to 12 months and then with respect to your long-term outlook for all auto sales contribution?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Asiya Merchant"
      },
      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So, I think, that the timetable that it takes for auto production at our end customer level and auto sales by the end consumers to get back to the levels that they were before given the pandemic is, probably, longer than any of the rest of our businesses. I think that\u2019s the business that was most dramatically impacted by the pandemic from a Corning standpoint in Q1 and Q2, and is probably the one that takes the longest to recover now, when I say that, I don\u2019t mean, years and years to recover, but I think in comparison to some of the other businesses, I think, it takes longer to recover.",
            "That being said, the content part of it really hasn\u2019t changed and isn\u2019t it maybe off track our original expectations of a year ago, a little bit caused by the pandemic, but the underlying trends that are driving that really haven\u2019t changed. I mean, the need for clean air, which is really what\u2019s driving the GPF business is probably even greater than it was before, because I think there\u2019s a pretty clear relationship between air quality and the impact that COVID is having. So I think that people are going to double down around on some of those efforts.",
            "And then in terms of the interior cars and the connectivity, and the experience that you have, and the displays and the like, I mean, those -- that -- those trends are continuing just like they were before. Our backlog continues to build in that business. We continue to see success in that business. So, I think, the vehicle -- the content per vehicle, which is the way we described it back last June, we still see those trends continuing and then it\u2019s just a question of how many vehicles are being built and that, clearly, has been disrupted by the pandemic."

      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "With the pandemic and the need for cleaner air, do you see any acceleration perhaps in adoption of GPF in markets that don\u2019t currently have these regulations? Like I think China is one of them that\u2019s already implementing these, but then Europe and North America are still further behind on adopting the clean air initiatives that China has?"

      },
      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. Actually, Europe was first with those and those were adopted and that was the first wave of growth that we saw in that business in the \u201818, \u201819 timeframe and now the wave that we\u2019re seeing right now is in China and we would expect that to continue.",
            "And I think what happens in the North America market is really driven by other regulatory environments than it is COVID per se. We\u2019ve never put those in our longer term projections. Our ability to double sales in the automotive business was not driven by the data of the increased regulations in North America. But I think we\u2019ve always thought that that is something that might happen in the back half of the 2020s and I think that\u2019s still true."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Fair enough. If we can switch a little bit to maybe one of your other segments, if you may, let\u2019s talk about consumer demand for televisions, especially the large size televisions, I think, the demand has been pretty good, given most people were staying at home and had not much other entertainment avenues. I think we\u2019ve heard from notebook OEMs at the conference that the panels are still in tight demand for that. If you could kind of talk to us about demand, how that\u2019s shaping up across different geos? And as you kind of look into the holiday season, what should we be thinking about in terms of television unit growth, size growth, any change in seasonality versus last year, that would be great?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Asiya Merchant"
      },
      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. I think, generally speaking, you\u2019re right, TV demand has been strong and other device demand which, like, notebooks and actually tablets have been relatively strong too. Now when you think about our display business, it\u2019s of course, it\u2019s a lot about big TVs, as you noted. So sometimes those other things don\u2019t necessarily stand out in our commentary, but they\u2019ve definitely had a positive impact on our business. They\u2019ve had a positive impact on Q3 and we\u2019d expect that to continue into Q4.",
            "From a retail standpoint, in China, we saw -- in Q1 we saw a drop off in TV demand. In Q2, it did start to return. Again, we wondered how much of that was catching up versus how much is ongoing demand. But demand in the third quarter is -- has stayed pretty solid and so we\u2019ve been -- that\u2019s been a good trend.",
            "And then in North America and Western Europe, I mean, the trends have been very strong from a TV demand standpoint and for all the reasons that you mentioned. I mean, the one region that hasn\u2019t been as strong has been in the emerging markets and that\u2019s clearly the one geography that we have definitely noticed the difference.",
            "As we look out, there\u2019s a lot of discussion. We got two big holiday seasons coming up the -- kind of the Christmas holiday season starting with Black Friday in the Western world, and of course, Chinese New Year\u2019s coming up after that. We would expect, I think, the question is, does this strength continue into those seasons and it\u2019s not totally certain, but all indications are.",
            "I mean, Black Friday, there\u2019s a lot of dialogue, I think, within a lot of retailers that maybe they spread the Black Friday season out a little bit longer. From a retail standpoint, not as interested in getting lots of people into their stores on the Friday after Thanksgiving as much as they may be interested in getting those sales over a longer period of time.",
            "And then the most important thing from our standpoint is that we do remain very confident in the screen size growth that we thought we\u2019d be about a bit inch and a half or so and TVs 65 inches or larger have grown almost 40% on a year-over-year basis. So, not only are people buying TVs but they\u2019re buying bigger TVs and that\u2019s good for us and especially good for Gen 10.5 investments."

      "18": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Great. And then how does it, talking about the supply side as well, so the demand holding up pretty well. On the supply side seems like glass pricing has remained fairly modest, down or slightly down relative to what previously people had expected. Can you kind of update us on where you think -- how you think about glass pricing here? And as we think about TV demand, could -- is there any opportunity for upside on those glass pricing discussions?"

      "19": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I think from a glass pricing standpoint, we\u2019ve had a favorable environment now for a number of years and we\u2019d expect that to continue. And we expect our pricing decline this year to be in the mid-single digits. It\u2019s really driven by three factors, one is supply and demand being in balance, and it is in balance today and some of these factors that we talked about with increased demand, of course, continues to keep supply and demand in balance and if for some reason that were to change, of course, we have the ability to adjust our capacity based on the modular nature of our capacity.",
            "The second area is that our competitors are not very profitable. And so for their ability to remain profitable, you need to continue to see moderation in pricing.",
            "And then, thirdly, we all have to make investments in this business on an ongoing basis and to get the returns the current level of declines of pricing cannot continue. So we feel good about it from a pricing standpoint and expected the moderate price declines that we expected at the beginning of the year to play out this year."

I mean, I think, being able to build capacity in regions like the -- we were -- we\u2019ve been involved in a pandemic from day one, because we were building one of those factories in Wuhan. So, clearly those things had an impact on the ability to get engineers and employees into the factories and a like. We\u2019re working through all of that. But there\u2019s been a lot of people working on that. I mean, it\u2019s certainly had an impact -- as the pandemic had an impact on most of our operations around the world."

            "Okay. Fair enough. Shifting to optical a little bit, I think, people are very interested in to see -- to understand the optical market that is set to decline, I think, based on your discussions earlier in the year, there -- that\u2019s expected to decline in 2020. So, now that we\u2019re halfway through the year, kind of if you can update investors on fiber demand to the back half of this year, and if you think about pent-up demand as we look into 2021?"

      "27": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. It -- I mean, I think, you\u2019re -- you recalling it correctly. I mean we had expected this year the passive optical market to be down and we had expected to be down for Corning, in particular in the first half of the year and then for things to pick up in the second half of 2020 and the pandemic, clearly, through a lot of that, made a lot of changes relative to that.",
            "I think from a carrier standpoint, the carrier networks have actually seen a lot of increased demand on them, the amount of WiFi calls, I think, it was AT&T is up 100% and the VPN Connections and Verizon up something like 80%, and of course, Zoom went from 10 million users in December to over 300 million users. And so there -- there\u2019s been a dramatically increase in the demand on the networks and the networks are built out in advance in anticipation of that demand.",
            "So all of this we view as a very positive thing for the longer term demand from -- for our products. But in the near-term, as we talked about in the past, we saw some impact especially in the carriers is them getting technicians out into the field for installations and then some of the permitting issues that they you need to get done slowing down.",
            "But in the second quarter that was a place where we did see growth, and in fact, that growth was, I think, about 19% quarter-over-quarter versus what we saw in the first quarter. So, I think, from a carrier standpoint, especially in North America, we\u2019ve seen some positives there and those positives continued in the second quarter in or in the third quarter.",
            "From a hyperscale data centers standpoint, and the same thing, the demand -- underlying demand has definitely been there from a product -- from their product standpoint, but in the end, they haven\u2019t changed any of their deployment plans in terms of where they want to go. But their ability to actually deploy that varies kind of customer by customer and so in our enterprise network that hasn\u2019t been quite as strong, that part of it as it has been in carriers and then in the rest of enterprises definitely been impacted by small and medium business enterprises.",
            "And then also a lot of the corporate IT spending has been constrained to. So we\u2019ve seen a little bit of everything in this segment. And as we go into Q3, we\u2019d expect Q3 to be pretty similar to Q2 in terms of sales, maybe a little bit higher, but pretty similar to Q2 in terms of sales."

So I think that you will see a distribution and how various suppliers are doing in this environment and who\u2019s growing? I think it\u2019s hard to call the near-term. I think medium and longer term positive for lots of leading suppliers, including us. But it\u2019s not surprising to us that some suppliers were maybe more focused on enterprise when and things like that are seeing a little bit weaker results."

It\u2019s been muted from a sales standpoint in part because a lot of what we sell through is academic labs and those academic labs have been shut down. And even as those academic labs start to open up, they open up with certain spacing requirements and certain capacity levels and a like, which doesn\u2019t get you back to the same level of sales as what you were before. So, we would expect to see some growth in that business in the third quarter. But it\u2019s really a tale of two sides of that.",

Both in terms of bringing capacity on Board, with the operation warp speed, money that we were awarded to bring capacity online, in our in our factories in North Carolina. So there\u2019s a lot that we\u2019re doing from an operational standpoint.",

How are you guys -- and you talked about the underlying drivers still being very strong for Corning? If you can talk a little bit about those and how perhaps the pandemic impacted or didn\u2019t impact those kind of drivers across some of your end markets, that would be great?"

That\u2019s been true for all companies. I think as we step back and we\u2019ve talked about this, I think, in a number of areas, we actually feel good about showing more and more that the relevance of our technology and the relevance of what we are trying to accomplish is going to play well as we move into the post-pandemic world, whether it be on in Environmental Technologies, whether it be capturing more data demand and data traffic and broadband demand communications. Just being in a whole virtual world, where going to the office is more about going to your mobile consumer electronic device than it is actually going to a physical plant.",
            "So we feel good about where the underlying demand is going. What we need to do as a leadership team, well, I think, we\u2019re doing reasonably good job at is to just deal with the uncertainty that is happening today, adjust our operations to that uncertainty, while continuing to invest in the trends that are going to cause us to grow over time.",
            "And that\u2019s where our focus has been. We made a lot of operational changes in the second quarter, which are paying off today. But we continue to invest in the future items, and I think, we feel very confident that we\u2019re going to exit this stronger and more competitive than before and that those opportunities will still be out there and our opportunities for long-term growth are still there."

            "Sure. I think there are two sets of changes, there are changes in how we operate the overall company and the mindset that we drive. And then there\u2019s a very specific set of changes on the financial front of how we operate. So maybe I\u2019ll start with the higher level ones and then switch over to Tony on the financial ones.",
            "I think from an overall operations perspective, in a situation like this, taking our emphasis on protecting our employee\u2019s health and supporting them through a difficult time really goes to the top of the agenda and we had a number of mechanisms to do that.",
            "Beyond that, as we felt like, and as Tony mentioned, we\u2019ve been dealing with this since the earliest stages and move on, as we were able to rollout those best practices and feel good about the procedures that we had in place then more emphasis on how we operate over an extended period of time.",
            "And I think that there are two things that I\u2019ll note that I think are important. One is that over the last 18 months, we have been looking at how we evolve or starting 18 months ago looking at how we evolve our organization and leadership for the new phase of strategy that we\u2019re moving into.",
            "We announced those changes externally around the end of the first quarter of this year. We appointed a Chief Operating Officer. We\u2019re now organized around the market access platforms. The -- we started thinking about the reasons for those changes a long time ago way before anybody knew about the pandemic. But the objective was a little bit about how do we build an organization that has the integration points at the right level to make decisions to in a timely fashion to pivot appropriately as we need to and I think that organization structure really helps us be more nimble in this environment.",
            "The second thing that we did is around building a mindset among our leadership team. That is, I think, Corning people are very good at taking a long-term goal and running it. It is no surprise that that to me that this area produces like distinctive long distance athletes, people who are in the Olympics and top NCAA competitors, it\u2019s part of what we do.",
            "But when you have that challenge, you need to remind people, yes, there is a long-term goal, but the reality changes frequently. And how do you build that awareness, build that acceptance and build the appropriate actions. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time as a leadership team building tools and frameworks to help that happen.",
            "Wendell has spent the majority of his time in our midyear update with the top 250 leaders focused on that. We have rolled some of those tools out across the organization over the last couple months and I feel really good about the systems we\u2019ve built. And those have manifested probably the earliest and in the most external way in some of the financial things that Tony will discuss now."

      "45": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. A lot from a financial standpoint, I\u2019d break things into two categories. One is something that we didn\u2019t change, but instead, we built specifically for times like this and that\u2019s our strong balance sheet. And that makes all the difference in an environment like this because it gives you all kinds of flexibility to be both focused on the long-term investments that we need to make but also be able to change your current operating plan.",
            "We have very strong balance sheet. We had $2.2 billion of cash at the end of the second quarter. We have full access to our revolver and we have a debt structure that is conservative by design. And I think it\u2019s the conservative by design and the relatively unique aspect of that, that I think a lot of times is lost on investors who just tend to look at that total number on the balance sheet and not the way that we\u2019ve designed this.",
            "And we have designed this by designed to be over a very long period of time. We\u2019ve get our average maturity is 25 years, which is the longest in the S&P 500 and 80% of the S&P 500 debts due over the next 20 years and when you look at our debt due over the next 20 years, our coverage ratio is like 1.2 debt to EBITDA. So that debt really means there\u2019s nothing due in the near-term and that doesn\u2019t just have to happen by happenstance. I mean, that is part of the design for an environment like this. That\u2019s what you learn when you\u2019re 170-year old company that that\u2019s the kind of balance sheet that you need.",
            "Now the other thing we did, of course, was to Jeff\u2019s point, this is a new reality and we need to adjust to that new reality is that we just totally adjusted our operating plan. And while we didn\u2019t have the visibility to know exactly what was going to happen in the future, we knew it\u2019s going to be different than what we entered the year and we had to adjust according to that.",
            "So we put a lot of focus on reducing our production levels across our businesses, adjusting our operating expenses, modifying our inventory plans and reducing our capital spending. And we did all of that and that is now paying off for us. And in fact, as we do grow our sales, we\u2019ll be able to -- our profits faster than those sales because of the adjustments that we made here.",
            "And then the final thing, I would say is that, we\u2019re very focused on generating the positive free cash flow for the year. And we\u2019re actually now entering a period of time when we\u2019re not doing a lot of build investments and we\u2019re not doing a lot of build investments, we generate a lot of free cash flow and our free cash flow conversion is very good, is very positive and you saw that in Q2 and you\u2019re going to continue to see that as we go forward."

How do you kind of balance those OpEx reductions or capital investment decisions that kind of were notch down a little bit? And how do you kind of balance that with any upside that you\u2019re seeing in some of the segments that you talked about plus optical, when that seems to come back, how can -- how do you balance those?"

I mean, we really did most of this kind of halfway through the second quarter even though we saw this coming earlier, because we wanted to make sure we had those right discussions and right decision.",
            "But in a lot of cases, it\u2019s looking at the things that are lower probability of success, lower probability of having an impact and just being always doing a prioritization of those. And Jeff did make a reference, we did write-off one of the programs that we thought was promising, but as we got -- as we thought about what\u2019s happening from a pandemic standpoint and as we think about the three, four, five and it fell out of the 80%, that we focus on three, four, five, that was a good place to reduce. So we don\u2019t manage the reductions across all of our businesses, but we go through a prioritization process."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. I\u2019ll give you a couple other examples of how we do that by leveraging. We often talk about our cohesive portfolio and we\u2019ve given examples of how we combine our three and our four to serve different markets. But I think we\u2019ve really seen a couple -- at least a couple prominent ways that we\u2019ve done that over the last few months as a result of COVID.",
            "So we talk about precision forming and how it applies in both our Optical Communications business and our Life Sciences business. As the world has responded to the pandemic, it\u2019s been slow to get permitting, it\u2019s been tough to get people into the field in optical communications in some places, we were actually able to reallocate some of our capacity for doing connectors into making components that fit into diagnostics kits in the Life Sciences business, because a lot of the capabilities of that precision forming have significant overlap.",
            "Another example of doing that is extrusion, which we use in both our Automotive business for catalytic converters and GPS, but also in our Optical Communications business for making optical cable. As the Automotive market was slow in the earlier parts of the year, we were able to use some of that capacity to put GPS capacity against thinking about how to use and test some ideas we have around, how to use the basic GPS filter technology for fixed outdoor air cleaning systems and that\u2019s going to provide us with a lot of data that will help shape those longer term research programs and some of the pilot testing that we\u2019re doing now. Well, that would have -- that was very difficult to do when we were running at full capacity for GPF. So I think another way we cope is to leverage the cohesive -- cohesiveness of our portfolio."

As we wrap up here, a couple of questions that I always get are about Corning\u2019s free cash flow and you guys are obviously talking about positive free cash flow, capital investments being dialed down, so that should generate more. If you can talk -- remind us again, sort of what are your capital allocation priorities in the near-term? And how long do you expect kind of this -- the gravy train to last is it some put it before you have to kind of dial back up your CapEx investments to meet kind of your long-term growth drivers?"

            "And when we have to go back to a significant build capital will just depend on the as our opportunities become available and as we get customer commitments for those. But I think, certainly, as we think about the next 18 months or so, the real focus will be filling up the build capacity that we\u2019ve put in place. And we believe we\u2019re on the right trends to be able to do that and then continue to create new opportunities and sustain our current businesses, but the capital required for that is less than that."
