         "Thanks Sherry and good morning, everybody. I hope all of you are continuing to stay safe and healthy. And although our economy is starting to open up, it's clear we're still far from being able to look in the rearview mirror at the impact of COVID-19. I want to just start first off by giving credit to our staff at Cenovus for keeping our operations running safely and reliably and for adapting to all the additional measures we've put in place in response to the pandemic. It really has been incredible to witness the resiliency of our people and their dedication to looking out for one another.",
         "The field staff have been diligently following the new procedures to prevent the spread of the virus at our sites and camps and staff have embraced technology to remain productive while working virtually. Through all of the changes, our teams remain focused on safety performance. And as an example of that, we had zero significant incidents across our operations in the first half of the year.",
         "And our Deep Basin team achieved a milestone of zero recordable injuries for an entire year, which I think is truly impressive given the conditions that our employees and staff have had to work under. While some of our staff, who were working remotely have gradually started returning to their regular job locations, we are proceeding cautiously to help ensure the safety of our people and the reliability of our operations.",
         "I want to provide details now about our response to the recent downturn, likely the worst quarter our industry has witnessed in recent memory. The second quarter presented commodity price instability beyond what anyone I think ever could have predicted. The sharp drop in oil demand and resulting unprecedented low oil prices experienced early in the quarter had a significant impact on our financial results.",
         "But the extreme volatility also highlighted what sets Cenovus apart from our peers. It presented an opportunity for our marketing and upstream teams to demonstrate why shareholders should have confidence in this company. We are able to leverage our low-cost structure and the flexibility of our assets to strategically access the highest returns for our products and maximize value for shareholders. ",
         "In response to the sharp decline in oil prices in April, we quickly reduced production volumes at our Oil Sands operations, while continuing to steam and store the mobilized oil in the reservoir. When the average price of Western Canadian Select increased almost 10-fold in June, compared with April, we acted fast to ramp up our Oil Sands production back up to take advantage of the improved pricing. Our well cost structure means that with WCS prices at current levels, we are generating free funds flow and strengthening our balance sheet.",
         "During the quarter, essentially all the inventory that we wrote down in March was sold, and we realized the inventory write-downs. That reduced adjusted funds flow and free funds flow by $529 million. Excluding the impact of these write-downs from the first quarter, we would have had positive adjusted funds flow of nearly $70 million in Q2. We've also been purchasing low-cost production credits from peers so that we can produce above our curtailment limit. That allowed us to push our June oil sands production to more than 405,000 barrels per day, including record volumes at our Christina Lake facility.",
         "I cannot overemphasize the value of our ability to take advantage of rapidly changing market conditions. In April, when WCS prices were less than $5 per barrel, we voluntarily reduced oil sand production to an average of just under 344,000 barrels a day. In June, when prices were nearly 10 times that, we ramped up production by 60,000 barrels a day, a more than 17% increase that happened over just a few weeks. At Christina Lake specifically, there was an 80,000 barrel per day difference from our lowest daily production in the second quarter to our highest day in June.",
         "Our Downstream business is designed for flexibility as well, providing opportunities in terms of both timing and location of sales. This meant that in addition to timing our production over the past months, we're also able to use our diversified transportation and storage portfolio to defer sales from April into June when we were seeing higher price signals.",
         "The close working relationship between our marketing and operation teams are giving us a competitive advantage. Their quick action in June resulted in free funds flow for the month of more than $290 million. Meanwhile, the flexibility of our refineries meant that refining runs could be adjusted to take into account refined product demand signals to maximize value for our shareholders there as well. We believe we're on the way to recovery from the low point in the downturn in April, although we expect commodity price volatility for the foreseeable future. We are not counting on a swift recovery.",
         "Second only to the safety of our staff, balance sheet strength remains our priority. This downturn demonstrated the value of our relentless focus on paying down debt, reducing costs and maintaining capital discipline over the past years. You will continue to see that discipline at Cenovus. We finished the quarter with net debt at around $8.2 billion. We remain committed to getting net debt down to $5 billion or below over the longer term. Given the outlook for pricing in the second half of 2020, we anticipate the level of net debt at the end of the second quarter to be the high point for the year. We have worked to ensure we continue to have ample liquidity to withstand a continued period of low oil prices if necessary, and we remain focused on disciplined capital spending. We will be sticking with the reduced 2020 capital budget we announced in April even if the price environment improves over the coming months.",
         "Before I turn to your questions, I want to encourage everyone to check out our environmental, social and governance report that we released last week on cenovus.com. This report provides context for the analysis we performed before setting our ESG focus area targets earlier this year as well as details of our 2019 sustainability performance. We are committed to achieving those targets and to continuously improving our ESG reporting to ensure our shareholders and other stakeholders are fully informed about our performance. I feel this report really raises the bar for our industry when it comes to sustainability disclosure.",
         "With that, I'm happy to take your questions."

            "Thanks, good morning; and thanks for the run down Alex. couple of questions. I guess the first one is \u2013 you mentioned that $5 billion has gone kind of from the target to the upper boundary. As you maybe look at the new world in terms of where oil prices might shake out or what kind of volatility we're facing, is there a lower boundary maybe even in the 3s that you'd be sort of looking at as maybe optimum, optimum in terms of like running a really underlevered balance sheet going forward?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Thanks, Greg. I think it's a really good comment. And I think Jon and I have been quite pointed over the last few months about talking about $5 billion is ultimately an upper band. And I think the easiest way for me to answer that would be to say that our balance \u2013 nothing has emphasized for me the importance of balance sheet than the past four, five months. And it is not going to cause me any loss of sleep at night \u2013 if we don't see compelling opportunities, driving that net debt down below $5 billion is not going to cost me any sleep. And I think that's probably \u2013 directionally, that's probably something that our investors should be thinking about."

      },
      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Terrific. And then maybe a question for Jon maybe just around the hedging. I mean we picked up the hedges you put in. So you've sold, I don't know, 88,000-odd, and then you've got purchases for 56,000, fixed prices. There's a little bit of a differential there, and there's a little bit of work you guys did on the spread. But how should we think about hedging and maybe why those were put in place what have you?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Greg Pardy"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, Greg. What I would tell you is that at a corporate level, nothing has changed. We still see the balance sheet is the right way to ultimately hedge our operations. But one thing you do need to understand about this company is we do have substantial pipeline and storage assets that we use on a daily, monthly basis to optimize our pricing. So the hedge losses that you'll see both on a realized and unrealized basis in the financial statements of Q2 are really related to the optimization work we do in locking in margins around those assets. What we saw in Q2 was some pretty significant contango opportunities in particular, where those assets were quite valuable to us.",
            "So I'll just give you a quick example of how that works on an accounting basis so you're not surprised on a go-forward basis. But if the marketers have an opportunity in May, for example, to sell at $20 or sell forward in June, for example, at $24, we can realize a margin of $4 by storing those barrels for a month and selling them in June. So what they'll do is they'll forward sell them and use a financial derivative to lock in that $4. On the accounting side, what we'll show is \u2013 for example, if June then closes at $40, we'll show a $40 realization but a $16 hedge loss.",
            "So we've locked in the $24 in the month that we'd do it, but what the accounting does is it separates that transaction. So when you see contango opportunities and you see WTI rising through a quarter like this, that's kind of the result you're going to see on a go-forward basis, but it really reflects what we've done to kind of lock in margins as a company."

And when you think about the deleveraging process ahead of you this time around, are there any sort of interim targets to look for before you maybe switch the dividend back on? Or are you now simply concentrating on hitting that $5 billion net debt before we consider other areas to deploy capital?"

We are, as a company, still focused on the three things that Alex has talked about in depth: maintaining costs, balance sheet integrity as well as liquidity. So although we see a lot of green shoots coming out of June and we had a very good month, we are laser-focused on generating free cash flow through the next few months and applying that to the balance sheet before we consider reinstituting the dividend."

But as you think about production ramping up in Canada, how do you think about where the light-heavy differential comes out towards the back end of the year? And when do you think production levels in Canada as a whole return to pre-COVID-19 levels? Thank you."

      },
      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Hey Emily, thanks for the question. And what I would like to say is, when we were sitting in April, we ramped down production. And then coming into June, we saw what I would say record tight differentials. And I think between the low in April to the high in June, we've increased production at Christina Lake by 80,000 barrels a day to capture that record tightness and generate significant free funds flow in the month. As we look forward, that opportunity prevailed because there's significant upstream production off in Canada, and we think that persists through the summer months.",
            "But rightly, as you indicate, as we head into the fall, there could be some additional production coming back on. Now it's uncertain. We think that currently, there's over 500,000 barrels a day still offline in Western Canada. And it's uncertain how much of that actually does come back. But it's something that we will watch very closely. And obviously, we \u2013 if we do see the differential widen and there are economics to restart our rail program for a longer period of time, we will look at that opportunity if it makes economic sense."

            "Hey, good morning. First question, just \u2013 I guess I'll ask one more on the deleveraging. And Jon, I probably asked you this in the past, but is there anything else you think you could do inorganically to accelerate the process of deleveraging, asset sales or otherwise that you would think about, maybe not in this exact environment but as you look ahead, say, 12 to 18 months? Or would you say this is just going to be more of an organic process?"

      "20": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, Phil. I think for your modeling purposes and for general assumptions, you should think of this being an organic process. One thing we've been really clear about is we're not going to do anything to impair the value of FCCL. We certainly see that as family silver, and we're not going to do something in the short term that's going to have long-term implications to the value of that asset. As it relates to the Deep Basin, we've been pretty clear. We've stood down any kind of inorganic process there. We don't think that transaction values today reflect the long-term value of that asset as well.",
            "And then we're pretty happy with, obviously, WRB, which provides us the countercyclical cash flow and insulation against some of the heavy oil and \u2013 differentials that we see in Western Canada. So by and large, you should just assume it's going to be organic."

      "21": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Understood. Second question would be just on the commentary about the June cash flow. Obviously, very strong for the month. Would you say that, that is sustainable as you move through the third quarter? Or were there any onetime factors that contributed to such a strong result on the month. I'm thinking maybe lagged condensate or something else. I'm just curious how you think about the rest of the year playing out."

      "22": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Phil, when you look at June, you're absolutely right, it was a terrific month. And there's pieces of June that I would describe as onetime in order of magnitude, but thematically, going forward, they still exist. Two big drivers for June. One was the differential \u2013 the WTI-WCS differential narrowed to just over $4. So even on a historical basis, that is an extremely tight differential. And then some of the condensate that we were purchasing in April and May started to flow through those June numbers. So in terms of order of magnitude going forward, I don't think you'll see the same kind of performance. But do realize that the differentials are still narrow for both July and August, and the condensate pricing is still quite favorable. So though I don't expect July, August to be as good as June, directionally, they're consistent with June."

So we realized those inventory write-downs that we took at the end of Q1 on a cash basis in Q2. So the total inventory charge that we saw come through was 300 and some on the oil sands side and the residual on the downstream side."

So what you've seen through the quarter is a period of improving performance.

Now that we've ramped it down, we're incurring just the fixed charges, which is about $18 million to $20 million. So that all gets reflected in the transportation cost. Now it doesn't all go to Foster Creek. It really depends on which barrels we move. So it can be both but the true savings is about $60 million a month, which is reflected across the company and our transportation costs."

I'm assuming oil prices will be a factor but also wanted to get your thoughts around availability to utilize more curtailment credits, especially as back half of the year, there's going to be less industry maintenance activity going on. And on the refining demand side, still relatively soft to normal levels. Just want to get your thoughts around how you think about that?"

            "Thanks for the question, Benny. As we look through kind of the back half of the summer, there still is significant turnaround activities happening in the industry that's keeping a fair amount of production offline. So availability of those credits to be able to produce, we think, is going to be there. As we head into the back half of the year, there's still a big question mark about how much of that production actually does come back, and that will really drive the availability of acquiring those credits.",
            "But I would reiterate that if the differentials do widen, we do have a rail program there that can generate production credits as well. And the way we stopped the program is in a fashion that we have our cars stored at both our Bruderheim facility and some of our U.S. destinations to enable us to quickly ramp the program back up if the economics make sense and we see a structural reason to want to do that for a longer period of time."

            "That\u2019s great. Thanks Keith. Appreciate your thoughts there. My follow-up is more for Alex. I guess I just wanted to tap into your extensive midstream and pipeline experience and get your perspective around the headlines we've been seeing around Line 5 and DAPL. How do you think about the risk, particularly if you see an extended shutdown of those pipelines? And just more broadly, is this an early indication of an even tougher environment ahead of us for just energy infrastructure overall?"

            "Yes. I mean it's a really good question, Benny. And I wish \u2013 I'm not sure my experience gives me any deeper insight. But I guess I'd respond maybe specifically to Cenovus, and then maybe I'll respond more broadly. With respect to our business, we're \u2013 we don't see DAPL or Line 5 really having significant implications for our business. We do think it could obviously have some impact on the lighter grades. But for us, we're not \u2013 we don't see it as particularly material.",
            "But I think as an industry, my own personal observation, DAPL I think is a great example of a pipeline that went through an incredibly exhaustive environmental review in regulatory process, which finally, after extended debate, it received all of its permits. It's been in operation for two or three years, and we now have a judge who is \u2013 who believes that it's appropriate to take that infrastructure out of service while we debate the environment \u2013 some environmental aspects.",
            "So I think that's quite concerning. And I hope it is \u2013 I hope that the legal issue is dispensed with very quickly, and everything gets back to normal. And this is not an issue for the oil industry. I mean, we're seeing this on basically all infrastructure across North America, so I think it is a significant issue. From my perspective, I \u2013 we identified \u2013 probably the first day I got here, I identified that one of the biggest challenge for Cenovus was market access and egress.",
            "And as I've said to many people, hope and prayer isn't a strategy, and we need to have plans particularly in a world where we may see continued challenges to pipelines. And that's why you've seen us do the things we've done to secure more pipeline capacity, the work we've done on supporting Enbridge\u2019s contract carrier regulatory application and the early work that we did on the DRU. And all of that was from a perspective of creating options in a world where it might be more challenging."

If I could go to Slide 10, which was, I think, fairly interesting, on Christina Lake production volumes and I think shows that you've managed your volumes pretty well with WCS. And I think, Alex, you mentioned 80,000 barrels a day swing. My question is, Christina Lake has low SOR and a low operating cost, I think, in the $6 to $7 range. How does operating costs fluctuate when you shift volumes this sharply? Is there an impact on operating costs?"

So for a short period of time, our steam oil ratio went from what was normally two up to 2.1. It will go back down sub two again throughout the year. So relatively speaking, it just stays flat. We are 15% year-on-year down from 2019. But our OpEx will stay within the guidelines that we've provided earlier."

            "Yes, Asit. Obviously, pretty commercially sensitive information, but what I would say is what we saw through the second quarter was significant upstream production turned off. So the availability of those credits, they're readily available. We see that kind of persisting through the back half of the summer, kind of the July, August time frame as turnarounds are getting extended in \u2013 with some of our peers and therefore, more production remains offline than maybe originally envisioned.",
            "What I would say, as you head into the fall, obviously, doing turnarounds in Canada in the winter is not a good idea. So we do expect some of that production to come back. And the critical part will be relative to the overall curtailment levels the Alberta government has set and the amount of production offline and the amount of rail that's moving. Are we in an essentially balanced market or is there additional egress challenges?",
            "And then how quickly does rail ramp up to meet those egress challenges. All of that will then determine kind of where the differential settles and the economics of railing. And the government also has the program in place that if you rail, you do generate additional production credit. So in an economic \u2013 where that makes sense economically, we would look at turning our program back on."
