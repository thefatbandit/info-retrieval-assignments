         "This is Takeshi Isobe. Please refer the presentation material. Today's presentation will focus on three points, the fiscal 2020 first quarter financial results. Our financial forecast for fiscal 2020 and our capital allocation policy. Page 4, starting this fiscal year, we are reclassifying our segments. We disclose the details in a press release issued on July 28. So, let me just touch on the key points. With the transformation of our business model that we have been working on for the past several years, we have been trained to concentrate our management resources, our technology solutions. Because our business structure has changed considerably, we have decided to reclassify our segments. ",
         "First, I will explain the segment classification. Until now, we have four business systems, technology solutions, ubiquitous solutions, device solutions, and other elimination and corporate. Now, we have put other elimination and corporate under technology solutions.",
         "As a result, there will now be three segments plus elimination, which refers to the elimination of sales among segments. As medium term targets for technology solutions, we aim for revenue of \u00a53.5 trillion, and an operating profit margin of 10% by fiscal 2022. ",
         "Next, I'd like to briefly describe the sub segments within technology solutions, there are two main changes. The first point is how we will classify the business outside of Japan, up until now services and system platforms each included descriptions or performance for the business outside of Japan. But now we are separating that out and aggregating it into a new sub segment called international regions, excluding Japan. The second point is our treatment of companywide expenses, up until now, we treated large scale upfront investments, such as investments in the cloud, or a next generation super computers, as companywide shared expenses that would generate group wide returns. The scale of investments has already peaked for several projects, with the objective of clarifying their responsibilities for generating returns on those investments. We are now putting these R&D expenses into their respective sub segments. We will disclose our financial results in the segment from fiscal 2020. ",
         "We will now turn to the financial results on Page five. Page five. In the bold outline, we have a summary of the consolidated results for the first quarter fiscal 2020. Revenue was \u00a5802.7 billion down \u00a535.9 billion. The impact of COVID-19 reduced revenue by \u00a535.8 billion mainly in technology solutions. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19, revenue was essentially unchanged from the previous year. But there were differences among the segments. Revenue and technology solutions increasing. In system platforms the Fugaku supercomputer along with the demand, supply chain base stations caused revenue to increase. In ubiquitous solutions revenue declined significantly in comparison with the previous year when there is extraordinary demand relating to Windows 7. Revenue also declined in Device Solutions because of the impact of business restructuring. Operating profit was JPY22.2 billion, an increase over the previous year of JPY18.8 billion. In addition to the profitability of multiple businesses increasing the higher profit was attributable to lower operating expenses. Financial income, expenses, et cetera, amounted to JPY3.6 billion, a slight increase from the prior year. At the bottom, profit for the period are attributed to the owners of the parent was JPY18.1 billion.",
         "Next is page seven. We present increases and decreases in three categories as we did last year. The impact of restructuring comes from the impact of the semiconductor, which was excluded from the consolidated results from the second half of last year. The special items in comparison with last year shows the impact of not having the burden of last year's restructuring expenses for Device Solutions. Excluding these factors in comparison with last year, revenue declined by JPY21.5 billion and operating profit increased by \u00a512.3 billion.",
         "Page 8. I would like to now a comment on the factors that cause increases or decreases in operating profit compared to the prior year. On the far left, operating profit in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was JPY3.3 billion. I will use this as a starting point for explaining increases or decreases from the prior year. The first I'll put arrow, since the impact of not having the burden of last year special items and restructuring expenses, which in total reduced last year's operating profit by JPY6.4 billion.",
         "The next I'll put arrow is, positive JPY3.8 billion. This was the increase in operating profit resulting from higher revenue of JPY14.3 billion, mainly from the increase in revenue and Systems Platform. The next upward arrow is JPY8.2 billion. The profitability in operating segment in Technology Solutions, Ubiquitous Solutions and Device Solutions improved. In Technology Solutions, the improvement was mainly for mainframes and software for which profitability is especially high in Ubiquitous Solution in addition to a positive change in product mix towards high spec products, we were able to maintain pricing in pricing. Device Solutions, there was a significant improvement in electronic components.",
         "The next upward arrow is JPY12.3 billion from greater efficiencies and operating expenses. The expense of the upfront development projects decreased, as investments of several projects had already peaked out and switched into the revenue generating phase. There were also improvements to efficiency for the development of x86 servers due to changes to the global development organizational structure.",
         "In addition, because of the instrumentation of remote working for group employees, following the declaration of a state of emergency in Japan in April, there was a reduction in business travel expenses and all kinds of events were either canceled or at least online, resulting in a significant decline in first quarter expenses. The last downward arrow in red is impact of COVID-19. There was a negative impact of revenue of JPY35.8 billion, a decline of about 4%. There was a negative impact on operating profit of \u00a512.1 billion. Adding everything together operating profit in the first quarter was JPY22.2 billion.",
         "Page 9. I'd like to give some supplemental information on changes in revenue from the prior year in our businesses excluding special items.",
         "In the center of the table, we have actual results in the first quarter and the comparisons with the prior year. To the right of the table, we present the breakdown of changes from the prior year. ",
         "Total revenue declined by \u00a521.5 billion from the previous year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 revenue would've increased by \u00a514.3 billion as COVID-19 reduced revenue by \u00a535.8 billion. If you look at technology solutions there was a slight \u00a51.9 billion improvement in revenue compared to the prior year, excluding the impact of COVID-19 revenue and solution services increased mainly from public sector projects that continued from the previous year. Revenue in system platform was sharply from Fugaku mainstream deals, and an increased in demand for 5G base stations. ",
         "As a result, technology solutions covered the decline caused by COVID-19 and we posted an increase in revenue. In ubiquitous solutions revenue declined by \u00a529 billion a sharp decrease from last year due to the impact of last year, special demand. ",
         "Page 10, here I would like to comment on the status of orders in Japan. On an unconsolidated basis orders in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 declined by 9%, the impact of the comparison with last year special demand PCs is significant, but even if we exclude that impact, orders decline by 3%, as I just explained due to strong orders last year, revenue in the first quarter for technology solutions was able to cover the impact of COVID-19. ",
         "On the other hand, orders which represent future revenue declined from the previous year's first quarter, because the orders were especially strong during the same period last year, but also because of the impact of COVID 19. Looking back on past economic slowdowns, because there are many large scale and long-term projects in Fujitsu, changes in business results tend to lag behind economic trends. ",
         "While, there are variations among industry sectors revenues from the second quarter onward might be weak due to the weak order demand, so we are focusing on trends in our orders. ",
         "Page 11, this slide shows the impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter, that'd be negative impacts such as delays in projects and business deals have been stagnant. On the other hand, they have also been positive impacts for new demand. So I would explain both the negative and positive impacts.",
         "Revenue was reduced by \u00a565.5 billion as a result of negative impact. For some projects mainly in the manufacturing distribution and healthcare sectors and implementation timing was pushed back. In addition deal activity, stagnated for small and medium sized enterprises customers, there was a slight impact on our supply chain, but that started to recover in April and now our supply chain has nearly recovered.",
         "Outside of Japan, primarily in Europe and Asia, we were impacted by severe lockdowns and the impacts were relatively large in comparison with Japan. On the other hand revenue rose by \u00a529.6 billion as a result of positive impacts, there were increases in revenue for new demand such as the expansion of PCs and infrastructure, as well as provisions of solutions stemming from numeric work. ",
         "Page 13. Now let me explain our segment results primarily in relation to last year's results. First is technology solutions. Revenue was \u00a5679.1 billion, slightly higher than last year, operating profit was \u00a512.6 billion an increase of \u00a55 billion from last year. Now I will explain the details of each sub segment.",
         "Page 14 solution services segment. Revenue was \u00a5376.8 billion down 3.1% from the prior year. Revenue from the public sector increased mainly from projects that have been ongoing from last year. But revenue in the sub segment declined because of the impact COVID-19. Implementation timing was disappointing for new projects, mainly in the manufacturing, distribution and healthcare sectors. Operating profit was \u00a517.8 billion, essentially unchanged from the previous year. Despite the impact of lower revenue as a result from COVID-19 operating profit remains essentially the same because of improvements in profitability, such as from increases in software and greater efficiency than operating expenses.",
         "Page 15, systems platforms. Revenue was \u00a5151.7 billion, a 24% increase over the prior year in addition to the shipment of Fujitsu on the increase in mainframe deals, there was an increase in demand for 5G base stations, a revenue increase for both system products and regular products. Operating profit was \u00a55 billion an improvement of \u00a511.5 billion over the prior year. In addition to the effects of higher revenue on the improvement in profitability from higher mainframe sales, there was also greater efficiencies in operating expenses, leading to a significant improvement.",
         "Page 16, international regions excluding Japan. Revenue was \u00a5171 billion down 8.2% from the previous year. In addition to the impact of COVID-19, there were adverse changes in exchange rates exist from unprofitable countries in Europe, and an exit from a product business in North America that resulted in lower revenue. There was an operating loss of \u00a53.7 billion. The impact from the decline of revenues loss resulting in a deterioration of \u00a53.2 billion from the prior year. ",
         "Page 17, ubiquitous solutions. Revenue was \u00a5 73.8 billion down 28.3% from the prior year. Revenue decline from the prior year, when there was a special demand for upgrades relating to Windows 7. Operating profit was \u00a5 4.2 billion, an increase of \u00a5 0.6 billion from the prior year. Although the impact of the decline in revenue was significant. There was an increase in the proportion of sales accounted for by high spec product. There was an improvement in profitability because sales prices could be maintained. ",
         "Page 18, device solutions. Revenue was \u00a568.3 billion down 18.1% from the prior year, excluding the decline in revenues \u00a514.3 billion from business restructuring revenue was almost flat. Operating profit was \u00a55.3 billion and improvement is \u00a513.1 billion from the prior day. It was a positive impact \u00a56.4 billion from last year business model transformation expenses and business restructuring. Improvements in the profitability of electronic components improve profit in actual business results, excluding the impact of special items by \u00a56.6 billion. ",
         "Page 19, cash flows. Cash flows from operating activities was \u00a5148.8 billion. This is an increase of \u00a532.5 billion from the previous year, mainly from higher profits and lower inventory asset. Categories from investing activities were a net outflow of \u00a510 billion essentially unchanged from the prior year. Free cash flow was \u00a5138.8 billion. ",
         "Slide 20. This is the balance of assets, liabilities and equity. Total equity was \u00a51,343.5 billion. Equity [indiscernible] ratio shareholder's equity ratio was 41.4%. This represents an increase of 2.5 percentage points from the end of the prior fiscal year. The improvement is attributable to higher profits and progress in reducing assets.",
         "Page 22. I will now discuss how full quarter fiscal 2020, which we refrained from announcing at the beginning of the fiscal year. These are some assumptions behind our forecast. We formulated to forecast based on the assumption that a stagnation and economic activity stemming from the impact of COVID-19 bottomed out in the first quarter, that there would be a recovery in the second and third quarters, and that corporate activity was fully reopened in the first quarter. Very recently, we have seeing infections spread again. We are not assuming another major weakening of economic activity, mainly because of the emergency measures being taken. In terms of the impact on our financial results, in Japan, we have seen another major impact on earnings from customers in the manufacturing, distribution, retailing and health tech sectors. Outside of Japan, in addition to major speculations and economic activity due to severe locales, the foundations of our business are still relatively weak compared with Japan. So, we expect it will take time for our business to recover",
         "Page 23. This is our financial forecast for fiscal 2020. We expect our revenue, JPY3,610 billion, a decline of JPY247.7 billion from the prior year. We have assumed a declining revenue of JPY110 billion coming from COVID-19, mainly in Technology Solutions. Aside from that, we expect revenue Ubiquitous Solutions to decline compared to last year, when there was a special demand. We expect operating profit of JPY212 billion, essentially unchanged from the prior year. We expect variations among the segments, which we'll explain in a chart. We expect profit for the year of JPY116 billion yen, essentially flat.",
         "Page 24. Here, I will discuss the factors affecting changes in operating profit, compared to last year. On the far left is fiscal 2019 operating profit of JPY211.4 billion. I will use this as my starting point in explaining changes from last year. The first I'll put arrow is the impact of not having last year's burden of special items and restructuring impacts, which reduced operating profit by JPY14.5 billion.",
         "The next I'll put arrow is an increase of JPY45.9 billion in operating profit in Technology Solutions. In addition to improved profitability in solutions services and an increase in demand 5G base stations, we expect to appreciate efficiencies and operating expenses. The next downward arrow is a decline in operating profit of JPY24.4 billion in Ubiquitous Solutions. The expected declined reflect the comparison with last year where there was special demand. The next I'll put arrow is an increase of JPY12.4 billion in Device Solutions.",
         "We are predicting higher per month and improved profitability in electronic components. The next downward arrow in red is the impact of COVID-19. We expect revenue to decline by JPY110 billion, roughly 3% reflected in the decline in operating profit of JPY38 billion. The last downward arrow in gray represents as this fiscal year special item JPY10 billion in business transformation expenses, we've included in Technology Solutions. Taken together, we expect operating profit of JPY212 billion for fiscal 2020.",
         "Page 26. Here, I will discuss our expectations for the full year impact of COVID-19. From negative impact, we expect revenue to be reduced by \u00a5178 billion and operating income to be reduced by \u00a560 billion. On the other hand from positive impacts we expect revenue to be increased by \u00a568 billion and operating profit to be increased by \u00a522 billion. We expect the total impact, therefore, to be a reduction in revenue of \u00a5110 billion and the reduction operating profit of \u00a538 billion. ",
         "I have already touched upon the negative impacts. So, here I will comment on our expectations regarding the timing of the recovery. In Japan we expect such sectors as manufacturing and distribution to bounce back spotting in fourth quarter and we expect to full fledged recovery in the first half of next fiscal year. Outside of Japan we expect severe conditions to continue through the fiscal year and we expect the recovery next fiscal year and beyond. ",
         "On the other hand, there are also positive impacts, a large proportion of the positive impact stem from dealing with the right work. But aside from that, we expect to provide solutions that are needed for society in the new normal era. ",
         "Page 27, on the top of the page, we present areas in which he can reimagine business for the new normal era. Based on such keywords as digital, promotes, labor savings and touchless we'll deliver solutions needed in each industry sector and aim to contribute to greater trust in society while also expanding our business through new opportunities. ",
         "At the books worth of page, we have work life shift and we will promote changes in the ways people work. We expect a certain reduction in expenses, but we simultaneously expect to deliver improvements in productivity and employee satisfaction, not stopping at cost cutting measures. We will also establish the solutions needed to achieve these objectives and comparison customers. ",
         "Page 28 and 29 have details on the full cost each segment. So please refer to them and all supplemental materials.",
         "Page 30, this is our full cost for cash flows. We expect free cash flow of \u00a5170 billion because this year we will not have the cash inflows from the state of businesses and the sale of shares we expect free cash flow to be \u00a563 billion lower than last year. ",
         "Page 31, this is our plan for dividend in fiscal 2020. We are planning to pay an interim dividend of \u00a5100 per share and then end of year dividend of \u00a5100 per share for total of \u00a5200 per share. This represents an annual increase in dividends of \u00a520, overall profit forecast for this year is essentially flat. We expect to be able to maintain a certain enough in the profits and sound financial foundation, therefore in accordance with our policy. We plan to have stable increases in dividends. ",
         "Lastly I'd like to explain our capital allocation policy. First I will discuss the directions of our financial strategy, deploying the capital allocation policy. The basis will be a solid financial foundation as a company supporting societal infrastructure, maintaining sustainability that can withstand short term changes in our business environment is more important than anything else. ",
         "The present circumstances including the COVID-19 pandemic certainly drive from this point. On top of that, we seek to strike a good balance between strategic growth investments and stable improvements in shareholder returns leading to continuous improvements in corporate value. ",
         "Page 34, discharge shows an overall summary of our capital allocation policy based on the direction I just mentioned. This is a major concept. And we think we need to go a bit beyond the financial targets we have set to achieve in fiscal 2022. And we are thinking of a range over the next five years. The first point is cash flows, the funding source offering the basis for allocations. Over the next five years, we seek to generate over \u00a51 million with free cash flow. The second point is the allocation of those funds. Based on our financial foundation, we seek an optimal distribution of cash between growth investments and shareholder returns.",
         "Next, I'll discuss each section, Page 35. First, I'll discuss the source of funds and how we seek to generate a stable cash flow. In addition to cash flow generated from the growth in our business, we will generate additional cash by optimizing our existing assets. The diagram below illustrates concept . The basic business cash flow is a cash flow generated from our core continuing businesses. In addition to this for optimizing our existing assets, through sales across shareholdings, and non core assets, we'll further concentrate on our core business. By combining these two, we seek to generate over \u00a51 trillion in free cash flow over the next five years. ",
         "Page 36. Next, I would like to discuss our thoughts about capital allocation. First, we will maintain a solid financial foundation. In recent years, we have worked to strengthen our financial foundation, when it may not yet be solid as a rock, we have been working to achieve to a certain degree a healthy financial foundation. We plan to achieve further improvements by improving capital efficiency, and we do not expect to need additional cash anytime soon. Taking the current global economy into consideration, we will move forward while paying close attention to the funding environment.",
         "Page 37, the second point of our capital allocation is that our highest priority is on gross investments. As CEO Taketa mentioned in this presentation we will actively invest in creating value to deliver to our customers and to transform Fujitsu into a digital transformation company. Over the next five years, we've tried to make investments of \u00a5500 billion to \u00a5600 billion. The details of the investments are as shown on the slide. Making gross investments, we will thoroughly monitor the returns on each investment and use discipline in our investments for growth. ",
         "Page 38. Third point of capital allocation is shareholder returns. Based on the growth stage of our business and profits we seek to generate stable and continuous improvements in shareholder returns over the medium and long term, we plan to make stable dividends. While we cannot predict our future business environment, we are working to be able to increase our dividend payments in fiscal 2020. In addition, if we have surplus funds accumulated over long-term, we will use them to make share repurchases. When implementing such repurchases, we will make agile determinations in consideration of the economic environment and the supply demand balance of funds. ",
         "That concludes my discussion of our capital allocation policy. ",
         "Lastly, Fujitsu will strengthen its ability to generate cash and flow by the optimal allocation of cash flow will seek to grow its business and improve its earnings and capital efficiency. We'll focus on EPS in terms of capital efficiency, as we aim to grow our business and improve profitability through our financials targets of improving the growth in our revenue and operating profit margin. We will make steady efforts to ensure sustained growth in the EPS over the medium to long-term.",
         "In this new normal era, Fujitsu hope to contribute to the establishment of more resilient society, new lifestyles and ways of thinking which mark a departure from the pre-COVID era are starting to emerge. Again, Fujitsu would like to contribute to making a more flexible and resilient society by leveraging our technologies to realize values in society from the perspective of what would be an ideal state for society and customers.",
         "That concludes my presentation."
