      "As we navigate through these challenging times, we have never lost sight of ensuring the health and safety of our customer and employees. More than 70% of our workforce continues to productively work from home, where most will remain into 2021. Those in our branches, business centers, operation and call centers, are well protected through the many measures we have put in place and are providing our customer with the financial resources and advice they need. We continue to support our customers with numerous programs including payment deferrals. With the economy gradually reopening and individuals and businesses adjusting to the new realities, many customers will request that the deferrals at the beginning of the pandemic had since resumed payments.": [
         "At the end of the third quarter, the loan value of deferred payments stood at $1.8 billion, $2.6 billion lower than at the end of the second quarter. This represents 5.5% of the loan portfolio compared to 13.3% last quarter. Over the course of the pandemic, we have taken measures to preserve the financial strength and stability of the bank. Capital and liquidity have always been managed prudently and continue to be during these uncertain times. The CET1 ratio at 9.4% on the standardized basis is strong and is 240 basis points above the regulatory minimum. Our track record on the credit front is solid and it\u2019s reported by our rigorous underwriting. We have minimal exposure to sectors most impacted by COVID-19 such as restaurants, travel, hotels and office towers.",
         "With respect to our transformation plan, our 100% advice model continues to gain momentum. We took the next step during the quarter and replaced non-advice based position with 70 new assistant advisor/customer service position. These employees support the client advisor relationship and business development. We also continue to right-size our Quebec retail network as we aim to improve efficiency. We merged 14 branches with an additional 6 to be merged in the fourth quarter. At the same time, we opened the third Laurentian Bank Financial Group service point in Laval, just north of Montreal, the second most populous city in Quebec. All service points or hubs, post a multidisciplinary team of retail advisors, private bankers, commercial account managers and securities brokers. By helping our customers improve their financial health, we are sowing the seeds for growth.",
         "In addition to keeping the bank and our customers safe and secure, we aim to continue our transformation and we need to improve profitability. We have started to review our cost structure in our operation as well as all our lines of business and their products, segments and niches, all of this to improve our performance and generate profitable growth for the bank. To our employees, I would like to express my gratitude for their resilience during these challenging times and their dedication to serving our customer. [Foreign Language] And now, I will ask Fran\u00e7ois Laurin to provide a more in-depth review of our third quarter financial results. Fran\u00e7ois?"

      "Fran\u00e7ois Laurin": [
         "Thank you, St\u00e9phane and good morning. I would like to begin by turning to Slide 5. As St\u00e9phane mentioned, third quarter net income increased from the prior period as the provision for credit losses declined and efficiency improved. As outlined on Slide 6, adjusting items for the third quarter totaled $0.25 per share, mostly related to severance costs and provisions for lease terminations.",
         "Slide 7 highlights total revenue in the third quarter of 2020 of $248.6 million or 4% higher sequentially. Net interest income increased by $2.8 million compared to last quarter mainly due to wider Prime/BA spread and the additional days in the quarter. This was partially offset by the impact of lower loans to business customers due in part to the effect of the pandemic, which amplified the seasonality of our inventory financing activities.",
         "As shown on Slide 8, NIM for the third \u2013 in the third quarter of 2020 was 1.86%, down 2 basis points sequentially, reflecting the lower volume of higher yielding loans to business customers. The proportion of commercial loans in the portfolio stood at 39% compared to 40% last quarter. Other income as presented on Slide 9 totals $75.1 million. The increase from last quarter reflected the strong contribution from capital markets, which increased by $6.4 million. In particular, the fixed income business performed very well due to strong new issuances and the high level of client activity. Capital markets revenues also benefited from the strong market recovery experienced in the third quarter.",
         "Slide 10 highlights adjusted non-interest expenses of $169.2 million. This 6% sequential decrease was mainly due to lower regulatory cost as well as lower professional fees, advertising and business development costs, ensuing from efficiency measures and the current economic conditions. Partially offsetting these savings was a compensation charge of $2.7 million related to the bank\u2019s former President and CEO\u2019s retirement. We expect that non-interest expenses in the fourth quarter will be slightly higher than in the third quarter. The adjusted efficiency ratio of 68.1% in the third quarter of 2020 improved by 670 basis points from the second quarter. We expect this ratio to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter as revenues are anticipated to be slightly lower due to the lower level of loans to business customers and potentially lower revenues from capital markets as \u2013 and as expenses might be slightly higher.",
         "Slide 11 highlights our well-diversified sources of funds. In the third quarter of 2020, deposits stood at $24.6 billion, down 3% from the second quarter and in line with the reduction in loans. Personal deposits in our branches continue to gradually increase. Term deposits from brokers and advisors declined as we adjust rates according to our funding needs. Digital direct-to-customer deposits stood at about $600 million relatively in line with expectations.",
         "Slide 12 presents the CET1 ratio under the standardized approach of a $9.4 million \u2013 9.4% sorry, at July 31, 2020 compared to 8.8% at April 30. The increase mainly reflects the $1 billion reduction in risk weighted assets, resulting from COVID-19. CET1 also includes 10 basis points resulting from the applications of OSFI\u2019s transitional arrangements for the provisioning of expected credit losses in line with the second quarter. This level of capital provides the bank with the flexibility to resume growth and support the strategic plan, while prudently taking into account economic conditions. Our diversified loan portfolio is shown on Slide 14 and stands at $32.8 billion. This 3% decline compared with the end of the second quarter mainly reflects the impact of COVID-19 on inventory financing activities.",
         "Slide 15 highlights our residential mortgage portfolio. At July 31, 2020, 53% of our mortgages were insured. Our Alt-A portfolio represented 8% of the total of the mortgage book and 4% of the total loan portfolio. Side 16 highlights our well-diversified commercial loan portfolio, which is Pan-Canadian with a U.S. presence and stood at $12.7 billion at the end of July. During the quarter, loans to business customers declined by $800 million, mostly related to the reduction in inventory financing volumes. In response to COVID-19, we continue to work with our customers who may need flexibility in managing their loans.",
         "As shown on Slide 17, during the third quarter, we \u2013 new relief of $640 million was authorized, $812 million was extended for up to an additional 3 months, and $3.3 billion of relief expired. Payment deferrals accounted for 5.5% of the loan portfolio at the end of July compared to 13.3% at the end of April.",
         "Turning to Slide 18, in the third quarter of 2020, the provision for credit losses was $22.3 million compared with $54.9 million in the second quarter and $12.1 million a year ago. In line with our disciplined approach to modeling expected credit losses, we updated our forward-looking economic scenarios to assess collective provisions as at July 31, 2020. These scenarios \u2013 these new scenarios considered the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. They mainly reflect the steeper recession and the slower expected economic recovery.",
         "Our three scenarios base, upside and downside were probability weighted with higher weights assigned to the base and downside scenarios and the smaller residual weight assigned to the upside scenario as part of our approach to determining the expected credit losses as at July 31, 2020. Specifically, credit losses on personal loans in the third quarter of 2020 decreased by $16.3 million. This mainly relates to the increase in allowances recorded in the second quarter to reflect this significant increase in credit risk due to COVID-19. In addition, the sharp rebound during the third quarter in the S&P/TSX index, which is a sensitive factor for modeling allowances for personal investment loans prompted the reversal in Stage 2 \u2013 in Stage 1 and 2 allowances.",
         "Compared to a year ago credit losses decreased by $1.5 million. Credit losses on residential mortgage loans increased by $1.6 million sequentially and by $0.9 million year-over-year, reflecting the steeper recession and the slower expected economic recovery. However, they remain at relatively low levels, reflecting strong underwriting criteria in the robust Canadian housing market. Credit losses on commercial loans in the third quarter decreased by $18.9 million sequentially. This decrease is mainly related to the increase in allowances recorded in the second quarter to reflect the higher credit risk due to COVID-19. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, PCL increased by $10.8 million, reflecting a slight unfavorable migration of the portfolio as well as individual allowances on a limited number of newly impaired loans to business customers.",
         "As shown on Slide 19, the provision for credit losses as a percentage of average loans was 27 basis points for the third quarter of 2020 compared to 67 basis points in the previous period. This ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry, reflecting our disciplined underwriting standards and the strength of our collateral. The magnitude of the COVID-19 impact on the Canadian and U.S. economies is highly uncertain. Therefore, it remains difficult to predict whether the increase in expected credit losses will result in significant write-offs or if the bank will need to recognize additional increases in expected credit losses in subsequent periods.",
         "Impaired loans as shown on \u2013 are shown on Slide 20. Gross impaired loans totaled $274.3 million, up $39.1 million sequentially. This \u2013 sorry, the increase mainly resulted from a few commercial exposure as well as from a slight deterioration in personal loans. Short-term, a lot of uncertainty remains regarding the future course of the pandemic and the performance of the economy. But as the economic wanes and we gain greater clarity, we will update our medium-term objectives. Thank you for your attention.",

         "Good day, bonjour and welcome to the Third Quarter Results 2020 for Laurentian Bank Financial Group. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Susan Cohen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am."
      ],
      "St\u00e9phane Therrien": [
         "Thank you, Susan and good morning everyone. Today, we reported financial results for the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted net income was $47.1 million, about 3x higher than in the second quarter and 9% lower than a year ago. Adjusted EPS and ROE were $1.02 and 7.7% respectively. When compared to last quarter, a reduction in provision for credit losses from the elevated second quarter level and adjusted lower non-interest expenses reflecting the current environment and the cost control measures we have been implementing contributed to the improvement.",
         "Revenues from capital markets were also higher resulting from strong client activity in fixed income and good market performance. When compared to last year, higher model-driven PCLs reflecting a deterioration in macroeconomic variables used in forward-looking scenarios overshadowed improvements on other fronts. The pandemic impacted our growth. In particular, loan to business customers fell by 6% sequentially, mainly due to lower inventory financing volumes. With many Canadian and Americans staying close to own, demand increased for RVs and boats, dealers were unable to replenish their inventory as manufacturers were impacted by production disruptions. While favorable from a credit perspective, as dealers\u2019 repayments were faster than in the past, it was unfavorable from a growth perspective as the utilization rates of our customers\u2019 credit facilities were significantly lower. Growth is expected to resume in the fourth quarter, but lower inventory financing balance are expected to slightly impact net interest income and margins. Mortgage loans were stable during the quarter. Furthermore, the proportion of insured mortgage increased to 53% and the average loan to value was 59%, underlying the strong credit quality of the portfolio."

This summer season was strongly impacted as we said by COVID-19 changing customer behaviors with increased discretionary spending being redirected toward RVs, trailers, marine asset driving line utilization to an historical low for Northpoint of 37.4%. So, with the OEM manufacturer efforts and production to respond to this increased demand as well as an expectation that the fall season will slow down the purchase cycle, we can expect credit line utilization increasing to a more normalized level in Q1 of 2021."

            "Good morning, Meny. So, as you rightly point out, the government support was appreciable. We had over 8 million Canadians receiving the CERB and they just obviously recently announced a slight extension to that. So, we have taken into account that government support as we evaluate our credit perspective with our retail customers. I would note that we are adequately reserved for that drop-off. We do look as part of our adjudication framework and our disciplined underwriting standards at how the customer \u2013 what customers receive that support and we factored that into our considerations around the reserves. What I would say though is that and I would note the OSFI announcement on guidance from the banks recently released speaks to keeping your loans that have deferrals in Stage 2. What we have done in terms of the clients receiving deferrals is that we have factored in migration of those loans within our reserves and we have an overlay to address that migration. So I would not anticipate a material impact on our reserves from that migration assuming the economic scenarios play out as expected."

As we mentioned before, the bank regularly reviews its financial planning network in order to optimize our geographic presence to better response to its customer behaviors or moving away from branch visit to self-service platform. This, as you mentioned, this has resulted in the decision to reduce the number of clinics by 14 to 69 and we expect to merge an additional 6 in Q4. All these cancellations that we have announced represent locations that are within 2 to 3 kilometers from each other. So far, clients are reacting very well to our 100% advice focus. And going forward, we are taking individual decision based on lease that are needed to be renewed and also a desire to change the \u2013 the design of our branches to a more modern look.

And it did seem to be obvious that businesses have confidence issues right now and then that\u2019s suppressing demand, is that something that could lay on your growth into 2021?"

The growth we are seeing a pipeline being built up right now in the in real estate, commercial real estate so we feel good about again this portfolio. Our portfolio in our leasing arm will build as the economy stabilized. So, we feel good with this portfolio as well, for the rest of the bank, with respect of our residential mortgages, our portfolio has been stable for the last past two quarters. The environment has been highly competitive and our appetite is for profitable growth, but still, it has been stable for the last four \u2013 two quarters. So we feel good about this. But as we navigate through the pandemic, all line of business, are focusing on where they can win in order to resume growth. And for your question in terms of business services, we still feel very positive about our current portfolio. We are not active in industries that have been mostly impacted by COVDI-19 obviously with Northpointe, but it\u2019s kind of a negative, positive type of news.

They are down sequentially and that makes sense, similar traction of government support programs, but they are down materially from last year, last year COVID wasn\u2019t even on the radar. It doesn\u2019t seem to make sense and it does diverge with what I am seeing elsewhere."

We have reserved for a migration of those accounts into Stage 2 and thinking about it longer term and business deferrals right now are really quite, because they are only 3% of or about $360 million in terms of skip payments. We have a very strong portfolio, it\u2019s 98% collateralized. Also, we have seen in terms of the blip last quarter, it was really driven, as Fran\u00e7ois described in his remarks on the volatility in the equity markets and the investment loan piece, but overall, the stages reflect the high credit quality of our portfolio."

But we have reserved for 100% of the clients that are on their second deferral migrating to Stage 2, it may not show up in Stage 2, but we have applied an overlay and for 50% of the mortgages that are insured and in \u2013 sorry are in Stage 1, we have taken a reserve against those. I also would note that our loan devalue on our mortgages in the mid-50s as was described. So, we are already taking a management overlay against that away from that on the personal book, we don\u2019t have a lot of deferrals, mind you, our Visa book and the rest is flight. And as I said, our business referrals are really quite small and only 3% of outstanding.

So we have absolutely looked at the commercial book, we are highly collateralized. And our process involves driving out the model, which that we did a business by business overview, with the business with credit going file by file. We have done some rewriting of a lot of our commercial accounts over the past while that\u2019s reflected in our numbers. We are very comfortable with the reserves. So absolutely and in this environment, you have to do that it\u2019s only prudent. The key question is really how it plays out from here.

So I am very comfortable with that 70%, 80% are in equipment finance with the balance in real estate, as I mentioned. So the business deferrals are in real good shape."

What I will tell you though, is that we have looked at it and factored it into our evaluation, the potential migration of those customers. But I am sure you appreciate the industry overall, as you guys have asked questions the other banks are the CERB plays out how the relief plays out and how we the industry deals with the migration back to business as usual, our key issues for us, but what I would say is, our \u2013 with our underwriting standards and the approaches of deferrals and reserves, we feel we have appropriately positioned for that migration and we do take that into account when evaluating the credit quality of our customers."

There is another cohort that \u2013 another cohort of mortgage borrowers where I have a little concern and that would be the group of people that have asked for a deferral. They have not lost their job, but they are earning significantly less than before. Think of small business owners, maybe some entrepreneurs and maybe just other that are simply trying to struggle through this but have not, lost their job and they were not on serve any idea how big cohort is within the deferral program?"

It\u2019s credit quality is sung with disciplined, underwriting, well, collateralized portfolio and no material exposure to sectors most impacted by COVID-19.
