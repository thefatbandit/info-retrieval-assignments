         "Thank you, Trisha, and good afternoon, everyone. Our timing for this quarter\u2019s earnings release and call is different than our normal practice, and we thank you for joining us late in the day. Today\u2019s economic environment is challenging and evolves daily sometimes hourly. In light of those challenges and volatility, we took significant steps in the second quarter to continue derisking our balance sheet.",
         "After building a solid reserve for credit losses in the first quarter and then issuing sub-debt in June, we made a strategic decision to opportunistically divest a large portion of our energy portfolio. Since 2014, we have communicated a goal of reducing our energy-related exposure. We went from a high of 13.4% of total loans to just under 4.5% as of March 31.",
         "Our plan to diminish the reliance upon and impact from this portion of our loan book was successfully working the book down to a less material level. In recent months, growing concerns due to an ongoing supply demand mismatch were exacerbated by the global pandemic, leading to a decision to accelerate reductions in exposure.",
         "We were pleased to reach an agreement with Oaktree Capital Management and sell over half the energy portfolio as of March 31, including the entire RBL book and a substantial majority of the larger relationships in midstream and energy services. Some, but not all, of the credits in the sale were in default.",
         "Our remaining energy concentration is a portfolio of mostly granular support service credits with an average outstanding balance of approximately $670,000. We have a healthy reserve in the remaining portfolio at 5.7% of energy loans and the transaction brings our energy portfolio sharply down to 1.7% of total loans, excluding PPP. Both non-performing loans and criticized loans declined significantly as shown on Slides 8 and 9 in the deck. And all, but two of the remaining loans are pass-rated credits.",
         "To complete the transaction, we booked a special provision of $160 million, or $1.47 per diluted share in the second quarter, in addition to releasing the existing reserve on those credits of $82 million. Additionally, based on updated economic forecast, during the second quarter, we built what we believe to be a stronger level of reserves for potential pandemic impact in our markets.",
         "So additive to the special provision for the loan sale, we booked a provision of $147 million, or $1.34 per diluted share. Our ACL to loans now stands at 2.3%, excluding PPP. On a positive note, loan payment deferrals applied at the onset of the pandemic began expiring in June.",
         "As noted on Slide 10, from a peak of $3.6 billion in outstandings in May, deferrals ended June at $2.7 billion and were further down to $1.4 billion as of July 15. We expect the trend to continue through mid-August all else equal.",
         "In an 8-K we filed in late June, we indicated an expectation of more than 50% of deferrals returning to normal payment upon maturity. Since that date through July 15, our expectations have been further refined such that we currently expect two-thirds to three quarters of our commercial customers to return to normal payment while we work with the remaining on either structured solution or second deferral.",
         "Stepping back from credit, the core businesses within our company improved linked quarter. Growth in loans and deposits both reflect the impact of PPP fundings. PPNR was up 2.4% linked quarter and we kept expenses under control despite the sizable cost and over time and other expense necessary to assist over 12,000 of our primarily small business clients with PPP loans.",
         "Looking forward, we remain committed to helping both our clients and associates manage through this pandemic event, and we believe we are making decisions in the best interest of our shareholders.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike Achary for a few additional comments and details.",
         "Thanks, Michael. Just open the call for questions."
      ],
      "Michael Achary": [
         "Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect a loss of $117 million, or $1.36 per share. They include, as John mentioned, $160 million special provision for the energy loan sale, as well as an additional $147 million provision related to updated COVID-19 forecast and modeling.",
         "Excluding the special provision for the loan sale at a 21% tax rate, earnings would have been $9.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. We\u2019re calling out the tax rate since our second quarter effective tax rate was 39%. Due to our year-to-date loss, tax credits and other tax-related items, we were able to report a profit after tax, excluding the sale. We do expect the effective tax rate to normalize in the back-half of the year at above 18%.",
         "Loans for the company increased $1.1 billion from March 31. This growth included $2.3 billion in PPP fundings, partly offset by the energy loan sale of $497 million and about $500 million in pay downs on lines of credit. As a reminder, we had a similar amount of line draws in the first quarter, as clients built liquidity in an abundance of caution associated with the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19.",
         "Deposits were up $2.3 billion, as PPP funding remain, for the most part, in customer DDA accounts. Also, the balance sheet was flushed with liquidity with almost $760 million at quarter-end and $17 billion in untapped sources of funding. Consistent with our intra-quarter comments, the margin declined 18 basis points linked quarter, mainly related to the Fed rate moves at the end of March.",
         "Slide 23 notes the headwinds and tailwinds and the waterfall chart notes the basis point impact per item. We believe the NIM will mostly stay in a range of a couple of basis points plus or minus from where we are now at least for the next couple of quarters, which is about as far out as we have decent visibility.",
         "John has already covered the loan sale and provision discussion points. But I would like to mention that for the quarter, we use Moody\u2019s June forecast for our macroeconomic assumptions. These are listed on Slide 18 in our earnings deck. We believe these scenarios present a reasonable mix of economic forecast and are appropriate for our ACL modeling purposes.",
         "Our fee income balances were down in most areas, either related to market dynamics or stimulus payments reducing overall fees. Secondary mortgage income is offsetting some of those declines in what\u2019s becoming a very favorable rate environment for mortgage banking with increased volumes.",
         "Noninterest expense was down $7 million linked quarter, reflecting equity write-offs of energy-related credits in the first quarter. The increase in personnel expense was mostly related to annual merit increases in April and overtime pay related to mortgage lending and PPP applications.",
         "Our capital remains solid and in excess of regulatory minimums, including buffers, as detailed on Slide 28. TCE did fall below 8% to 7.33% as of June 30. However, we expect to rebuild to levels closer to 8% by year-end. 36 basis points of the drop from last quarter was related to the loan sale with another 56 basis points due to the impact on TCE of the $2.3 billion in PPP funding.",
         "Finally, we do expect to pay our quarterly dividend, but are in consultation with our examiners. As always, the Board reviews our dividend policy quarterly.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to John."

Can you just give us some rationale as to why to sell now and maybe why didn\u2019t you hit the bid a couple of months ago as you were derisking the portfolio? And maybe what does energy lending look for Hancock Whitney going forward? Is it a business that you continue to plan to be in? Thanks."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks Michael. This is John. I\u2019ll start and Mike can add color or Chris can. If we look back in time, we\u2019ve been ratcheting the concentrations down really since 2014 and have had in the last couple of years a good bit of quarter-over-quarter improvement in the book. And then as we got toward the end of the year \u2013 this \u2013 the end of last year, supply/demand mismatch began to get worse.",
            "We all saw what happened as fears in the market took place around storage capacity and whatnot. And when looking in the future, the likelihood in a pandemic environment that demand was going to go up fast enough with the challenges that RBL \u2013 particularly companies in the RBL business had with raising equity just in the private market.",
            "The concern was that demand just wouldn\u2019t get up fast enough to cover some of those issues and we would see further deterioration of the book. And we had a buyer who was both sophisticated and had the capacity to purchase meaningfully all of the RBL midstream and a very large percentage of lumpy credits in the services side.",
            "So I think the degree and the quality of the partner that we had allowed us to do a transaction that was more conclusive than just small pieces at a time. And so, while certainly, we admit the discount appears steep, I think, time will tell whether it was a steep discount or whether it was a reasonable discount just over time.",
            "And so the benefit to us and the shareholders is the fact that the book is now derisked from an energy perspective and the residual book has a far lesser average loan size than what we sold. So I think the average outstanding on the book we sold was a little over $11 million and the residual amounts about $1 million per loan. So it\u2019s a \u2013 and that by the time you take out all the zero balance, it\u2019s about $1 million a loan.",
            "So in terms of going forward, Michael, the book that remains are primarily small to medium-sized businesses with a more diversified revenue stream and just simply the scale of the book being less and the client size being something that we believe is a lot less risky, from an investor point of view, is a business that, while I think the balance sheet will continue to diminish, the content of it is something we\u2019re a lot more comfortable with."

            "Hello, Michael, this is Mike. So the things I would add to John\u2019s comments probably first and foremost is on Friday, we announced that the agreement to sell the portfolio was executed. And then this afternoon, we actually were able to close the transaction. So all aspects of the transaction are really kind of behind us now.",
            "The other thing that I would add and I think this is obviously pretty important. But we look at all of these activities that we\u2019ve kind of undertaken in the first-half of this year as part of our overall derisking strategy, if you will. So we proactively built reserves pretty substantially in the first quarter. We added to that in the second quarter aside from the loan sale.",
            "So our ACL to loan stands at about 236 basis points right now. We raised some sub-debt during the second quarter and then took the opportunity, as John mentioned, to deploy some of that sub-debt, if you will, toward further derisking our balance sheet through the sale of a big part of the energy portfolio. So, again, we look at all of those activities really as kind of an overall derisking client."

We had a larger bank in Texas today note that regulators really have not given them any guidance around using the CCAR four quarter look-back in terms of dividend tests. I mean, where do you use that for you guys given two consecutive quarterly losses? It doesn\u2019t look good for the dividend, but there are \u2013 also are some countervailing forces. Maybe if you can just walk through how you guys think about ability to pay the dividend and then capital adequacy? Thanks."

But look, we\u2019ve been real transparent with our examiners through \u2013 so through really the entire process of looking at derisking our balance sheet through the reserve builds, as well as through the sale of the energy book.",
            "We\u2019ve kind of kept in constant contact with our examiners and they absolutely support the actions that we\u2019ve done. And as we said in the deck and on the script, we do intend to pay the third quarter dividend. But, of course, we\u2019re in consultation with our examiners, as well as our Board. So that process should be completed within the next 30 days or so and then we\u2019ll kind of go from there."

            "Hey, good afternoon, guys. If we could just touch on deferrals, I recognize that \u2013 appreciate that detail, but it peaked and now it\u2019s declined. Just curious what your outlook is on where this settles. In other words, there\u2019s probably some remaining first round deferrals that have not yet matured and I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re at in the process of having conversations with folks that may need a round two deferrals.",
            "So if I did my math right, I think, you \u2013 as of mid-July, you\u2019re roughly at a little over 6% of loans in deferral and where you think that might settle as you progress out over the next several weeks and get into more of a round two scenario?"

      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, sure. Yes, this is Chris Ziluca. As you pointed out, right now, we\u2019re settling out as at least 7.15% at around a little over 6%, closer to 7% right now in deferrals. That\u2019s come down pretty steadily since the peak.",
            "And as we also indicated earlier on in the conversation, we\u2019ve kind of refined our expectation around customers going back to normal payment to the two-thirds to three quarters\u2019 level, which basically indicates that the remaining portion is where we\u2019re focusing our attention, mostly around structured solutions to handle issues that may linger longer than just the regulatory guidance around less than 180 days. And to the extent that a customer feels that they\u2019re closer to resolving their operating challenges, then we would entertain a shorter second deferral to kind of bridge that gap.",
            "So, we have a pretty active dialogue on a weekly basis with our client-facing teams to ensure that we\u2019re executing on the plan more focused on structured solutions to the extent that anything additional goes beyond that timeframe. And we\u2019re feeling pretty confident in a lot of these conversations that we\u2019re having.",
            "Certainly, a lot of them are focused around the hospitality sector, including hotel and some of our full-service restaurant clientele in the New Orleans market. But overall, I think, we see some real positive dialogue going on between us and our clients to kind of bridge the divide here as it relates to the pandemic."

         "Remarks": [
            "Great. Thanks, Chris. Just one quick follow-up if \u2013 on the subject of derisking, are there any \u2013 other than obviously monitoring the loan book and deferrals for COVID-19, are there other derisking type of activities or moves that you guys are evaluating and you think you have at your disposal? And as a related point, are there any expense initiatives that you\u2019re considering that might be \u2013 that might fall into that line as well? Thanks."

      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. This is John. I\u2019ll start at the end and work my way back to credit. In terms of expense treatment, we\u2019ve had a good history of taking good views of rationalizing expenses in both good times and bad. Certainly, the environment that we\u2019re in now leads to volumes of various activities being somewhat diminished. Some of those are coming back like fee income and et cetera. Some may take a little longer.",
            "And so we\u2019ll be taking, I think, a very disciplined view of expenses around every category ranging from office space to facilities to non-people-related expenses. And also in terms of workforce, we are obviously hiring very few folks right now, and that\u2019s predominantly, because very few folks were trading.",
            "We have extremely good retention of team members at the moment, but we aren\u2019t hiring very many when vacancies appear. So I do think expenses will be a more favorable story as we go through the back of the year, but not ready to try to wrap any book-ins or round numbers as of yet.",
            "In terms of credit \u2013 and the first and second question, I couldn\u2019t tell if you meant around other books that we thought we were selling or not. If you did, I think, the answer to that is we have no other plans at the moment to do anything like that and aren\u2019t in any dialogue with anyone. But I mean, obviously, never say never, but that\u2019s not our intent. And then in terms of just credit in general, I mean, obviously, we\u2019ve tightened credit in certain sectors. And Chris, do you want to go into any specifics on that?"

      },
      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I mean, again, we\u2019re learning from a lot of the deferral activity and we\u2019re utilizing some of that experience to really tighten our underwriting guidance to the field and to our credit officers. And we have been focused for a while around making sure that the types of transactions that we\u2019re onboarding are less chunky and sizable in nature. And certainly, that sort of thought process continues.",
            "But overall, when we think about some of the sectors under focus that\u2019s in the earnings release, we are providing general guidance around just ensuring that existing accounts meet our criteria, as well as any new relationships that we might be considering with the idea that some of those sectors under focus are ones that we\u2019re going to be a little bit more selective and cautious about before we consider new opportunities."

         "Remarks": [
            "Kevin, this is John. The page that Chris is referring to is on Page 16 of the investor deck. And that\u2019s a little bit of a more enhanced slide than the one we had last quarter where we had whole sectors. And for that slide, we divided it between the subsectors and, in some cases, even within the subsector and broke those into tiers of concern.",
            "So you can somewhat see from that page that the total book of loans that we have under the most intense look right now is a bit smaller than maybe what we talked about a quarter ago. And then, I think, as we get toward the end of the year, instead of focused on sectors, we\u2019ll be talking about individual credits.",
            "And so I think over the course of the next quarter, as the deferrals are completely retired, as we know what the credits are that end up needing modest modifications versus additional restructuring, then we\u2019re going to see migrations based on actual risk ratings and not just sectors under focus. But Page 16 was intended to give a little bit more detail that was helpful, we thought, for investors to understand what part of the book could be at the most risk or less risk."

         "Remarks": [
            "And I will also just kind of add to that. I mean, the reality is, during the last earnings release, this was all fairly new. We were really focused on broad categories. And over the past quarter, we\u2019ve been able to kind of refine our understanding, such that in certain areas and in certain situations, we\u2019ve realized that maybe it\u2019s slightly less of a concern, and then in other areas, we still have the same level of concern and we\u2019re \u2013 have the same level of intensity around managing those transactions and books of business."

And we believe we\u2019ve done a significant amount of derisking and really look forward to kind of a return to more or less a normal level of provisioning in the second-half of the year.",
            "Now normal in this environment is kind of a wildcard. But as best we can tell, we should be able to return to kind of a more normalized level of provisioning, and that would also imply a level of profitability as well."

So that\u2019s another dozen to 15 basis points. So look, we \u2013 I think, we would be very disappointed if we\u2019re not back over 8% by year-end."

            "On service charge, it\u2019s \u2013 I wish there was a simple answer, but it kind of depends on which charges we\u2019re talking about. So if you look at the hit from 2Q to 1Q, it\u2019s a pretty big number of about $10 million pre-tax of that number depending on how you count it 40% to 60% of the overall $10 million in reduction was really the presence of stimulus.",
            "And by stimulus, I\u2019m talking about beneficial unemployment payments building PPP deposits into business accounts and just really what was early quarter of fear-driven hoarding of cash. And so NSF OD charges and regular deposit maintenance account charges were dramatically down.",
            "So that was about half, I\u2019m going to call it, 40% to 60% of the $10 million hit. Those will come back as deposit account balances normalize. Another $1 million \u2013 maybe $1.1 million or so were directly waived fees and those ended in July. And then, the remainder would be in transaction-related fees that were very much diminished just when the economy was largely shutdown. And so, those would be like annuity sales, loan fees that are not amortized, debit card volumes and et cetera.",
            "So both annuity and debit card balances have both. We\u2019re not at normalized levels yet, but they have resumed more so in July than June. Time will tell whether that sticks around for the whole quarter, but it looks maybe pretty good right now, particularly given the rate environment for annuities. And so, I think we\u2019ll start seeing some return on 3Q. It\u2019s very hard to project what the service and NSF OD charge income patterns will be, because it\u2019s tied to the excess balances in the deposit account.",
            "So without a place to deploy those funds, we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not getting the type of net interest income benefit you would get from that excess liquidity, right? So we\u2019re staying very liquid right now for that reason, because we do expect those deposit balances diminish as people begin to use the money.",
            "A totally different topic goes to secondary mortgage income where that revenue which we thought would ease up a little bit more in 2Q did not and it continued booming right through the second quarter and really through July so far has still remained stronger than we would have anticipated. How long that lasts? I don\u2019t know.",
            "But its rate-driven, and there is a somewhat attractive percentage of first-time homebuyers beginning to get into the market probably due to the attractiveness of rates. So we\u2019ll see how long that actually holds up. Does that help you or do you have any others you\u2019d like to \u2013 or any other\u2026?"

When you get to non-energy charge-offs, there were a small number of credits, some in the behavioral modification book, which is quite small. There was a fraud in a construction company and several of those were somewhat in play before the pandemic began, and there were some signs that we thought were pretty bright that they\u2019d be able to work through it and come back and actually do well. The pandemic took the wind out of that sale. And as a result, we opted to go ahead and proactively take those charges in 2Q.",

It was more \u2013 the inventory of credits that had some weaknesses that were maybe headed better that the pandemic eliminated, in our opinion, a chance of them actually recovering.

Just kind of curious kind of how it transpired and how it will impact your thoughts around provisioning going forward?",
            "I appreciate that it\u2019s very difficult to predict, but you guys note you do expect it to go lower. And then, also just curious, any color you could give us on kind of marks and E&P versus midstream versus service, as you kind of went through the process, kind of what you saw in terms of what the market kind of demanded there?"

            "Yes. This is John. I\u2019ll start and kind of tackle the first question. We\u2019ve made no secret of our desire. We want to take down energy concentration over a course of time and have successfully done that and the book really was improving. The \u2013 we were beginning to get towards the back of the year, and I think I may have mentioned that on a call at some point that we were getting onesie, twosie offers, some of those we took, most of them we didn\u2019t.",
            "On individual credits, the discounts were not terribly attractive, because generally, these were credits that were already distressed that, for whatever reason, a buyer was trying to accumulate debt for their own purposes. This transaction was the first opportunity to do something conclusive and a meaningful step towards a big derisking maneuver. And that really \u2013 because of that and because of the size of it, it unfortunately drove the discount to be higher than, I think, we\u2019d all like to see, but that was just our reality.",
            "So in terms of discounting between books, when these portfolios come together, generally, it just comes down to a number. I\u2019m sure there were individual numbers that were very different on the other side, but we\u2019re not privy to that and it would be improper for us to discuss it even if it were.",
            "So I think you just kind of look at the whole pool and look at \u2013 there were certainly credits in that book that we expected zero loss from. There were credits that might have had material loss in it. And so, by the time you roll them all together, you get a number we\u2019ve viewed as what our current expected losses may be if our darker scenarios came to fruition. And then the other opportunity to exit it all right now and redirect those resources, and the company\u2019s focus towards business we want to grow versus shrink, and that led to the decision. Anything else you want to add to that, Mike?"

And I mean, look, this is something certainly we\u2019ve thought about over time as we\u2019ve gone through the process of reducing our concentration pretty substantially over the past few years. And a number of factors, I think, came together in the second quarter that brought us to the conclusion to kind of initiate a process. And that\u2019s what we did.",
            "We had multiple individual firms that were involved in taking a look at the book. And in the end, we received multiple bids and it was fairly competitive. And we were pleased really with how the process played out. And as John indicated, typically, in a process like this, you\u2019re not going to get folks to differentiate \u2013 their pricing by credit or even by segment of the book. So, for the most part, it was really a portfolio sale, with portfolio level pricing. Hope that helps."

But suffice to say that, again, we\u2019ve really kind of completed the derisking that we thought was necessary in the first-half of the year, and we look for a return to a much more normalized level of provisioning, both in the third and the fourth quarter.",

The deferral percentages are \u2013 have obviously significantly reduced.

If that continues, then I think the future is maybe a little more brighter. If we end up with massive closures, then that would be a little bit more tough.

Why have we kept the remaining $350 million? I\u2019m just wondering given \u2013 it feels like you just wanted to remove the tail risk if oil went lower. So you kind of sold it at the best price you could get, so that you don\u2019t have to worry about this, the impact on stock is diminished. So why not sell the entire portfolio?"

When you get into credits that you have $300,000 balance or $500,000, there\u2019s just not a lot of appetite. So the \u2013 on the larger end, the few remaining large credits we have \u2013 and when you\u2019re fairly far down the road in a workout situation, it can become problematic to include one of those credits in a portfolio sale.",

And there was also a large number of accounts that have a zero balance right now. There\u2019s no real incentive for a buyer to buy zero balance at zero, right, and just take the remaining commitment. So that\u2019s the reason."

In terms of what\u2019s left, the average size of the relationship is only about $670,000, and it\u2019s well over 240 different relationships. So what we have left is extremely granular.

In fact, just this morning, we were \u2013 we\u2019re looking at the pipeline and it\u2019s still so full for refi that it\u2019s somewhat getting in the way of working with portfolio relationships that while they\u2019re not quick revenue, they\u2019re valuable. And so, our dialogue was do we need to peel off any resources to focus on the primarily profit banking portfolio that we expect to retain. And so the pipeline is still very full.",

I didn\u2019t expect there to be that much more refi business out there, but it just keeps on coming and so we\u2019re glad to take it.",

But as you begin to look forward if we\u2019re right or if we begin to see a darker scenario there, we could end up with problems in the midstream remaining book and so made the call to do a much more broader exit of energy in total.",
            "And the fact that those were syndications without core relationships meant it followed the pattern we\u2019ve been following in terms of managing more towards more granularity and more full-service relationships and so that\u2019s really why it was included. It was downside risk potential and the lack of offsetting liquidity."

If I exclude the PPP impact and the energy book loan sale, it looks like loan balances were still down sequentially, and you mentioned that previous line draws were paid down. So just curious where you think loan balances go from here. And if credit is tightening in certain segments that you mentioned before, should we assume the loan balances continue to contract from here ex-PPP?"

            "It\u2019s a good observation. And I think the headwinds do not appear or do appear stronger than the tailwinds in the very near-term. And forgive me for doing anecdotals on you, but I think they\u2019re applicable.",
            "First, in terms of just attrition from the portfolio, other than amortizations, we\u2019re seeing very, very little attrition in the book, i.e., customers that are out pricing existing debt. Clients appear to be more hunkered down. The downside to that, I mean, that\u2019s the upside that we see less runoff relative to prior quarters in the book, particularly the commercial book.",
            "The downside to it is the same things happening everywhere else. And so there\u2019s just not as much deal flow available. So it\u2019s hard to tell is that hunkering down in clients who are, for whatever reason, are out of \u2013 are unhappy where they are, but they\u2019re not willing to take the chance of moving to a new bank, or is it just straight-up light demand, because business sentiment is poor. It\u2019s hard to tell exactly why, but the bottom line is demand is very light.",
            "And so, as we look toward Q3, while we do have pipelines, they don\u2019t look that bad. In fact, the pipeline for the end of 2Q is the same as the pipeline for the end of 2Q last year, and that doesn\u2019t correlate with that demand scenario. But as we move through that pipeline, the credit risk appetite and sectors under focus begin to apply. And we \u2013 I think the pull-through rate is going to be much lower from \u2013 for the third Q pipeline than it was for third Q last year.",
            "I gave you a lot of information there, but there\u2019s a lot of anecdote information that points to less light attrition, but much lighter demand and with the secondary refinance activity causing diminishment to mortgage portfolio, coupled with the runoff of the indirect books, which we are not replacing, coupled with our appetite being a little tighter on the home equity line side. And at the upper end and certainly with syndications being more tight than \u2013 that would suggest to further shrinkage in the third quarter before we begin to see increases in loan balance sheet going forward.",
            "The only other wildcard I\u2019ll put in there is some of the PPP balances apparently went to paying down existing debt, because the recovery didn\u2019t happen as quickly as people thought. And so, with no expenses to use the PPP balances to burn, it just went to paying off other debt in the short-term. As the reopening occurred, we began to see some of that come back, but only recently.",
            "And so, it\u2019s really tough to give you \u2013 we\u2019re not going to give any guidance, because the guidance would be too much of a guess versus an informed decision. But I would just end it with saying the headwinds are outweighing the tailwinds for the near-term."

So, I guess, last quarter, you were 80% baseline and then 20% of the two severe scenarios. And then looks like now, you\u2019re at 50% baseline and then 25%, actually, a better scenario, and then 25% just a slower growth scenario. So it seems at least your baseline is more optimistic. Just any kind of commentary on your thought process there?"

            "And as you recall, as the first quarter was proceeding, the various Moody scenarios got kind of darker and darker as we went through that quarter. They also continue to get a little darker as we went through the second quarter. Although now that we\u2019re in the third quarter and have had a chance to look at the July scenarios, they seem to be stabilizing a bit.",
            "So the reasoning for why we changed the mix a little bit, I think, has everything to do with some of the comments John made earlier about our regional economies opening and probably, I think, on balance doing fairly well. There\u2019s also the prospect of additional stimulus out there over the next quarter or so. And so, that played into our thinking as well.",
            "But I think on balance, we really look at the two kind of together, and then we look at the result of how much we built our reserve and where we stand now and feel that we\u2019re in a pretty good place, all things considered."

The only thing I would add is, as we look across our footprint, there are pronounced differences in the degree of recovery already experienced market-to-market, and just using something as simple as hotel occupancy, average daily rate, revenue per available room, RevPAR, the relativity between markets is extremely different.",
            "And so we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a lot of questions around New Orleans, and the pressure in the city is primarily around the lack of convention and trade show business. But as you get to other markets, particularly the beachy markets, the beach-facing markets, in some cases, unbelievably, the numbers are only like 10%, 15% off of where they were a year ago. And so that also plays into the scenario differences, trying to throw a net around the whole footprint with both good and bad relative to baseline experiences."

            "\u2026if you look at where we peaked in the way of deferrals and where we report kind of the 7/15 million numbers, I think, Page 10 really kind of articulates that. We peaked at $3.6 billion. We\u2019re down to $1.4 billion. So the net obviously is kind of what\u2019s run off \u2013 the $2 billion that have kind of run off.",
            "I think we also indicated earlier that, we\u2019re seeing two-thirds to three quarters of our loans essentially going back to repayment. So you can assume from that, that the remaining amount are the ones that we\u2019re actively discussing or continuing to discuss second deferrals, but really more steering them towards a discussion around whether or not a second deferral is really sufficient, or whether or not a structured solution is probably the better way to go. And it\u2019s a mix of both of those.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t say that they\u2019re all going to go to a second deferral situation, some are just needing an additional month or two to kind of get them to what they feel and what we feel as a little bit more stabilized operating rhythm. But from there, then we start to explore risk ratings and the risk creating migration related there, too.",
            "And to the extent that the structures that we\u2019re talking about with our customers would indicate that we should be looking at potentially downgrading those credits, some of which may be just downgraded kind of within pass and some might be moving to watch or some sort of special mention substandard category. We\u2019ll probably see some migration in that regard.",
            "And I think we\u2019ve talked about this. We did certainly talk about it earlier last month in one of our investor presentations, where the reality is that the migration discussion is more of a second-half of 2020, as you start to really truly assess the longer-term impact of the pandemic on those individual credits and the structures that you might need to put in place to bridge that gap.",
            "We think it\u2019s all pretty manageable at this point in time based on the dialogue that I\u2019m having with our relationship managers and portfolio managers. But I do expect to see some migration on \u2013 in risk rating across the Board, across our risk rating spectrum in the second-half of the year."

When we filed the inter or the intra quarter 8-K back in late June, the guidance that we gave \u2013 it really wasn\u2019t guidance, it was just a statement of where we were. It looks like something a little better than 50% were going to return to normal payment and that was early.",
            "That number got up to where it looked more like two-thirds a few weeks later and now is two-thirds to 75%. So the trajectory of our expectations in return to normal payment has certainly gotten better over the course of time. That said, it\u2019s not done. And in August 10 is the last big tranche of deferral maturity.",
            "So we will have been through all of those additional 90-day deferrals by the second week of August. And then by the second week of September, we would have passed 30 days on all of the return to pay deferral dispositions. So when Chris says through the end of second-half is \u2013 there are prescriptive times where I think we\u2019ll have a lot more information around sort of what those themes turn out to be.",
            "So the purpose of giving all the details in Slides 10 through 16 was to provide the market as much detail as we have to support and explain the reason we\u2019re maybe a little bit more optimistic than we were a few weeks ago. Now, time will tell, right? We\u2019ve got a long way to go, I think, as an industry to know really what the pandemic impact is going to be, but those will be the broad themes that may be helpful for you."
