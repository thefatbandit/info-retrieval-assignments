         "Thank you, Jim. We are delighted with our continued strong performance and ability to serve our clients through these unprecedented times. During the second quarter, we closed a record number of loans, grew households 14% quarter-over-quarter annualized, modified approximately 3,600 loans for our clients impacted by COVID and delivered over 11,500 PPP loans to small business and non-profit clients.",
         "Importantly, we did this all without compromising our very high standards of service and safety. The resilience of our business model is derived from our unique service culture, as Jim described, and at the heart of that service culture are our people. Their care and dedication is now more valuable to our clients than ever.",
         "This time tested people first model is being reinforced and enhanced by our tech strategy. We are investing in agile platforms that enable rapid deployment of new features for our clients and process improvements to empower our colleagues.",
         "In light of our strategic vision, over the past few years we have upgraded our home loan origination system, consumer digital banking system and deposit client on-boarding system, while also building strong in-house development capabilities. These investments are being utilized with great effect to help meet the unique challenges of today.",
         "For example, since the pandemic began, we further digitized our deposit account opening process, rolled out additional mobile banking features, including the ability to connect our clients to their trusted advisors with one click and developed process automation tools to help our colleagues serve more PPP clients safely.",
         "These advancements resulted in a nearly 50% increase in digital deposit account openings in the last quarter alone. We saw a 200% increase in the adoption of the mobile check deposit feature, shifting significant branch activity online. We were able to close nearly as many PPP loans in one day as we do mortgages in a typical month.",
         "Our tech platform is reinforcing and scaling what is most important to our clients and fundamental to our business, the ingenuity and care of our colleagues. This in turn results in consistent sustainable performance even in challenging times such as these.",
         "With that in mind, let me turn to an update on lending. Loan origination volume in the second quarter excluding PPP was $11.4 billion, our best quarter ever. Single-family residential volume also set a new record at $5.9 billion for the quarter.",
         "Refinance accounted for 80% of this single-family residential volume. The majority of refinance activity came from clients previously at other institutions. We are pleased that home purchase finance activity increased quarter-over-quarter and particularly gained momentum in June.",
         "Multifamily and commercial real estate origination volume was $1.3 billion consistent with the first quarter.",
         "Turning to business banking, loans and line commitments excluding PPP were up 17% year-over-year. During the quarter, business line utilization decreased from 42% to 35%. This is once again consistent with our historical utilization range of mid-to-high 30%s.",
         "As we enter the second half of the year, our overall loan pipeline remains very strong, up meaningfully from this time last year. We continue to expect mid-teens loan growth for the full year 2020.",
         "In terms of credits, we continue to maintain our conservative underwriting standards. The average loan-to-value ratio for all real estate loans originated during the second quarter was just 55%. At quarter end, loan modifications totaled 4.3% of the entire portfolio. The new deferral requests have slowed quite substantially.",
         "In terms of fundings, it was a very good quarter. Total deposits were up 18% from a year ago. We continue to maintain a diversified deposit funding base. Checking deposits increased by $3.6 billion in the second quarter and now represents more than 62% of total deposits. Business deposits represent 55% of total deposits, in line with the prior quarter.",
         "Turning to wealth management, assets under management increased this quarter by 13% to $166 billion. The growth was due to market appreciation plus a net client inflow of $2.7 billion during the quarter. Also, since our last call, we welcomed two new wealth management teams to First Republic. Overall, it was a very strong second quarter and first half of 2020.",
         "Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer."
      ],
      "Jim Herbert": [
         "Thank you, Shannon. It was another strong quarter for First Republic Bank. Loan origination set a quarterly record. Deposits and wealth management assets also grew very nicely, and credit, capital and liquidity are all quite strong.",
         "This year\u2019s first half performance under very difficult conditions again demonstrates the consistency and sustainability of our conservative client-centric business model. Before I turn the details for the quarter, let me take a moment to discuss this business model.",
         "We founded First Republic Bank 35 years ago this month. Since then, First Republic has systematically and organically grown from a single office and less than 10 colleagues with $8.8 million in initial capital to over 80 offices over 5,000 colleagues, $128 billion in Bank assets, $156 billion in wealth management assets and a market capitalization of over $18 billion.",
         "During these years, we\u2019ve maintained the highest possible credit standards and we have been profitable each of the 35 years. Enterprise value has grown at over 24% per annum during this period. This strong 35-year performance has been sustained during widely varying economic conditions and through numerous unforeseen events, including the current pandemic.",
         "First Republic\u2019s steady organic growth is the direct result of staying focused on our core belief that we could build an unusually successful business by consistently providing a superior client service experience. This client service experience and excellence continues to be our driver. The accelerated application of technology to our already high touch service model is in fact further differentiating us. Gaye will discuss this a bit more in a moment.",
         "We\u2019ve also always believed in operating in a very safe and sound manner. We\u2019ve not strayed from our stringent loan underwriting standards nor our philosophy of maintaining ample capital and liquidity at all times. It\u2019s actually a very straightforward operating model, brought to life by our strong culture and by the extraordinary hard work and diligence of all of our colleagues.",
         "This culture of First Republic continues to be one of teamwork, entrepreneurship, innovation and accountability all of which empower each of our colleagues to be their very best every day on behalf of each other and our clients. The result is client satisfaction level measured by Net Promoter Score that continues to be twice the banking industry average. This is the source of our sustainability and growth.",
         "Let me turn to the second quarter strong result. Year-over-year total loans outstanding were up over 19%, not including PPP loans of about $2 billion. Total deposits grew more than 18% year-over-year and wealth management assets are up more than 13% year-over-year.",
         "This across the Board growth drove our financial performance. Total revenues grew 12% over the year, net interest income grew 17%, earnings per share had grown 13% year-over-year and tangible book value per share increased by 12% year-over-year.",
         "Credit remains quite strong, net charge-offs for the quarter were $1.1 million and non-performing assets at quarter end were only 13 basis points. Our Tier 1 leverage capital ratio at quarter end was 18.15. The full first half of 2020 has once again demonstrated the consistency and strength of First Republic simple, conservative, very client-centric business model.",
         "Let me turn the call over to Gaye Erkan, President.",
         "Thank you, Gaye and Mike. We are very pleased with the second quarter results, and I know I speak for Gaye and Mike and I when we say we\u2019re particularly proud of the tremendous effort and work of our colleagues throughout the first half of this year under very difficult conditions. Overall, the first half of the year has been very strong for 2020 and we believe we have good momentum going into the second half.",
         "Now we\u2019d be pleased to take your questions."
      ],
      "Mike Roffler": [
         "Thank you, Gaye. We are pleased with record net income of $257 million, up 15% year-over-year and record earnings per share of $1.40, up 13% year-over-year. Our provision for credit losses under CECL was $31 million in the second quarter. This included a provision for credit losses of $43.5 million related to our loan portfolio and held to maturity debt securities, which was offset by a reversal of the provision for unfunded loan commitments of $12.4 million.",
         "During the first half of 2020, we have added $91 million to our loan loss reserves, while net charge-offs were only $1.3 million. As Jim mentioned, our capital position remains strong. As of June 30, our tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.15%. this reflects two capital raises in the past nine months. In April, the Bank increased its quarterly cash dividend and we are pleased to maintain this dividend level.",
         "Our liquidity position also remained strong. HQLA was 13.4% of total average assets in the second quarter. In May, we completed a residential mortgage backed securitization, our first in many years. Loan sales have always been an important part of our business and this securitization provides yet another source of funding and liquidity. We always retain the servicing of our loans sold. Very importantly net interest income increased 16.8% year-over-year. This reflects the power of our consistent growth of earning assets.",
         "Our net interest margin for the second quarter was relatively stable at 2.7% despite interest rate volatility. We are particularly pleased the margin was down only 4 basis points compared to last quarter.",
         "During the quarter, we reduce the overall rate paid on deposits to just 30 basis points. This decline helped bring our overall funding costs down 22 basis points from the first quarter, which largely offset the 24-basis-point decline in earning asset yields. We continue to expect our net interest margin to be in the range of 2.65% to 2.75% for the full year 2020.",
         "Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 62%. The efficiency ratio has benefited from reduced expenses for marketing, travel and events as a result of the pandemic. Given the first half performance, we now expect our efficiency ratio for the full year 2020 to be in the range of 62.5% to 64.5%. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 19.4%. We continue to expect our tax rate for the full year 2020 to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Overall, it was a very good quarter.",
         "Thank you. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jim."

         "Remarks": [
            "I want to start on -- hi, Jim. I want to start on credit. So if you look at the loan modifications of around $4 billion. Jim, I know this is a tough question at this stage, but what\u2019s your assessment in terms of what portion of those could become problem credits?"

         "Remarks": [
            "It is a tough question, Steve. We don\u2019t of course really know, but we have, as you might imagine, scrub them considerably, and probably, more importantly, we know our clients very well. We know the situation very well.",
            "Suffice it to say that the vast majority of those modifications have quite reasonable loan-to-value ratios in the 50s and so we don\u2019t expect to be very much at risk ultimately on losses. We will have some anecdotal situations but it\u2019s our opinion we don\u2019t have a systemic issue at this point."

      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then similar if a change in direction a little bit, if we look at the $2.4 billion of the COVID impact to loans that you\u2019re calling out and you -- I assume you\u2019ve scrubbed that too. Jim, when you look at the collateral there, how do you think about lost content in that bucket?"

         "Speaker": "Steven Alexopoulos"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Again, reasonably low because the lost content for instance in the hospitality area, the loan-to-value ratios are below 50% and we have guarantees on a significant portion of them. And so, as a result, we think we\u2019re probably okay, but we may have some work through for sure and we\u2019ll have some losses, but it will be mostly a work through problem. And what we don\u2019t know, of course, is who will begin payments post the deferral period but we\u2019re actually pretty optimistic."

         "Remarks": [

         "Remarks": [

         "Remarks": [

And then final one from me, so if you look at the $5.9 billion of single-family originations in the quarter, just doing my math given the color Gaye provided, it looks like purchases were $1.2 billion this quarter, so I guess down a little bit year-over-year. Can you give color on the purchase market and is the spring selling season delayed just given everything virtual or is it not going to be what we\u2019ve seen in the past? Thanks."

            "Yeah. Steve, correct. We are seeing that the spring buying season is delayed into the third quarter if not beyond. But we are optimistic, first of all, on the refinance, if I can comment. Over half of the refinance activity is with clients from other institutions. So it\u2019s a great opportunity, great win for us.",
            "And on the purchase side especially on the West Coast, the purchase activity has picked up nicely and great momentum. June is especially particularly strong. And we are also seeing there\u2019s suburb purchase activity in New York suburbs to be quite active as well."

It does and I would just comment that the forgiveness of the loans under PPP is likely not a late fourth quarter, more next year event, because of the changes made to extend to a 24-week cover period and then the borrowers actually have some time to apply. They don\u2019t have to run in and do it right away. So we think it\u2019s probably more next year than it is this year frankly."

But does that move back to more of -- a more normalized level, say, once -- where is the normalized level, I guess once the pandemic is over, because I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re going to travel a little bit more and do more marketing, et cetera?"

So it\u2019s really this year is the one we\u2019d focus on.

And buried in that and unstated is the clients have also taken to a number of those approaches. So there may come out of this some efficiency gains, but we\u2019re not sure and we certainly don\u2019t want to project them yet."

And in terms of our colleagues and I was working -- as much as we\u2019re looking forward to back in the office it\u2019s when it\u2019s safe. We have been incredibly effective working remotely in this quarter and the past quarter proved that, so we don\u2019t need to rush back in."

To your reserve calculation this quarter, what were some of the bigger economic assumptions that went into that, I know real estate prices bear sort of heavier weight in your analysis.

So and I\u2019d say this, our projections from 90 days ago probably were conservative and that prices have actually held up really well and in most markets are actually continuing to increase slightly.",

            "So, I think, multifamily actually has held up pretty well. And CRE, that\u2019s why we underwrite to stress scenarios with low LTVs and strong cash flow coverages. Does it change demand for office? I do think some of that is going to be determined in the future."

There probably is another downtick to our deposit rates. We ended the quarter in sort of the mid-20s range on a spot basis, so there should be a little benefit there, which hopefully offsets some of the continued drift that you\u2019ll see in loan yields."

But the private equity continues to be an attractive investment opportunity for limited partners given the lower rate and rich equity environment in the public markets. And there is around $1.5 trillion amount of dry powder in the market.",

They are currently at 36%. And as we mentioned in the prior quarter, utilizations were elevated in the first quarter as the GPs were spacing out capital calls and they returned back to the historical range we have seen mid-to-high 30s.

We\u2019re all reading about everyone leaving New York City and San Francisco, and departing for the suburbs and you guys are obviously in a unique perspective given your urban market concentration. Just how do you -- what are you -- given your experience and based on what you\u2019re seeing from your client base, what do you -- how do you see this playing out? Is this more long-term or is this somewhat temporary?"

            "We need to remember, it\u2019s -- to some extent it\u2019s a reversal of a trend that have been going on for 10 years or 15 years where the people have been coming out of the suburbs and going into the cities. So we may have simply a pendulum coming back a bit to the center.",
            "But the number of units of housing in the suburbs versus in the cities is going to be the driving factor. There\u2019s only so many homes in South Hampton and Greenwich versus Manhattan. And so I think it\u2019s an adjustment. I don\u2019t think it -- and I think it\u2019s a directional change for sure. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to -- it\u2019s not going to -- the implication, of course, is it leaves the city centers hollowed out. That\u2019s not going to happen.

So it won\u2019t be a 1 for 1 percentage increase, maybe it\u2019s half maybe it\u2019s 60% of an increase to the rate, because those benefits are all greater in a higher tax rate."

Equity evaluations in the public market rebound. Equity evaluations are rich. So there is -- especially from institutional PE.

There could be a little bit of call it we\u2019re in taxes right now, so there could be a little bit of extra cash early this quarter that comes down that could cause some margin to bounce around a little bit, but we feel pretty good right sort of where we are."

And then just a quick one on the efficiency ratio guide, maybe core efficiency ratio at the core very good this quarter and first half really and understand the compensation accruals and the business mix can bounce around wealth management. But you\u2019re looking comfortable be able to come in below that mid-60%s range. Is there anything lumpier on the expense side on the back half of the year that we should be thinking about?"

            "And the other I\u2019d say is this, if you ran the margin up to 2.65% to 2.75%, that equates to about a 2% difference in your efficiency ratio. So they\u2019re actually pretty much in line with 2% together now."

A part of the -- a majority part of the deposit growth is coming from clients doing more with us and aggregating their accounts with us. And we enabled them and empowered them to open their accounts online if they choose to do so.",
            "We also have senior hours in our box strategies in the PDOs in our branches if they choose to come in. But at the end are doing -- not losing our clients, doing more of it and being responsive to them and the referrals that are coming in from the clients, whether it\u2019s digital or PDO, they are the same robust trusted relationships that are coming because of the service our colleagues provide. So we feel comfortable with this stickiness and stability regardless of the channel. It\u2019s just more of an empowerment of our colleagues and clients."
