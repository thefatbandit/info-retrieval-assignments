         "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Choice Properties Q2 2020 conference call. I\u2019m joined here this morning by Rael Diamond, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mario Barrafato, Chief Financial Officer and Ana Radic, Executive Vice President, Leasing and Operations.",
         "Before we begin today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to remind you that by discussing our financial and operating performance, and in responding to your questions, we may make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Choice Properties\u2019 objectives, strategies to achieve those objectives, as well as statements with respect to management\u2019s beliefs, plans, estimates, intentions, outlook and similar statements concerning anticipated future events, results, circumstances, performance or exceptions that are not historical facts.",
         "These statements are based on our current estimates and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the conclusions in these forward-looking statements.",
         "Additional information on the material risks that can impact our financial results from estimates and assumptions that we made in applying and making these statements can be found in the recently filed Q2 2020 Financial Statements and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis, which are available on our website and on SEDAR.",
         "I will now turn the call over Rael."
      ],
      "Mario Barrafato": [
         "Thank you, Rael. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin with a brief overview of our financial results, and then I\u2019ll speak to our balance sheet activity. Our reported funds from operations for the second quarter was $140.6 million or $0.201 per unit diluted. This compares to $170.2 million or $0.248 per unit diluted in the second quarter of 2019.",
         "The declines to FFO for the current period were primarily due to three risk mitigation measures, which resulted in one-time charges to FFO of $29.2 million or $0.04 per unit. The first mitigation measure was the May issuance of $500 million of unsecured debentures with a seven-year term at an interest rate of 2.84%.",
         "The offering received strong investor demand, allowing us to upsize the deal from $350 million to 500 million and issued the debt at the second lowest REIT coupon to-date for seven-year bonds. Proceeds from the issuance was used to repay our credit facility and early redeemed $350 million of debentures maturing in Q1 2021. The early redemptions of the 2021 bonds resulted in fees, totaling $6.8 million, which IFRS requires to be fully expensed in the period, rather than amortize over the term of the newly issued debt.",
         "The second measure was supporting our tenants who\u2019ve been negatively impacted by the pandemic, through rent deferrals and participating in the CECRA program. And notwithstanding the ongoing support being provided, we recognized that there are costs and increased collectability risk for certain tenants for these amounts past due. Well, we haven\u2019t experienced any significant tenant defaults to-date, we have estimated a potential cost to the bad debts, including the potential CECRA abatements to be $14.6 million for the quarter.",
         "And the final measure was protecting our investment in a mortgage receivable by placing a stalking horse bid for the underlying asset, which is currently in receivership, and for accounting purposes, the carrying value of the mortgage receivable had been revised to this bid, which resulted in a $7.8 million credit loss during the quarter.",
         "Excluding the previously noted bad debt expense, our operating performance was stable. Quarter end occupancy remained strong at 96.8% with retail occupancy at 97.7%, industrial occupancy at 94.9% and office occupancy at 92.6%. We did have negative absorption in the quarter of 516,000 square feet, but primarily related to our Ontario industrial portfolio, of which, 360,000 square feet has already been leased and with strong prospects for the remaining space.",
         "This translates into same asset cash NOI, excluding bad debts of 1.1% year-over-year. This growth reflects the annual step rents embedded within the Loblaw portion of our portfolio as well as incremental cash generated from leasing activity over the last 12 months.",
         "In consideration of COVID-19, we have adjusted our property valuations. Leasing assumptions in the retail portfolio have been updated, reflecting increased downtime, potential vacancy, rental rate adjustments and increased leasing costs at certain properties. This resulted in the reporting of the Q2 fair value loss of $231 million.",
         "In keeping with COVID, our top financial priority is to mitigate financing risk and maintain a strong liquidity position. Over the course of the year, we\u2019ve significantly improved our balance sheet by extending our weighted average term of debt and lowering our weighted average interest rate cost.",
         "By redeeming two of our debentures maturing in early 2021, it leaves us with no significant debt maturities until September of \u201921, reducing our risk profile and providing us with flexibility, and by repaying amounts drawn on our $1.5 billion credit facility, it gives us ample liquidity in addition to approximately $12 billion of unencumbered assets that we can finance or prune to raise capital.",
         "We\u2019ve also focused on capital preservation and maximizing the amounts available to be drawn on our credit facilities. With that in mind, we\u2019re monitoring our capital expenditures and where we contemplated using our credit facility, we\u2019re looking at alternate sources of financing. So overall, with our low debt level, our high liquidity level and our investment grade credit rating, we believe we are well positioned to manage the current challenging environment.",
         "I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Rael."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Choice Properties Real Estate Investment Trust\u2019s Q2 Earnings Announcement Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]",
         "I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Doris Baughan, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. Thank you, please go ahead."
      ],
      "Rael Diamond": [
         "Thank you, Doris and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join our Q2 conference call. Let me start by acknowledging, the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to take thoughtful actions to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on our day-to-day business operations, while focusing on the best interests of employees, tenants and other stakeholders. We\u2019re encouraged by some initial signs of things returning to normal.",
         "Every day, more businesses reopen, and people find new ways to go about their daily lives. And while we\u2019re still early, and the full impact of the pandemic cannot be fully predicted, we remain confident that our business model and disciplined approach to financial management will allow us to weather the storm.",
         "As I mentioned last quarter, the pandemic has had the most notable impact on our retail assets, and certain tenants were either forced to close or to operate in a reduced capacity. That said, at Choice, we\u2019re in an enviable position given the makeup of our portfolio. Our retail assets are primarily leased to the grocery stores, pharmacies or other necessity-based tenants with stable business operations. We are confident that the high-quality nature of our retail properties and the strength of our anchor tenants who helped mitigate the effect of the pandemic.",
         "Beyond retail, we also earn high quality industrial, office, residential properties in Canada\u2019s largest markets. This diversification enables us to further reduce risk and stabilize cash flows. As one of Canada\u2019s largest landlords, we have an important role to play in helping Canadians and their businesses during these unprecedented times.",
         "In March, we agreed to assist qualifying small businesses and independent tenants with rent deferrals for 60 days. We have further supported our tenant by participating in the CECRA program, the Federal relief program, which were \u2013 which provides a 75% rent abatement for qualifying small businesses for four months commencing April 1, 2020. Of which, one-third is funded by landlords and two-thirds by the Federal government.",
         "In addition to helping our small tenants, we\u2019ve received numerous requests from our larger tenants, whose businesses have been adversely impacted by the pandemic. We\u2019re dealing with our largest tenants on a case-by-case basis to assist them with a path forward. And there are instances in which we have abated rents in exchange for improved lease terms.",
         "Rent collection for the second quarter was approximately 89%, a strong number, reflecting the resilience of our necessity-based portfolio. July rents have now come due. And as of yesterday, we received approximately 94% of the contractual rents for the month. This is an encouraging sign, as our rent collections are steadily increasing each month, as more tenants are getting back to business.",
         "Before Mario discusses our financial result and the strength of our balance sheet, I want to spend a moment discussing transaction activities. While the market for transaction activities has slowed considerably as a result of the pandemic, we did execute on two strategic acquisitions. We acquired a small parcel of land at Bloor & Dundas for approximately $8 million. This asset represents a key component on the land assembly at Bloor & Dundas.",
         "We also acquired a six and a half acre, vacant parcel of land from Loblaw for approximately $8 million. The property is just south of the intersection of Warden and St. Clair in Toronto and is in close proximity of the Warden Subway Station. We\u2019re working through a potential rezoning of the site for future residential density and hope to have more to report on those later.",
         "Subsequent to the quarter end, we entered into an agreement with our partner, Woodbourne, a residential development site at 190, Richmond Road in Ottawa. The development envisions a mid-rise rental residential building, comprising 250 units in the trendy neighborhood of Westboro, located west of downtown Ottawa, and in close proximity to our future LRT station.",
         "Woodbourne is an existing partner on three other sites with Choice, the transaction with Woodbourne will be secured \u2013 will be structured as a 50:50 venture with a 99-year ground lease. The ground lease structure allows Choice to retain a 100% ownership interest in the land and is consistent with the lease objective of generating long-term, stable and growing income streams. This development represents an opportunity for Choice to unlock value through the intensification of an existing income-producing assets, construction is expected to start later this year or early in 2021.",
         "As it relates to our mezzanine lending program, we continue to work through the receivership process on our mortgage receivable assets in Barrie, Ontario. The loan is secured by a property that is adjacent to a grocery-anchored shopping center owned by Choice and further cross collateralized by two other properties, where Choice is a joint venture partner with the borrower.",
         "In July, the Trust submitted an unconditional stalking horse bid to the receiver to acquire the property at a price that is approximately $8 million less than the amount of the loan. It is possible that the Trust\u2019s offer will be accepted by the court and ownership of the property will be transferred by the court to the Trust. Mario will provide more details on the accounting treatment in a moment.",
         "On the development fronts, our development continues to progress well. There have been some temporary delays due to work stoppages, labor shortages and the implementation of social distancing measures on site. But for the most part, construction is back up and running and the overall impact on a development program has been minor.",
         "In the quarter, we completed and transferred two development properties for approximately 22,000 square feet of GLA at our share. This includes a new Loblaws located at our Erin Ridge development in Alberta. Our two largest ongoing projects are the residential developments at 39 East Liberty and 390 Dufferin, both in downtown Toronto.",
         "These projects are on the vertical construction and have not experienced any significant delays as a result of the pandemic. We anticipate completing construction at 390 Dufferin in Q4 of this year, and 39 \u2013 East Liberty in Q3 of 2021, with a projected lease up period of approximately one year for both assets following completion.",
         "I would now like to pass the call over to Mario to provide an update on our financial performance for the quarter.",
         "Thank you, Mario. Before we open it up to questions, I would like to reiterate why we continue to believe that we\u2019ll emerge from this crisis in a better position than most. First, our team. I\u2019m incredibly proud of our teams\u2019 response today. They have adapted and remain connected going above and beyond for the fellow coworker and for our tenants.",
         "Next, our portfolio, we are in a high-quality real estate portfolio and of a development program that provide opportunities to add high quality stable real estate assets over the coming years. Finally, our balance sheet, with a strong balance sheet with $1.5 billion of liquidity that provides the flexibility necessary to help insulate Choice Properties in the face of broader market volatility.",
         "We are confident that the strategic and operating decision that we have made across our business positions us to withstand this pandemic and assist our tenants where we can. Our top priority remains ensuring the health and well-being of our employees and tenants and we\u2019re working diligently to ensure that Choice Properties is running as smoothly and effectively as possible.",
         "Operator, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Thank you."

So we decided just to go a little deeper and we just looked at more macro directional assumptions in terms of vacancy and in rental rates and downtime, so, yes, nothing objective, just our view of updating the models and reporting back to our board directionally on the environment as we see it today."

But again, with lack of transactions right now that right now, we\u2019re just getting kind of everything status quo.",

And the prospect they \u2013 I mean particularly in Toronto and the price that they\u2019re willing to buy properties that on a per square foot basis you know, would be to find access, where we would be carrying the assets on our balance sheet at. So you know a few of those transactions start to happen. You know, we may be able to take some write-off then but as we say, there definitely some activity on you know from a small \u2013 from a user perspective."

         "Remarks": [
            "So Sam, you know, and I can give a little more color as well, but the way we did it is essentially we shifted our focus to the CECRA program. So, the governments had shortly announced that they were looking at a program. So many of those tenants that qualified for those deferral agreements, then started seeing if they were able to qualify for the CECRA program. And so, you know, we would expect it to not be materially different than it was last quarter. I don\u2019t know Ana if you want to add anything?"

And some of our regional tenants with multiple locations, we have done a few deferral agreements with those, but really it hasn\u2019t materially changed the amount of deferral rent."

            "We do believe the bulk of you know, the provisions are behind us, there will be some provisions for obviously, one month of CECRA in July. And then, you know if there are any, you know, any potential defaults from tenants, but right now, you know, we do believe the bulk is behind us and we do expect things to continue improving."

            "the CECRA program, but we\u2019ve made assumptions which tenants will qualify. It\u2019s a very, very labor-intensive program. You know, we have fall roughly and Ana can correct me, roughly 200 applications so far, but it\u2019s a very labor-intensive program. You need information back from the tenants and, you know, it\u2019s taking a lot of time. So we\u2019ve made an estimate for tenants that will qualify and we\u2019ve taken a provision on, based on our best estimate, Pammi. I don\u2019t know Ana, if you want to add anything?"

And so right now, I mean, the \u2013 we\u2019re using whatever capital we can into our development program, and it slowed down a little bit, but it\u2019ll get back ramped up.",

But the quantum, there\u2019s no objective data that was supported. So we thought initially in Q1, we knew that there would be more risk in the environment compared to the quarter before and hence that justified a move into the discount rate.",

And so all we did this quarter was extrapolate assumptions across the entire portfolio. It was, again, no one single assumption dominating or ruling but just applying again, directionally a trend that we\u2019re seeing in all of these real estate fundamentals across the portfolio."

And if anything, I mean, the grocery stores or people want to be in those sites on the cash flows with the investment grade tenancies, the value could go the other way that could become more valuable.",

Of that 120,000 feet on Lawrence Avenue we\u2019ve re-leased about or leased about 60,000 feet and, you know, rents that exceed our pro forma.",

So, you know, obviously, we\u2019re seeing, you know real rental growth in industrial and particularly in Ontario.
