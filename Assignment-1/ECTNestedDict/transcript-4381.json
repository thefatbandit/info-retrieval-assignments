         "Good day, and welcome to the American Woodmark Corporation First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded, August 25, 2020.",

         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to American Woodmark\u2019s first fiscal quarter conference call. Thank you for taking the time to participate. Joining me today is Scott Culbreth, President and CEO. Scott will begin with a review of the quarter, and I will add additional details regarding our financial performance. After our comments, we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions. Scott?",
         "Thank you, Scott. The financial headlines for the quarter. Net sales were $390 million, representing a decrease of 8.7% over the same period last year. Adjusted net income was $28.2 million, or $1.66 per diluted share in the current fiscal year versus $36.1 million, or $2.13 per diluted share last year.",
         "Adjusted net income was negatively impacted by lower sales due to COVID-19, deleveraging of our fixed costs and a decline in efficiency. Additionally, we incurred restructuring charges related to the closure of our Humboldt manufacturing facility for $1.8 million and corporate actions for $1.7 million. These were partially offset by unrealized gain on a foreign exchange forward contracts of $1.3 million.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA was $57 million, or 14.6% of net sales compared to $69.6 million, or 16.3% of net sales for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. The new construction market remains strong during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, recognizing a 60 to 90-day lag between start and cabinet installation. The overall market activity in single-family homes was down 9.4% for the financial first quarter.",
         "New construction net sales decreased 4.8% for the quarter. Timberlake direct business comped positively and was offset by price and mix and negative comps in our frameless business. The remodel business felt the impacts of states limiting access to people\u2019s homes to install cabinets versus our new construction business, which was deemed essential.",
         "The combined home center and independent dealer/distributor channel, net sales decreased 11.4% for the quarter, with home centers decreasing 12.5% and dealer/distributor decreasing 7.6%.",
         "The company\u2019s gross profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 was 20.5% of net sales versus 22.1% reported in the same quarter of last year. Gross margins in the first quarter of the current fiscal year was negatively impacted by lower sales volumes due to COVID-19, deleveraging of our fixed costs and a decline in efficiency. One of our focus elements is keeping our employees safe during these unprecedented times.",
         "Total operating expenses were 12.8% of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with 11.7% of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2020. Selling and marketing expenses were 5.1% of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with 4.8% of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2020. The ratio increased as a result of higher display and incentive costs, combined with deleverage from lower sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.",
         "General and administrative expenses were 7.7% of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with 6.9% of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2020. The increase in the ratio was primarily driven by the deleverage from lower sales, higher incentive costs and severance that was not part of restructuring.",
         "Free cash flow totaled $32.2 million for the current fiscal year compared to $56 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to changes in our operating cash flows, specifically lower net income and cash outflows from customer receivables and inventories.",
         "Net leverage was 2.1 times adjusted EBITDA at the end of our first fiscal quarter, as a result of our increasing cash balance and stable debt position. The company chose not to pay down any of its term loan facility during this quarter. As a reminder, there are no term loan debt maturities due until December 2022.",
         "Echoing what Scott said earlier, we are continuing to make an investment back into the company around product, technology and labor to help balance the macroeconomic impacts from COVID-19 and to position the company for future growth.",
         "Starting with our workforce. We continue to invest in our workforce to drive long-term employment satisfaction and meet our customer needs. Focusing on technology, the company will start the journey to standardize the finance and procurement processes and systems to help drive further improvements and efficiencies.",
         "Lastly, related to our products. Investments will be made to refresh our current product lines. Concurrently, we will be removing targeted products that no longer fit the current market trends. Due to the impacts of COVID-19 and the evolving macroeconomic uncertainty in the current remodeling and homebuilding environment, we are unable to provide a full fiscal year 2021 outlook.",
         "Shifting our focus onto the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect low to mid single-digit net sales growth versus the prior year. This growth rate is very dependent upon overall industry, economic growth trends and consumer behaviors. Margins will be challenged with increases in labor and product launch costs.",
         "We expect adjusted EBITDA margins for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 to decrease versus prior year results and be less impacted than our first quarter of the fiscal 2021 EBITDA drop in comparison to the prior year.",
         "The company has taken actions to improve its cash position. And as of July 31, 2020, we had $128.1 million of cash on hand and access to $93.6 million of additional availability under its involver. Liquidity and margin management are priorities for our teams.",
         "In closing, I want to thank all the employees that make it happen everyday, while maintaining a safe work environment during these unprecedented times. I\u2019m amazed at what the team has been able to accomplish during the increasing demands and challenges that the business faces daily. I look forward to continuing to execute the company\u2019s 2025 vision and strategy.",
         "This concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you have at this time."

      "Scott Culbreth": [
         "Thank you, Paul, and thanks to everyone for joining us today for our first fiscal quarter earnings call. My hope would be that you and all of your loved ones have remained safe during these unprecedented times. Our team did an exceptional job of delivering results in the quarter that were ahead of our expectations.",
         "Before I get into the details of our performance, I want to first thank our extraordinary group of employees that have allowed American Woodmark to operate through this period as an essential supplier. Thank you all for making it happen.",
         "As a reminder, during the month of April, we experienced a two-week disruption in our Mexico operations. This ultimately led to disruptions in our stock kitchen and bath supply chains, and we continue to focus on recovering those segments in our business.",
         "Our first quarter sales were down 8.7%, which was significantly better than what we imagined at the start of the quarter and in alignment with our revised outlook issued in the company\u2019s 10-K. Within new construction, our business declined 4.8% versus prior year.",
         "Our Timberlake direct business comped very positive, while our frameless PCS business continued to comp negatively. Most of our national builders are optimistic for the remainder of the calendar year due to their most recent month sales activities, and they have projected for this to continue in both starts and completions for the remainder of fiscal year 2021.",
         "Builders have also expressed concern about the capacity of the manufacturing trade base to keep up with demand for the balance of the year, which can impact their build rates.",
         "Looking at our remodel business, which includes our home center and independent dealer and distributor businesses, revenue was down 11.4% in the prior year. Within this, our home center business was down 12.5%. Our made-to-order remodel platform has been most impacted by the pandemic and was down over 20%.",
         "Our stock business was down low single digits. We focused on recovering the two weeks of lost production due to our Mexico closures and were challenged with labor recruiting retention. Our frameless offering continue to grow high single digits. Our incoming order rates for the MTO platform did improve throughout the quarter, which should yield a better fiscal second quarter.",
         "With regards to our dealer/distributor business, we were down 7.6% for the quarter. As with home centers, consumer demand has improved with dealers and distributors reporting elevated consumer and builder interest.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA margins were 14.6% for the quarter, with EPS of $0.97 and adjusted EPS of $1.66. The overall market uncertainly continues to impact our balance sheet and we remain focused on capital preservation. Our cash balance increased from $97.1 million to $128.1 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter, and the company has access to an additional $93.6 million under its revolving credit facility.",
         "We made no debt payments in the quarter and maintained net leverage of 2.1 times adjusted EBITDA. I believe the company is well positioned to take advantage of the favorable housing environment. Customers are spending more time at home. Consumers have additional discretionary fund to spend at home and existing home sales and single-family starts are improving.",
         "Going forward, our focus will be to take advantage of these trends, while also managing our cash and expenses to match demand levels. We must permanently improve efficiencies across our footprint, while investing wisely in the future. Investments will make \u2013 will be made in product, technology and labor.",
         "Our marketing team has some exciting product launches scheduled this year, along with needed discontinuances that will allow us to refresh and simplify our lines. Technology investments we\u2019ve made in the finance and procurement functions allowing us to operate as one company and become more efficient.",
         "Investments in labor, such as wages, retention and absenteeism programs will be needed to meet our customers\u2019 needs. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s one single issue impacting our efforts, it is a number of factors, the CARES Act, heat, masks, schooling decisions for families, et cetera. Some programs will be short-term in nature with others long-term, but there will be an impact on fiscal Q2 margins for these investments.",
         "We will also be expanding our warehousing capabilities in Texas to allow for additional stock production. Demand remains strong in this category and additional warehouse will allow us to better manage overall staffing levels across the platform.",
         "Finally, before closing, I wanted to address a common question I\u2019ve received over the past six weeks from employees, customers and shareholders, is the vision and strategy changing from American Woodmark? Management has been clear that our 2025 vision has been set, along with our strategy and our focus is now on execution.",
         "The tactics that will allow us to achieve the vision may change, and that would be true regardless of the leader of the organization. Culture, connection and focus have been key themes I\u2019ve emphasized with our teams, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019re making progress.",
         "I will now turn the call back over to Paul for additional details on the financial results for the quarter."

            "Oh, hi, thank you. Just first off, can you provide a little bit more color and perhaps quantify some of the investments around labor, technology and products that you called out? I\u2019m just wondering is the cost headwind that you anticipate into the second quarter, is that going to be limited to 2Q? Or is there expected to be some follow through through the balance of the fiscal year?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So a couple of comments on maybe the long-term nature of things first, and then we\u2019ll step back and talk about Q2. So specifically around product launches, our product launch windows tend to be in our fiscal Q2, Q3 period. So we\u2019ll see some launch activity in both of those periods.",
            "With respect to the wages, as in my remarks \u2013 opening remarks addressed, there\u2019ll be an aspect of that, that I think will be more one-time in nature, specifically around some retention programs in the quarter. But element to overall wage increases and absentee \u2013 absenteeism programs, I think, is something that could continue as we go forward.",
            "We\u2019ll get the warehouse up and running towards the end of the quarter. But we believe we\u2019ve got incremental revenue to be able to offset and mitigate the costs associated with that. So you got a little bit of start-up around that. If I had to boil all that down and say you\u2019re probably looking at 100 basis points of headwinds inside Q2."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Thank you. My follow-up question is actually just on your sales outlook, the low to mid single-digit growth. Can you perhaps breakout how you see the new construction versus the repair and remodel piece within the guidance?"

         "Speaker": "Garik Shmois"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So just to say, I don\u2019t have exact percentages to break that down. But when you look at each of the end markets, our builders are obviously very optimistic based on how they just wrapped up most recent months and you\u2019ve seen the starts data as well improving significantly over the last two months.",
            "So we expect that to continue as we go forward to be really strong for our business. Our stock platform, both in the kitchen and bath space continues to perform very well. We think that\u2019ll be strong inside the home centers. Our MTO platform, however, the special order business, I think, is going to continue to lag.",
            "We did see an improving trend in incoming order rates throughout our first quarter, so I think that\u2019ll help us into the second quarter. But I think we\u2019ll still continue to be challenged there. And then with respect to dealers and distributors, we\u2019re seeing improving trends in that particular space as well.",
            "So we \u2013 when we take all that together, that gives us a bit of a wide range. I do recognize low to mid as a bit of a wide range. But some of the variables are our ability to actually be able to recruit and retain individuals to be able to meet the demand is one of the factors that will determine how much we actually will ship inside the quarter."

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. I guess my follow-up question on that and my last question would be just with respect to some of the labor bottlenecks. Is there a concern that, not just on this quarter, but would you anticipate some of these potential bottlenecks to continue in the mid to long-term?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Garik Shmois"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So I think the \u2013 specifically around two of the items that I addressed, the CARES Act, obviously, that\u2019s a \u2013 still a bit influx. The initial $600 weekly payment has stopped. Obviously, the President has asked for the $400. I think Arizona is still the only state that\u2019s actually executed and started making payments specifically around that. That\u2019s a factor, we\u2019ll see exactly how that plays out here near-term and medium-term.",
            "Heat is going to be something that\u2019ll help us. The heat is an impact when you\u2019re having to wear a mask in a facility and it\u2019s difficult to work, so our folks are really taxed from that perspective. So when the heat mitigates, I think, that\u2019s an opportunity that will improve as we get into the fall and winter months."

            "\u2026hey. First, just wanted to follow-up on the new res portion of your business. You all have heavy exposure there. How is your backlog looking? And could you just help us with the cadence of the new res revenue trend? If you look at calendar 2Q starts, they were a bit softer. But now, we\u2019re hearing builder orders are very exceptional over the summer months. So any way you can help us kind of walk through that over the next several quarters would be really appreciated?"

            "Yes. I\u2019m not going to lean in on a couple of quarters worth of data, Truman, but certainly we can talk about what the trends have been since the start of the fiscal year. And just as a reminder, on new construction, we lag two to three months after starts. And so inside our most recent fiscal quarter, of course, we were feeling the impacts of really most of the closures and shutdown that were experienced back in March in April.",
            "So now, as we\u2019ve seen, new construction demand increase, starts increase into June and into July, two to three months from that, we\u2019ll start to see the benefit associated with those particular orders. So it\u2019ll start to help mid-end of our Q2 and then really play a bit more of a role inside our Q3."

Specifically in that, we talked about our PCS business being challenged. That is predominantly Southern California.",

When you break that apart, really strong results in the Southeast, Atlanta, as well as the Southwest and Texas, where we had a bit of a challenge was in Northern California and the Northeast. And if you reflect back earlier inside what would have been our fiscal first quarter, those were some of the states that were a bit more restricted with some of their particular procedures around COVID. So that lined up pretty well from that standpoint."

So from our perspective, promos, essentially in the retail space, we\u2019re flat to slightly lower for the most recent period.

            "Overall, in fact, our stock business, we will also have some new launches, but it\u2019s just not as significant an outcome on the front end to be able to launch those. MTO, you\u2019re dealing with displays, you\u2019re dealing with selling center doors, you\u2019re dealing with a lot of literature and material, and that\u2019s where some of the incremental costs really come into play."

You mentioned some are short-term, some are long-term. So I realize there\u2019s some variance there. But how should we be thinking about the payback for the P&L?",
            "And then secondly, if you just talk about gross margins, you had 160 basis points decline and you called out the deleverage, fixed assets and the reduced efficiencies. But it sounds like price cost, just in your response to a previous question, was relatively flat. So maybe just confirm that and then the impact of mix. But I\u2019m just hoping you can kind of unpack that gross margin 160 basis points and give us an idea of kind of the moving parts in there? Thank you."

With respect to investments, unfortunately, it\u2019s all of the above. So some are going to be short-term and some are going to be long-term in nature. Specifically, when you look at things like launches as an example, so I\u2019ll just pick that one as my example, I\u2019ll walk through.",

So in one quarter, you take the cost and future quarters, you actually get the revenue gain associated with that.",

Once we do that, we\u2019re expecting the efficiencies out of the gate to be able to help mitigate really the subscription cost associated with the cloud service in that space.

So are you thinking of the cycle as a new cycle where you\u2019ve got multiple years of growth and you\u2019re willing to kind of invest ahead of that in the new construction side? Or are you still a little bit more tentative in terms of the trajectory and kind of picking out a wait-and-see approach there?"

Just as a reminder, Justin, it\u2019s really the only kind of multi-family business we\u2019ve got. And we\u2019ve talked over the last couple of years around, is that a platform that we can expand and grow and having a more meaningful presence in multi-family.",

We\u2019ve recently recalibrated and charged the team to revisit what we think is going to be necessary to win.

            "So we still got some work to do in that space. Headwind inside the quarter was pretty meaningful. We were down double digits and it was a meaningful headwind inside the space. It basically wiped out most of our new construction direct Timberlake business gains."

I know that last year, you had some one-time incremental headwinds that I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to repeat. I think the four-year was close to 100 basis points if memory serves me. And then you also have the restructuring items that you\u2019ve already discussed last quarter, I guess. How do those offset? Or do they \u2013 do those items, at least partially offset the incremental step-up costs in the second quarter, the 100 bps that you mentioned?"

First is restructuring actions that we took at the end of Q4 last fiscal year and then the first quarter of this year. Obviously, that\u2019s opportunity for us and we\u2019ve executed those plans and that\u2019s a benefit as we push forward.",
            "Last year issues that we had, the early two, I think, you maybe are thinking about: one would have been the transition out of our Mira Loma facility into Riverside, where we had to move that PCS production facility. And that leads to incremental cost overall from a leased facility cost, et cetera. So that\u2019s the one that is still with us that doesn\u2019t really go away or mitigate.",
            "The second was around particleboard. And just as a reminder, particleboard last year was pretty choppy, because we had some quarters where we were getting recovery against the actual cost incurred and then others were feeling really the full negative impact associated with that.",
            "I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t recall off the top of my head exactly what that headwind was inside Q1 last year. I don\u2019t think it was meaningful. I think most of the impact came into the back-half of our fiscal year. On the particleboard side, I can tell you that we\u2019ve seen additional capacity come online. There\u2019s another mill that looks like we\u2019ll be opening here shortly, even with Carolina. So we\u2019ve seen stability in that particular space.

If that was the cascade into the balance of the year based on these, as you see it today, just where does \u2013 how does that project us?
