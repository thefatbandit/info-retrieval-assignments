         "Thank you, Karine. Hello, everyone. The recent commissioning in the wind and solar segments contributed to increased results this quarter compared to the same period last year, despite the curtailment imposed by BC Hydro in the Hydro segment.",
         "Production and revenues for the three-month period ended June 30 2020 were up 25% and 4%, respectively, and adjusted EBITDA was stable at $105 million compared to last year. Production proportionate, revenue proportionate and adjusted EBITDA proportionate were up by 29 -- 21%, 9% and 10%, respectively.",
         "Before going further, I'd like to stress that 2019 figures are still reported on a continued operations basis, which excludes HS Orka.",
         "On page eight. Production for the three-month period ended June 30 was 25% higher, due mainly to the contribution of the Foard City wind farm and the Phoebe solar facility, which were commissioned respectively, on September 27 and November 19, 2019. It was also driven by higher production from the Quebec wind facilities and hydro facilities in BC that were not affected by the curtailment imposed by BC Hydro, which impacted five consolidated facilities, thus partially offsetting total increased production.",
         "On page nine. Revenues were up 4% and the increase is mainly due to the commissioning of the Foard City and Phoebe facilities, higher revenues at the Quebec wind facilities and to the acquisition of the Salvador solar farm in Chile on May 14, 2020.",
         "These items were partly offset by lower revenues from the hydro facilities in BC, primarily due to the BC Hydro curtailment, along with lower average selling price at some facilities, as well as lower revenues at some Quebec hydro facilities and France wind farms.",
         "On next page. Adjusted EBITDA remained stable compared to the same quarter last year, mainly due to higher revenues and lower operational expenses at the Quebec wind facilities, the commissioning of Phoebe and Foard City, a higher contribution from the Ontario solar facility and Salvador acquisition. However, these items were offset almost exclusively by the BC Hydro curtailment.",
         "The 10% increase in adjusted EBITDA proportionate compared to the same quarter last year is mainly driven by the PTCs generated by Foard City following its commissioning in September and a higher contribution from Dokie, Toba Montrose and the Chilean facility. It was partly offset by a lower contribution from the Flat Top and Shannon and Jimmie Creek facilities, which in this case was also impacted by the curtailment.",
         "Continuing on page 12. The $278 million decrease in long-term debt is mainly due to a net $309 million repayment of the corporate credit facility from the proceeds of Hydro Quebec private placement in Innergex common shares. This item was partly offset by drawing related to the Hillcrest construction and other cash requirements.",
         "On the next page. Change in total assets stem mainly from the increase in property, plant and equipment, attributable mainly to Hillcrest and Salvador acquisition. Change in total liabilities stem from the decrease in long-term debt.",
         "The change in shareholder equity is explained by Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec private placement of 34.6 million shares, partly offset by dividend declared on common and preferred shares.",
         "As shown on the next slide, the free cash flow available for distribution of $74 million represents a decrease of $41.9 million when comparing the current trading 12-month to the same period a year ago. The unfavorable free cash flow variance is due mainly to the loss in free cash flow attributable to HS Orka, including the recovery of maintenance capital expenditure and unfavorable impact from the BC Hydro-imposed curtailment, the timing of certain project loan interest payments, which resulted in the corporation having made five quarterly payments during the trailing four quarters, and a lower generation due to unfavorable weather condition.",
         "These items were partly offset by the free cash flow contribution of recently commissioned projects and lower interest payment on the corporate revolving facilities concurrent with the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec private placement. Combined with these items, a higher dividend from Q1 and Q2 following Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec private placement has increased the payout ratio to 150%.",
         "Now that being said, let me bring you to page 15. We have normalized the payout ratio for a better appreciation of our run rate capacity. Starting from the reported $74 million free cash flow and the 150% and when taking into account the $11 million from BC Hydro curtailment, the $13 million due to timing of interest payments, the $5 million decrease in corporate revolving facilities interest payments, and the $13 million in additional dividend payment, the normalized free cash flow and payout ratio would have respectively reached $93 million and 105%.",
         "Furthermore, on a forward-looking basis, when considering a full year contribution of our two recently announced acquisition and the contribution of the Hillcrest project, the non-recurring curtailment imposed by BC Hydro, the timing of interest payments, the production at 100% of LTA levels, market softening assumption and the additional dividend, free cash flow would reach $128 million, thus bringing the payout ratio just below 100% in the next 12-month estimate.",
         "Moreover, this forecast does not take into consideration Griffin Trail or any other potential acquisition that could be achieved with the remaining unused proceeds of the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec private placement.",
         "In conclusion, considering our current outlook and the additional cash generating capacity to be derived from our growth strategy, which combine acquisition and project development, we are confident to attain a payout ratio of under 100% in the near future.",
         "On that note, I will give the floor to Michel for the operational review of the past quarter."

         "Thank you. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to specify that this conference will be held in English. Members of the media are invited to ask their questions by phone after this call. A presentation supporting today's discussion is available as we speak on the home page of our website at the www.innergex.com.",

Although, the corporation believes that the expectations and assumptions are reasonable under the current circumstances, listeners are cautioned not to rely unduly on these forward-looking statements as no assurance can be given that this will prove to be correct.",

         "During this call, we will refer to financial measures that are not recognized according to international financial reporting standards. Please refer to the non-IFRS measures section of the MD&A for more information.",
         "Our speakers today will be Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Neault, Chief Financial Officer, who will present Q2 results; and Mr. Michel Letellier, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will review our operational highlights and our Q3 priorities.",
         "I now turn the conference over to Mr. Neault."
      ],
      "Michel Letellier": [
         "Well, thank you very much, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois. First and foremost, I'd like to thank all our employees for their dedication during this crisis. I'm very, very proud of all the team. We've been very busy. And as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois mentioned, we did the acquisition and we are advancing the development portfolio very well.",
         "So, I think that in the context of the COVID-19, our team did a fantastic job in the last few months. And as a corporation, without even the COVID-19, I'm very excited on the development side and the acquisition execution. So, just to coming back on the COVID-19, as you know, we have been managing our asset on a different aspect in the sense that we have our health and safety in mind for our employees. We're still working from a distance, from home. For the time being, everything works very well. It's a little bit challenging in the sense that we are welcoming new employees as we grow. And this is a little bit of a challenge, of course, but we are adapting our leadership style to take into consideration this new reality that we all face.",
         "Now for the acquisition side, you've all seen the acquisition of the Salvador, the solar plant in Chile. We're very happy to have been able to complete it -- this acquisition. Mind you that, as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois mentioned, we have had a little bit of a delay in the execution of those acquisitions that were announced after the investment of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. But I think we were a little bit cautious given the crisis and we took our time to assess the situation. And in this case, we were able also to renegotiate a little bit the acquisition price. So, all is -- all was the best. And we maintain our, I would say, our prudent approach of deploying the -- our liquidity. And that's why also we will be talking also with Mountain Air, the wind farm that we just bought in Idaho.",
         "So, those two acquisitions are part of our strategy to balance the cash flow. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois has been talking about the payout ratio. We're mindful that we have to bring the payout ratio below 100% and into a better sustainable level. Thanks.",
         "And one of the strategy that we want to do, and I mentioned it a few times is to use M&A as a tool to rebalance our cash flow, because we are very successful. I'm and proud to report, and I'll explain a little bit the advancement we've done in the development sector. So, I think we can create a lot of value for our shareholders going forward in our own greenfield development projects. And in order to help also the cash on cash and the earlier cash flow contribution, we will be using M&A as a focused tools to help rebalance our portfolio. And Salvador and Mountain Air are good -- two good example of what we want to do. And, of course, we -- our team is focused to deliver on that strategy.",
         "So, construction activities is also very important. And as you know, we have a few projects under construction. And the biggest one is Hillcrest. And we have started the construction in the middle of the crisis last January, beginning of February. Very proud again of the team that we have been able to manage and advance the construction almost as planned. So, we have perhaps four weeks of delay that we intend to catch up, with having a little bit more personnel on the ground.",
         "As of today, we have just over 320 workers onsite. And the plan is to bring this number to about 400 by the end of the month. And so, we're very confident that we'll be able to achieve the COD date by the end of the year again. So, pretty proud of what we have been doing over there, given the COVID crisis.",
         "And a good surprise, Innavik hydro project. Last time, I was talking to you, we were not so optimistic of being able to go in the North of Quebec, given the sensitivity of these village to a potential contamination with COVID-19. But the local government were looking into having some economic activities and we found a good compromise on security and health and economic development. So, construction restart in early July. And so, we will be able to meet the COD -- or the original COD. So, happy to report on this as well.",
         "Yonne II wind project is advancing very, very fast. We're hoping to be in COD by the end of the year also. It's a small project, but I would say that it's a first giant step for us in France, because it's the first greenfield project that the team has put together. And it's the first of, hopefully, many.",
         "France is a priority for us. We're growing our team over there in terms of development. We are seeing the European Commission putting a lot of their strategy to restart the economy towards a green economy. So, we're quite happy to put a little bit more effort in France and our pipeline is growing. And hopefully, like I said, Yonne is only the first step toward putting more projects out of our greenfield pipeline in France.",
         "From another completely different part of the world, we've been very active in Hawaii. Very happy to report that we've been short-listed on two new projects, a 15 and a 20-megawatt, coupled with batteries for 60 and 80-megawatt hour battery. So, this is -- we now have four projects under development in Hawaii. Pretty happy on that aspect, because as you know, this is a sector that we want to develop. And we want to have more projects being developed in this type of approach with storage.",
         "And we're also happy to report that we won a project, a 9 megawatt hour battery storage only in France. The project is called Tonnerre. It's interesting in a sense that it's our first investment in storage only. Again, hopefully, not the first, but we will be successful in the future developing more of those type of projects, especially with our alliance with Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec.",
         "As you know, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec has a very good battery and they want to deploy that battery around the world, and we will be trying to team up with them and be successful in promoting those storage projects around the world. So, Tonnerre is the first interesting project. We won some -- we won in two an RFP and it will be installed in our Yonne facility, so which is an extension of our existing substation. So, pretty exciting about this project, not because it's a big project, but because it's a first of a new segment of business that we want to develop.",
         "And perhaps one of the surprise that we came up, and I would tell you that it was not a surprise for us, because we knew about Griffin Trail. But we've been given a very nice gift by the Treasury of the U.S. government when they extended the tax, the PTC in the U.S. Griffin Trail has had some work done in the past and we were able to qualify Griffin Trail for 100% PTC. So, that came to a very good surprise for us.",
         "Remind you that the PTC in the U.S. are starting to be about $0.025, and it has an escalation and it's good for 10 years. So, although, this project will be starting to be merchant I consider that receiving, for a period of at least 10 years, a US$0.025 per kilowatt-hour produced coming from indirectly the U.S. Treasury is in a form of a PPA.",
         "Remind you that in Quebec, in Saskatchewan and Alberta, projects were won in the 30 -- in $0.03, $0.035 per kilowatt-hour and people were happy to receive that. So US$0.025 is almost the equivalent and we have an inflator there.",
         "Also, we will be selling electricity in the spot market in ERCOT. Even though, we're seeing a weak market these days because of the COVID, the demand in ERCOT has come down by about 5%, which is not offset compared to other markets. Quebec is in that range and BC Hydro is in that range as well. So, no specific really downturn in ERCOT other than the -- it's a full merchant market, so it might react differently than other markets.",
         "But just to give you a little bit of an idea why we changed this approach is the fact that, as an example, Foard City, we have signed a PPA for $18 per megawatt hour or $0.018 per kilowatt-hour. So, this is the rate of PPA that we're seeing in ERCOT. And, of course, you don't get to have the potential update -- upside when the market are peaking or even when the future market would be better in ERCOT.",
         "It's -- those PPA are nice. But again, I think that going merchant is giving us quite a bit of upside. And we still have the option to sign a PPA if a good offer come across our board. So, very happy on that aspect in the sense that it's a project that we're in our pipeline, but we're basically on highs. And having this gift from the U.S. Treasury enable us to unwind this value that was hidden in our pipeline. And the team did a fantastic job because, of course, a lot of people got waked up by this extension of PTC. So, we were able to secure same good team that worked on Foard.",
         "We have security in Blattner for the execution of this project. And we're very confident that this project will be in COD by Q3 of 2021. We're finalizing the tax equity term sheet, as we speak. So, pretty enthusiastic about this project that basically is unlocking some value that was hidden in our pipeline.",
         "Also, I'm finishing with the Mountain Air acquisition in Idaho, what we just announced a few weeks ago. So, again, the same idea there is that good quality project that will help rebalance the cash flow of the company. It's not a change of mentality in Innergex. We are a long-term investor. But this is our way to mitigate the fact that we are paying a dividend, and we are a growing company. So, we have to have the tools to rebalance the distribution of the cash flow. And this is one way to do it, and we're quite happy on this acquisition. And like I said, the team is focused on -- the M&A team is focused on finding these type of acquisition in the near-time.",
         "Chile is also quite active. We're seeing some good deal flow. And perhaps we will be able to do some other acquisition like Salvador. So, pretty upbeat in the sense that we've been doing a lot of activities, a lot of construction and a lot of development. Weather was not on our side in this quarter and BC Hydro was not very friendly to our cause. But, of course, we are, like I said in the past, fighting back and we will defend our rights against BC Hydro for this PPA.",
         "I'm very confident that we'll succeed in defending our rights under this PPA. But other than that, pretty -- very, very proud again on my team. And I thank all the Innergex team for this great success in the last few months, given the COVID-19 challenge.",
         "So, on that, I would open the floor."

            "My first question here, just on the curtailment of BC Hydro. I believe when the news first came out, there was a $20 million expected revenue hit. And I think you saw $11 million in the current quarter or in 2Q. Should we expect the balance of that to fall in 3Q? Or has something changed there potentially?"

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "No. You're right. It's just the fact that we -- the curtailment was effective until July 20. So, we will see still a 20 days of July being under curtailment."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, maybe just a question on your U.S. development pipeline. I know that -- I think last call, we mentioned -- or you mentioned a couple of the solar projects in PJM in Ohio. You said at least 100 megawatts, but you're trying to get more land and potentially increase the size of those. I am wondering if you have any update there."
         ],
         "Speaker": "David Quezada"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't mention it. The team is also quite active there. We are expanding on the land. We are just cautious on starting projects for 2021 in the U.S., given the fact that those would benefit from ITC. And ITC is a little bit different than PTC in the sense that you get the benefit, the tax advantage on the year the project is put in COD. And perhaps some tax equity provider might be a little bit more nervous in 2021, given the fact of the state of the economy. So, we are cautious on putting solar in 2021. Hence, we're happy to have now Griffin Trail being developed for 2021, and this is a PTC. So, less of a concern in the sense that the tax equity provider have 10 years to take advantage of those tax equity credit.",
            "But no. The team is very active. We are also opening up a good development platform in the Northwest of the U.S. A lot of these areas have developed some aggressive policy towards having more renewable in their portfolio. So, we're getting ready also to answer some RFP in that region of the state, as well."

      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Great. Thanks. Just -- my first question relates to Griffin. So, in terms of going merchant, like what's your -- like are you also assuming that your -- like obviously, you had to decide whether you want to hedge or go merchant, and you have various kind of return expectations. From your perspective, what is the return premium for merchant versus hedging?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Nelson Ng"
      },
      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, it's very difficult to answer that in the sense that this is driven a lot by future price of electricity and you could have a few curve. We're quite conservative when we're proposing this project to our board. We're taking Wood Mackenzie without carbon as a kind of a reference. So, this is probably one of the most conservative curve out there and we're basing our decision -- financial decision on that. But I'll give you a little bit of very, very general and rough numbers. ",
            "The project will probably be cost around $280 million, roughly. PTC -- just the PTC, we -- we're going to get something around $21 million to $22 million of PTC as a run rate and I'm not taking into the inflation in consideration. And, of course, we expect to invest something around $110 million, $116 million our share of equity. The rest will be tax equity. We expect to have something around $10 million of distribution from that project in different ways.",
            "We're going to have Pay-go. We're going to also have some revenue from the spot price. But I think that we are looking into something around 8% to 10% cash on cash. And for a tax equity deal, this is not bad. And we've seen a lot of other bigger players doing just that and walking away from very cheap PPA that was basically flat or levelized for 10 years, 12 years at a range of $15 to $18 per megawatt hour. That's what we're seeing now in the market. That's what we're getting from the merchant portion of CB and Foard.",
            "And so, it's hard to think that the market will be a lot lower than this range, even considering the COVID-19 situation in Texas. So, I think that we keep the upside going forward. So, even if there were to be some carbon introduced -- tax introduced or limitation introduced in the United States, I think that these type of project will see a very good upside.",
            "And we'll see also with the U.S. election in November if the Democrat -- if Biden gets in, I think that U.S. investment will benefit -- green energy will benefit from his election. And if Trump stays in there, it cannot be worse than what we have seen in the last four years. So, we're still very positive about our investment in U.S."

      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. That's good color. And then, in terms of raising tax equity, does tax equity typically require hedges for projects? Or do you think they've become more comfortable with unhedged?"

         "Speaker": "Nelson Ng"
      },
      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, they were requiring it. And we -- I think that given the fact that we have now delivered good project in time and in budget, that was helping also. So, we have some good relationship with some few tax equity providers that we have leveraging now and that are accepting the fact that Innergex can do that type of project.",
            "So, it's -- I think it's a great, I would say, outcome. Because two years ago, we wouldn't -- we would not have been able to develop a project in this way. And hence, Foard City, we had to accept a PPA of about $18 flat for 12 years. So, we were happy to have it at the time, because it unlocked the tax equity. But I think that the Griffin Trail proposal is a better economic proposal for us going forward."

You guys mentioned that you only bought the -- like one class of -- I think, the Class B shares like the equity rather than the tax equity. Given that the project is about eight -- or 8.5 years old, is -- like when is the expected flip date for tax equity? And what -- and then \u2026"

We may have some discussion in the future to acquire the remaining portion of that -- the project. But it will be a negotiation with MetLife. They don't have to sell. We don't have to buy. But if we can find the sweet spot between the two of us, we might execute on that as well."

So, this will pay 70% to 75% of the project in the next 10 years.",

We were -- we have insurance coverage for that. But we are in discussion -- intense discussion with Vestas to find the problem with these blades.",

            "Hi. Good morning. So, my questions have been answered, but just maybe two quick follow-ups. I guess, follow-up on Ben's questions. Just maybe if you can expand more of your thoughts on overall merchant exposure. When you think about new projects that you're developing or acquiring, be it solar, wind, going forward, what do you think is the right mix of merchant assets like Griffin Trail or Salvador versus maybe contracted assets? Like, how comfortable -- how much merchant exposure, I guess, are you comfortable taking on from a portfolio perspective?"

We have decided to move Griffin Trail in that fashion because of the knowledge we have gained over the past few years on the Texas market. And as Michel mentioned, we're pretty confident using the Wood Mac no carbon curve that we are conservative. So -- and that Griffin Trail project will not change that much our overall mix exposure to merchants.",
            "So, it's too early. But, of course, Chilean market and the ERCOT market makes you have a greater exposure on merchant. So -- but commenting further down, it would not be reasonable for me to comment too long away in our average threshold here so."

I would remind you that project in France are smaller, around 20 megawatts, something like that. So, every quarter, we're progressing on that. So, we're confident to -- so Yonne is our first greenfield project, very happy with it.",

And the team also started to reflect on may be some solar opportunity as well. So that's another nice initiative from the team there. So, we're happy. So, I just want to remain conservative and -- with my forecast to you."
