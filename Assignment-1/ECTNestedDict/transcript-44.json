         "Thanks, Traci, and good morning and thank you everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results reflect our position in the market as the leading workspace company, empowering employees with a secure and consistent work experience, wherever it is the work needs to be done, in the office, on the road, whereas we\u2019ve all recently experienced at home.",
         "Even when geographies and economies became to reopen, this concept of back to the office is moving beyond the discussion of just one mode versus the other. I think there is a realization at many companies, but a hybrid work style blends together the best attributes from a physical work environment with the flexibility that individuals need to be productive and do their best work.",
         "All of this will be dependent upon technologies like those provided by Citrix to ensure a safe, secure and productive work experience across all locations. I\u2019m really proud of our team and the commitment to customer success that I\u2019ve seen throughout 2020.",

         "Speaker": "Hi, guys. Congratulations on another strong quarter. David, a question for you, on penetration, obviously we\u2019ve seen, I call it, more people that haven\u2019t been able to work remotely, you\u2019ve start to work -- be able to work from home now and it seems like permanent work and flexible work to your point is just here to stay. How do you think about the ability to drive up to get the number of users that have access to Citrix, but as usage of Citrix also goes up more people using it concurrently, how do you think about penetration of that call that user base with licenses, so call it, the total user base growing than your license penetration of that? And then I\u2019ll just have a one follow-up for Arlen."
      },
      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, Phil. Thanks. I think the big takeaway coming out of this great work-from-home experiment is that, remote work is really in fact working and so I don\u2019t think perceptions of remote work have shifted more quickly than it has right now.",
            "I mean you take a step back, and as you mentioned, you have over 40% of the U.S. workforce now working from home, delivering somewhere over 60% of total economic output. So it\u2019s fascinating to us to see that leaders in general are really realizing the benefit that remote work is bringing to their organizations and so it\u2019s really becoming clear that hybrid work models are going to be here to stay. And you\u2019ve seen a lot of these statistics and we\u2019ve talked about some of them, CFOs are talking about reduction in everything from real estate portfolios to non-essential travel trade shows, et cetera.",
            "And so when we take a step back, I mean, now that we\u2019ve effectively crossed the chasm for remote work not being seen as a perk or a unique attribute for a select few, it\u2019s going to become much more mainstream and for us, that just means ability to accelerate penetration across our installed base, as well as tapping into net new customers.",
            "So from a long-term standpoint, I think, all the trends that we\u2019ve seen up till this point should really benefit this idea that work is truly an activity about driving output and it\u2019s not a place. And the one constant in all that is the need for a digital infrastructure that is flexible, that is secure, that is providing that level of engagement regardless of where people choose to work. So I see it as definitely a long-term positive for the business."

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. And then just a follow-up obviously the other big announcement this month was the extension of the partnership with Microsoft, obviously, that\u2019s longstanding back to the late \u201890\u2019s when Bill Gates talked about network computers. I wonder if you could just comment on just sort of the evolution of that partnership from year \u201897, \u201898 with network computers and MetaFrame to now with windows virtual, desktop and then Citrix Cloud and sort of how that symbiotic relationship sort of still applies?"

         "Speaker": "Phil Winslow"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. So if you take a step back and you think about, this is one of the longest partnerships across all of the technology that I can certainly remember. And the reason it\u2019s worked so well for all these years is that, Citrix is largely about embracing and extending the Microsoft platform for a number of our technologies. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why it works so well throughout the \u201890s and 2000s, but where we are right now is really announcing a more holistic and programmatic approach than anything we\u2019ve seen in over a decade.",
            "We\u2019re creating joint SKUs, joint roadmaps and a really comprehensive approach to give our customers a much clearer understanding of Microsoft Technologies and Citrix Technologies together, that roadmap to know how we\u2019re adding value and then the infrastructure to really help them simplify the move to the cloud, make it easy to adopt Citrus Cloud, make it easy to adopt Microsoft Azure and I think that\u2019s going to be a really powerful combination as we go into the next couple of years."

         "Remarks": [
            "Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. David, I wanted to ask a little bit to follow-up on the question that Phil was just asking. Again, you talked about this having a higher penetration rate, but when you\u2019re -- one of the questions we get asked a lot is when companies -- what are you hearing from CIOs, when companies do go back to work? There are some people that are afraid that this -- that -- it\u2019s a big push for VDI or desk is actually going to go away and people might migrate back to how they were doing things before. If you can share with us some of the conversations you had with people that maybe thought this work-from-home was going to be a short-term situation at first and now it turned into something that\u2019s going to be much longer. How has those conversations progressed in terms of how they feel about this permanently altering instead of just temporarily altering how they\u2019re delivering compute to their employees?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Heather Bellini"
      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. Heather, I think, it\u2019s a combination both from a CIO standpoint, as well as executive leadership. On the executive leadership side, there is a perception pre-pandemic that remote working wasn\u2019t necessarily working. I think it\u2019s been that it\u2019s probably been the single biggest eye opener for a lot of people is the recognition that remote work is actually way more productive in some instances.",
            "And so when you look at the research that our research team has done Stanford Economic Institute, a number of different organizations, the conclusion is that most businesses are looking at adopting a much more programmatic approach to flexible work, anywhere from one day a week, three days a week, you see us significantly higher than it has been.",
            "And again, the one constant there is that the need to provide a level of infrastructure that gives people the resources, the access, the security, the visibility, et cetera, that they need regardless of where they happen to be working.",
            "And then you kind of take a big step back and you think about what we have been discussing for the last couple of years around the future of the work, how we as an organization and our Workspace can help remove a lot of the noise that comes with work, automating and simplifying a simple tasks, engagement with your underlying systems of record, so that we can help from -- everything from a deployment standpoint and employee productivity standpoint, and everything in between. So I think it\u2019s going to be a material change for quite some time."

            "Thank you very much and congrats on the strong quarter. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to ask a couple of related questions. Your SaaS ARR is up nicely Q-over-Q, while your paid subscribers, ex the healthcare organization was up modestly. Are you seeing an increase in revenue per success subscriber and then follow-up?"

      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. Mark, we only haven\u2019t broken out revenue by paid subscribers really depends on the solution that they\u2019re adopting. Longer-term what we\u2019re obviously looking for is strategically to get people onto the Workspace platform that is really the horizontal platform layer that is applicable to every single user in the enterprise, regardless of whether they\u2019re a power user and they need all of the capabilities that come with a full virtual infrastructure or whether they\u2019re just using a couple of SaaS applications and Office 365. We can provide value and incremental capabilities.",
            "And then once we\u2019re in that platform, it allows us to better segment users to be able to add on incremental capabilities like analytics, like different forms of connectivity and contextual items. And so strategically that\u2019s really where we\u2019re driving, much more of a better segmentation of users versus just trying to put everybody on the most expensive SKU."

We, certainly, we had a very strong cash flow for the quarter and I think that\u2019s really reflective of the breadth and the scope of our customer base, obviously geographically, as well as across industries. And we\u2019ve had, what I would say, a handful of requests around extended payments, but generally, we\u2019ve had pretty much business as usual in terms of our cash flow and our ability to collect."

That\u2019s certainly as you know in the first quarter we had a fair number of those that obviously tailed off in the second quarter to an immaterial amount. And as we exit the year and approach the beginning of next year, we\u2019ll be very focused on converting those customers."

David, can you talk a bit -- a little bit about the dynamic you have pointed out in your letter around people just maybe taking it in between step of on-premise term and then only later going to like the pure cloud cloud and in terms of like, is that just kind of to sweat the asset on the on-premise side, what are drivers there? And talk a little bit about the implications that\u2019s you highlighted on the revenue side as well in your letter?"

      "26": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, Raimo. I think, it\u2019s less about sweating the assets and more just a recognition that 90% plus of our installed base is still on-premises. It was the easiest thing for a lot of them to do to just expand as they were making a rush to put people into a remote work environment back in the end of Q1 timeframe.",
            "So I think it\u2019s an interim step. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at it right now. I mean, those customers that have already made the move to cloud, we have one large financial institution for example. But they came to us, and said, I have no idea where we would have done with our tens of thousands of individuals have we not made those investments in the cloud already. So I -- there is a recognition that cloud consumption\u2026"

            "\u2026 Citrus Cloud, public cloud, et cetera, will continue to increase and probably accelerate due to this environment and the flexibility that it affords. But for us it\u2019s just a matter of individual steps. As we talked about last quarter, customers were focused on more of the triage mode in Q1 and early Q2. And because of that, we\u2019ve seen a number of projects, the larger projects like the cloud conversion just gets pushed out a little longer and so no change directionally, just a matter of sequencing."

They were up well over 20% in the first quarter and so, probably, pulled business out of Q2 into Q1, I mean, the largest indicator and then there is mix underneath that. But I would look at it more from a first half performance across all the regions."

Arlen and David, wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the fact that you end -- you\u2019re stopping the professional sales on October 1, what impact that will have on the Q3, Q4 perpetual licensing in Q4 falls off quite a bit, even in the past as sort of pull-forward will never come [Technical Difficulty] curious on that and then had a follow-up?"

            "I think in fourth quarter, obviously, we have taken that into account, right? So when you think about the fact that we\u2019re going to no longer offer perpetual plus maintenance licenses to customers in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s reflected and how we are thinking about the business, and obviously, that creates somewhat of a headwind depending on the mix and how we think about the performance through that quarter."

            "As we\u2019ve moved to much more of a software approach, much more of as a service approach, it\u2019s just gives us a lot more flexibility to reposition many of these technologies, for example, as Workspace connectivity, Workspace performance, Workspace security and the story around better together is absolutely real.",

That\u2019s just a trend that\u2019s been in place for a while and it\u2019s continuing right now. I think that\u2019s something that we should expect on the straight line, but directionally up into the right for quite some time."

David is there any way you could sort of size that opportunity for us as COVID hit and customers move to remote work posture. How much of that is sort of a real time demand was or customers sort of leaned into that option for remote work. And what do you see as the opportunity whether it\u2019s from a devices or users or a customer perspective to convert those VPN connections to its remote desktop?"

Sanjit, I think, it\u2019s actually -- it\u2019s a much longer opportunity, it\u2019s probably still the predominant way that people access their network, even though it\u2019s somewhat of an old technology, it\u2019s in place and so VPN replacement with a more modern approach to a digital workspace that provides a different level of, not just conductivity, but a different level of productivity and engagement and kind of a holistic nature of delivering resources to employees is the broader way to think about this over a period of time.",
            "And so, I think, there a lot of companies that have had VPN in place or just extended that. It\u2019s easy, it\u2019s relatively cheap, but now they\u2019re coming back and recognizing the constraints on that, whether it\u2019s performance or just some of the other attributes we\u2019ve talked about that are necessary to give people access to everything they need to do their job and then continue to be productive.

And then as a follow up question, it sort of goes back to the conversation on cloud, you seem to hit that, right now there is some app modernization projects or cloud initiatives that are just frankly tough to do in the current environment. But as you look at the Citrix customer base, what are their key friction points in terms of moving to cloud, what are some of the considerations that they have to deal with or the obstacles that they have to get through to more aggressively move to a cloud posture?"

And if you look at our trend on product and license over the past several quarters and we\u2019re down 8%, this quarter, but we\u2019ve been -- have a larger acceleration in other quarters.

I realize you all talk about this one healthcare client that wasn\u2019t able to sort of shift over to the SaaS model. But can you just talk about renewal rates in general on the cloud, are they basically trending in line with what you would expect better. I know you\u2019re not going to provide anything quantitative, but maybe just any qualitative color on that? And then, secondly, you all are obviously in a work from home profile as well. Just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about sort of sales and marketing efficiency longer term, now that you\u2019ve been in sort of more of a virtual selling model for a couple quarters. Are there some new opportunities for efficiency on that front as you think back towards a more normalized environment hopefully in \u201821? Thanks."

I mean, we had probably our largest Workspace customer in the world look for a bespoke transaction where they had a time bound opportunity to the cloud, relatively short and based on their own priorities that period has lapsed. So those licenses reverted back to being a traditional on-premise perpetual license. We\u2019ll work to trade them up and to Citrix Cloud when they\u2019re ready in the future. So I think that was all pretty straightforward.",

The focus on customer success driving active use and whatnot, so our underlying renewal rates have been increasing across the Board."

First, Arlen, I think, last quarter you talked about 1,000 new customers in the quarter, any chance you can give us some sort of a benchmark what was the performance this quarter?
