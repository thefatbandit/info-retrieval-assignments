         "Thank you, Eli. I would like to draw your attention to the financials of the second quarter of 2020. During this call, I will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Eltek uses EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial performance measurement. Please see our earnings release for its definition and the reason for its use.",
         "Now, I will go over the highlights of the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019. As Eli mentioned, revenues for the second quarter of 2020 were 8.8 million, up from revenues of 8.2 million in the second quarter of 2019. Gross profit increased from 1.3 million or 15.3% of revenues in the second quarter of 2019 to 1.9 million or 21.6% in the second quarter of 2020.",
         "During the second quarter of 2020, we had an operating profit of 809,000, as compared to an operating profit of 7,000 in the second quarter of 2019. Net profit was 704,000 or $0.16 per share in the second quarter of 2020, compared to a net profit of 790,000, or $0.19 per share in the second quarter of 2019. The results of the second quarter of 2019 were positively affected by non-recurring other income of 871,000 as a result of a receipt of an insurance payment associated with damage incurred to one of our manufacturing machines.",
         "EBITDA was approximately 1.2 million in the second quarter of 2020, as compared to EBITDA of 1.25 million in the second quarter of 2019. During the second quarter of 2020, we had positive operating cash flow of 1.4 million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of 301,000 in the second quarter of 2019. During the first half of 2020, the company achieved a positive operating cash flow of $2.9 million as compared to positive operating cash flow of $1.3 million in the first half of 2019.",
         "As Eli mentioned before, we remain focused on operational excellence and financial discipline, as well as our long-term strategic growth goals. As previously announced, we filed a registration statement during the third quarter of 2019 to provide the company with the ability to raise additional funds. The company is also considering different options to fund raising to support our plan to grow and expand our business.",
         "We are now ready to take your questions."

      "Eli Yaffe": [
         "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and welcome to Eltek\u2019s 2020 second quarter earning call. With me is Alon Mualem, our Chief Financial Officer. We will begin by providing you with an overview of our business, a summary of the principal factors that affect our results in the second quarter of 2020, and then update how COVID-19 has impacted our business, followed by the details of our financial results.",
         "After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to answer any of your questions. By now, everyone should have access to our second quarter earning press release, which was released earlier today. The release will be also available on our website at www.nisteceltek.com. This is the sixth quarter in row that we achieved both operating and net profit.",
         "Our revenue in the second quarter of 2020 rose to $8.8 million from $8.2 million in the second quarter of 2019. Revenues for the six months of 2020 were $17.9 million, compared to $16.9 million in the first six months of 2019. This growth is a result of 11% growth in sales to customers in Israel and reflects year-over-year growth in sales to defense segments in the [contract electronics manufacturers].",
         "I'm also pleased with the continued improvement in production efficiency that is evidenced in our improved gross margins and operating profits. Our diversified end market allowed us to grow revenue year-over-year despite the weakness in Indian markets. In addition, strong operational execution overcome production inefficiency and extra costs due to the COVID-19.",
         "The COVID-19 pandemic has created operational difficulties, macroeconomic uncertainty, and employees concern. I'm extremely proud how Eltek\u2019s employees have worked to deliver excellent performance despite challenging environments. We have had three employees who had tested positive for COVID-19 this year, with other returning to work after being cleared follow existing quarantine protocols.",
         "We continue to use contact tracing and quarantine individuals who are in close contact with the infected team members in addition to the deep cleaning affected work area. We also continue other measures such as extensive internal communication, masking, temperature checks, and proper distancing in our facility. Because of the preventive measures in place and our culture of transparency and communication, these events have minimal impact on our manufacturing operational to date.",
         "The outbreak of the coronavirus has created new operational and business challenges, which required quick adjustment to enable us to maintain our production of PCB, while maintaining the safety of our workforce. We see both risks and new opportunities in the existing business environment and are making the necessary adoptions to meet customer's demands and our revenue and profit margin goals.",
         "As we said in the past, we also see an opportunity to grow our business in the U.S. market due to the worsening relationship between the U.S. and China. The impact of any trade war between the U.S. and China will also impact the Israeli market since we see U.S. pressure on the Israeli Government to reduce the Israeli Chinese trade activities. At the same time, we are also facing a slowdown from some of our customers in India to the continued negative impact of COVID-19 in this territory.",
         "So far, we have financed our growth strategy by our positive operating cash flow and our own internal resources. During 2020 and 2021, we plan to increase our investment in new equipment and expansion of our facility and infrastructure to support our long-term sales growth. The increase in our top line 2020 reflects the continued market recognition of our high quality and reliable products, mainly in the flex PCB sectors.",
         "Our revenue from the defense sector and contract electronic manufacturers grew from $13.8 million during the first half of 2019 to $15.3 million in the first half of 2020, 11% growth year-over-year. The medical sectors contribute 9.7% of our revenue during the first half of 2020, representing 4% growth year-over-year. Our customers continue to see the value proposition of our product, and as a great deal of interest in our company and its capabilities.",
         "We are continuing to pursue new business opportunities and increase customer design engagement activities that will leverage our advanced technology capability. We remain focused on operational excellence and financial discipline, as well as our strategic growth goals. We are all focused in addressing the challenges that are widespread as crisis is on us and are working [delightly] to expanding our business while maintaining the trend of improved growth and operation results.",
