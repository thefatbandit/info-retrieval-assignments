         "Thank you, Luc and good morning everyone. Looking at the financial highlights for the second quarter, our consolidated second quarter adjusted operating cash flow before transaction and other costs per share was $0.23 per share, which was $0.05 higher than the prior year quarter due to the increase in adjusted EBITDA and decreased interest expense, partially offset by an increase in cash taxes.",
         "Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates on our variable rate debt and modestly lower average debt levels. Superior consolidated net income of $7.5 million compared to a net loss of $29.3 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher unrealized gains on derivative contracts and foreign currency translation of borrowings and lower SG&A costs, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense.",
         "Turning now to the individual business results. Canadian Propane EBITDA from operations for the second quarter was $21.3 million, a $1.2 million increase compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher adjusted gross profit and lower operating expenses. Adjusted gross profit increased compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to effective margin management and a low wholesale propane price environment, partially offset by lower sales volume.",
         "Average unit margins were $0.194 per liter compared to $0.169 per liter in the prior year quarter, due to margin management initiatives and customer mix, partially offset by modestly weaker wholesale propane fundamentals. Total sales volumes were 360 million liters, a decrease of 77 million liters or 18%. This was primarily due to reduced demand in the wholesale, oilfield, commercial and motor fuel segments. Average weather across Canada as measured by degree days, was 2% colder than the prior year quarter and 8% colder than the five-year average. Operating expenses were $6.4 million lower due to cost reductions in response to lower sales volumes.",
         "U.S. Propane EBITDA from operations for the second quarter was $27.1 million, an increase of $14.3 million compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to average unit margins, higher average unit margins and lower operating expenses, partially offset by modestly lower sales volumes.",
         "Average unit margins were $0.462 per liter compared to $0.387 per liter in the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to lower wholesale propane prices and effective management of pricing in a low commodity price environment, the impact from the translation of U.S.-denominated gross profit and to a lesser extent customer mix related to a focus on organic growth of higher-margin propane customers.",
         "Total sales volumes decreased 11 million liters or 5%, primarily due to the lower commercial and wholesale volumes, partially offset by higher residential volume. Average weather, as measured by degree days, across the markets where Superior operates in the Eastern U.S. was 30% colder than the prior year quarter and 28% colder than the five-year average.",
         "Colder weather is less of an impact in the second quarter due to lower demand from heating end-use customers. Operating expenses were $5.5 million lower than the prior year quarter, due to cost reductions related to workforce optimization initiatives and realized synergies from acquisitions.",
         "Turning now to specialty chemicals. EBITDA from operations for the second quarter was $28.6 million, a $10 million decrease compared to the prior year quarter. This is primarily due to lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Gross profit decreased due to lower chlor-alkali sales prices and volume and lower sodium chlorate sales volume, partially offset by higher sodium chlorate, sales prices and lower electricity mill rates. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to cost reduction initiatives related to COVID-19, lower freight costs related to reduced sales volumes and the impact of the closure of the Saskatoon sodium chlorate facility which occurred in 2019.",
         "Lastly, to talk about corporate results and the adjusted EBITDA and leverage guidance. Corporate costs were $7 million, a decrease of $1.5 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower discretionary spending and cost reductions related to COVID-19 and the lower LTIP expense related to the share price decline.",
         "Interest expense was $24.3 million, a decrease of $2.2 million. This was primarily due to lower average interest rates on variable rate debt and modestly lower average debt level. Interest rates on variable rate debt were lower due to interest rate cuts by the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve in 2020. In the second quarter, Superior had cash income tax expenses of $2.6 million, a modest increase from prior year.",
         "We still expect to finish at the lower end of our 2020 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $475 million to $550 million, primarily due to significantly warmer-than-average weather experienced in the first quarter in the U.S. as well as the anticipated impact from COVID-19 and the lower price of oil on our business and our customers.",
         "Average weather, as measured by degree days, for the remainder of 2020 is anticipated to be consistent with the five-year average for Canada and the U.S. The low end of the range accounts for warmer-than-normal weather for the remainder of 2020, further weakness in economic activity in Western Canada, further weakness in North American caustic soda and hydrochloric acid market and any further volume decline related to COVID-19.",
         "The high end of the range accounts for colder-than-normal weather for the rest of 2020, wholesale propane market fundamentals, similar to 2019, increased drilling activity in Western Canada, improved North American caustic soda and hydrochloric acid market and faster economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "From a debt and leverage perspective, the total debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio for the trailing 12 months as of June 30, 2020, was 3.7 times. This compares to 4 times at March 31, 2019. The increase in the leverage ratio from March 31, 2019, was primarily due to higher adjusted EBITDA and lower debt as cash generated from operations was used to repay debt and the impact of the stronger Canadian dollar on the translation of Superior's U.S.-denominated debt. We're confirming our guidance for total debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage at December 31, 2020, to a range of 3 to 3.5 times consistent with our prior disclosure on June 8, 2020.",
         "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Q&A."
      ],
      "Luc Desjardins": [
         "Well, thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Overall, we delivered good results in the second quarter considering the challenges we were facing related to reduced economy activity, reduced activity in the oil field and challenging hydrochloric acid market in Specialty Chemicals.",
         "Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $67.3 million, $8 million or 13% higher than the prior year quarter, primarily due to an increase in EBITDA from operations and lower corporate costs.",
         "I'm proud of the fact that our dedicated workforce over 4000 employees have been able to maintain safe and reliable operation during this challenging time. We continue to deliver critical energy specialty chemical products to our customers and safely service the community in which we operate.",
         "The resilience demonstrated by our team members from every level of the organization gives me confidence, we will continue to execute our strategy and maintain our commitment to safety and continuous improvement through operational excellence. At Superior Plus, we have continued with our modified business practices with the health and safety of our employees, our customers and local community as our first priority.",
         "As our propane distribution and Specialty Chemicals businesses are considered essential and critical services and infrastructure in all the provinces, territories and states in which we operate in the U.S., Canada and Chile. We have continued to service our customers that have been classified as essential.",
         "In response, we anticipate the impact of COVID-19 as a part of our ongoing cost-saving initiative. We took immediate action to protect our business and financial strength in the effort to position Superior to emerge from this situation even stronger. In 2020, we have reduced our planned capital expenditure by about $30 million and reduced our expected operational expense by $30 million, even though we continue to look into all those costs. So more is coming.",
         "I'm proud to tell you we are on plan for the cost reduction and capital expenditures reduction as of the second quarter. Consistent with our first quarter updated, we expect to finish 2020 at the lower end of our previously communicated adjusted EBITDA range of $475 million to $515 million, primarily due to the impact of the warm winter in the eastern region of U.S. and Canada, as well as the anticipated impact from COVID-19 and the low price of oil reduced drilling activity impacting the Western Canadian economy.",
         "Although we had an excellent second quarter due to strong propane distribution margin, cost reduction and colder weather in April and May, we still anticipate there will be modest negative impact on our business due to the economic recession related to COVID-19 shutdown and the lower price of oil and reduced drilling activity.",
         "We have done a super job of adapting and adjusting to the decline in our sales volume related to slowdown of the economy and the low price of oil, which enabled us to maintain our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2020 at the lower end. I'm proud of our employees and our ability to respond quickly to this unprecedented situation.",
         "I would like to mention some highlights of the second quarter in recent weeks following the end of the quarter. On June 8, we announced that Brookfield would invest US$ 260 million in our Superior exchangeable preferred share investment and we closed the transaction on July 13. We have used the proceed from Brookfield Investment to immediately reduce our debt and leverage and we plan to use our ample liquidity and ability to execute on acquisition to more aggressively pursue acquisition finally in the U.S. retail propane distribution space. We have never seen a backlog of potential acquisition as we have right now. ",
         "On August 3, we closed on the acquisition of Champagne's Energy, US$27.3 million which had an additional 42 million liters for U.S. propane distribution business in the Maine. We have many opportunity to grow requisition in the Eastern U.S. and in California and we have a robust like I said earlier, bigger pipeline than we've ever had in the last many years.",
         "We expect there will be more acquisition opportunity coming out of the economy slowdown as many small and mid-sized propane retail distributor company has been negatively impact and not commercial customer demand and increased cost to do business as many of them are aging and there are 70,000 personnel -- the whole market in the state being independent, no doubt that people are requestioning their lives going forward and more and more deals will come our way.",
         "We continue to realize synergy of NGL retail acquisition in our recent tuck-in acquisition. We still expect to exit 2020 with at least US$24 million in run rate synergy related to NGL. We were able to reduce our operating expense in the U.S. propane distribution business by $5.5 million in the second quarter compared to prior year quarter due workforce optimization initiative, utilizing our Superior operating platform we developed in the Canadian propane distribution business and we're now applying it to our U.S. business.",
         "Second quarter EBITDA from operations was $76.9 million, $5.5 million or 8% increase from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher results from U.S. propane and Canadian propane, partially offset by some lower results from the Specialty Chemicals. In the second quarter, the U.S. Propane result increased compared to prior year quarter due to higher margin and lower operating expense, partially offset by lower sales volume.",
         "U.S. Propane EBITDA from operation for 2020 is anticipated to be lower than 2019, but not by too much, but primarily due by the significant warmer weather experienced in the first quarter. When you think of the first quarter warm weather cost us $30 million of EBITDA and we are calling it that it will be on our guidance this year. So partially offset by incremental contribution from tuck-in acquisition, we didn't have too many in the past there will be a lot in the future and complete our 2020 and fourth quarter of 2019. The incremental synergy related to NGL acquisition and the tuck-in acquisition.",
         "Canadian Propane result for the second quarter were modestly higher than the prior year quarter due to decrease in operating expense and higher average margin, partially offset by the decrease in volume due to the economy. Canadian Propane EBITDA from operation 2020 is anticipated to be lower than 2019, somewhat primarily due to an expected decrease in sales volume and average in this margin, partially offset by a decrease in operating expense. Sales volume are expected to decrease due to the impact of COVID-19 reduced activity in the oil and gas in Western Canada and the related low price of oil.",
         "Specialty Chemicals EBITDA from operations in the second quarter was somewhat lower, primarily due to the decrease in sales volume of chlor-alkali price, partially offset by a modest increase in sodium chlorate price, the decrease in electricity costs and the reduction of operating expense again. Specialty Chemicals EBITDA from operation for 2020 is anticipated to be lower than 2019, due to an expected decrease in chlor-alkali gross profit, partially offset by a modest increase in sodium chlorate gross profit and a modest decrease in operating expense.",
         "So, now I'll turn the call over to Beth to discuss the financial result in more detail."

            "Strong results. With the strong quarter though effective margin management, I think, Luc had flagged last time $10 million to $11 million in permanent savings. FX is working your way and then you're going to close Champagne, and congratulations on Champagne in the third quarter. I would have thought you might have raised your guidance more towards the midpoint of your range. So you touched on it and certainly Q1 was tough, but the guidance was provided at the end of Q1 then you had a better quarter. What are the key reasons you think overall for your caution? Is it just COVID oil and gas Western Canada caustic rolling over and hydrochloric acid? Maybe long-winded question, but just trying to get a sense of where your head was at on setting the guidance where it is."
         ],
         "Speaker": "David Newman"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Very good point. And maybe I will start a bit and give you more color. There's no doubt that there's a lot of variable things going out there that we cannot forecast completely as we did in the past years and be more in tune by the million, which we did in the past year. There's more variable out there that some are -- many of them outside of our control.",
            "Very confident with our guidance, things are really moving well, but to take a chance to change the guidance at this stage, we have still quarter three and four ahead of us. So, we kind of figure we're in the guidance and that's what we decide to continue with our past communication. And we're not the type as you know that change guidance from quarter-to-quarter. So it's a bit -- we just wanted to be cautious and maybe Beth more detail to add to that?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Luc Desjardins"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Just as a little bit more context around it, we're pleased with the second quarter, but it is a lower quarter from a contribution perspective overall for the year as you'd be aware. So if you think of our range of $475 million to $515 million, it's roughly $20 million on each side of the midpoint.",
            "So again, to put Q2 in context, it was higher by $8 million versus 2019 modestly higher than potentially our expectations, but that would still have us within the lower end of the range if you want to look at it in the magnitude of the Q2 outperform. And again, as you flagged being cautious from a COVID-19 perspective, we didn't necessarily see as much impact of propane as we initially would have expected, but we're seeing more headwinds on the chemical side.",
            "So from that perspective, as we look at it going forward for the year from a cautious perspective and not knowing exactly what is going to happen we were comfortable with the low end of the range."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Well, we'll stay tuned and I'm sure you'll beat your guidance by the end of the year. Second question. On Canadian Propane margins the build-out of -- there's a lot of build-out over the export capacity in Western Canada of course. And the Western Canadian market could tighten. Do you think there's a chance here that it could drive the basis differentials between Edmonton and Conway? So I guess ultimately what is your forecast on sort of the Canadian margins? It was a good -- great quarter from a margin perspective, but what should we anticipate there?"

         "Speaker": "David Newman"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. And over 90% of our propane comes from natural gas. So there is a high level of confidence that there won't be a tight market out there that we will have and that's how it could supply in the fall. And then when it comes to the difference in price in -- for our wholesale business and for our retail, I'll ask Beth to answer that."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Luc Desjardins"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. And we're referring to the Edmonton-Conway spread. Towards the end of the quarter, we did see it moving more towards the five-year averages, where it has been more robust for the first part of the year or the first half of the year. So, overall, when we were looking at the second quarter, the second quarter -- those differentials were lower than you would have seen in 2019. So we would expect them towards the remainder of the year to come back more in line with that -- with the five-year average.",
            "And fundamentally if you want to think about that being lower than we would have seen in Q2 at the beginning -- the beginning of Q2 and in Q1, it reflects the fact that the Western Canadian market right now is quite healthy from an inventory perspective and domestic demand also has seen some pressures from the reduction in the oil field activity. So, again, our expectation would be more so the five-year average differential."

      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And similar in the U.S. propane prices have recovered from the lows, I guess, earlier in the quarter to some degree. And you've had very effective margins on the back of that. Any forecast like this is a very lofty number again. So on the U.S. side, should we be modeling a little bit lower than what you had in the quarter?"

      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. We would expect the low propane prices did allow us to pick up some incremental margin from some of the customer base. We are expecting with the commodity prices recovering and being a little higher for that ability for the remainder of the year to be narrower. So, yes, it's the long way of answering. You're correct if you want to think of the U.S., bringing it back more in line when you look at the whole year to the margin which is at $0.25 to $0.30 or CAD0.34 to CAD0.41 is the more reasonable range to look at for the whole year and similar in Canada over at--."

      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Excellent. And last one for me. Chlor-alkali has been weighed down by caustic rolling over and then the downward slope in hydrochloric acid which doesn't seem to stop. So, taken together as sodium chlorate where the volume I'm not sure if the volumes are coming back up to some of the outages but what does the second half look like for Specialty Chemicals overall?"

      },
      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I could start and Beth I'm sure you have additional points to make. So, we did adjust our forecast to be a bit lower in the chemical for the next six months. Price of caustic was going up for second quarter and now it went down.",
            "On the chlorate, we have enough -- our sales for this year are all planned. So, we're in good shape there. A bit lower chlorate volume because one of our big customers has a big outage in their plant and they have to repair the plant and probably won't be back until the following year next year 2021.",
            "So, it's kind of a little bit less on chlorate because of that particular customer. Now, we're trying hard to place it on export. We have some good export business a lot of connections around the world. Sometimes last minute so it could be hard to place. But the -- and then for next year, we have about 25% left of our chlorate contract to fill up our plans for next year.",
            "So, that's -- when you think we're in obvious, that's kind of reasonable even not so bad at all from next year prediction. So, now chlor-alkali I guess is the area that's more difficult to predict. No doubt on chlorate. It's a very solid sustainable business and we do export. But this year with COVID all the offices are not using a lot of paper. And we're only--"

            "So, net-net we did reduce our forecast to be cautious for ERCO for the rest of the year. We really think ERCO when you look at 10 years or 20 years, it's pretty much at the bottom of the cycle right now.",
            "I'd like to stay there under the year or so. But we're looking at different angles to get ERCO back to more growth in the future we'll see. So, Beth I'd like you to answer the--"

            "And it's happening to -- it's helping. What's happening is we kind of didn't go hard at acquisition until Brookfield came in.

            "And do they have to do some repairs on the line and probably stay open. No, we don't take those top -- we don't know how it takes going to happen and a couple of weeks of hiccup could come back again. That's a good point. And it could be in the way that they're retired.",
            "So, if you look at the two events that happened recently with the propane that had the difficulty from rail to move to the East to Quebec maritime. We were, for a few weeks, the only company in the East of Canada that could service our customer probably. And the reason for that is we're really scale. We were in Canada and on the East Coast of USA then we have our wholesale business in California, that's pretty big.",
            "So, when an event like that happens, our professional people in Calgary, who works for them, they're like tweaking stuff every day from a logistic. And what happened last year with the -- it was two breaks, one on them being the rail we started to move propane to the East Coast of USA, moved it north from the East Coast.",
            "That's how we can service our customer in Quebec maritime. So that's always on our mind as to what's the plan A, B, C? What are the events? Where do you buy cheaper and ship it to what location we have? There's 25 people doing that every hour of the day. So, hopefully we can continue to find solution, because of our scale or size for storage and our wholesale business.",
            "But hopefully, there's never a big crisis where everybody runs out. I don't think that can happen, because it's really -- for the people in the Chicago region or Quebec, we were talking about, whether all the commercial business getting in with that. So, don't think it will ever be that kind of crisis. But certainly something we look at and we look at other solutions if this was to happen.",

            "I mean I think the reality is, as we approach the business, we're always focused on security supply for our internal business or our retail propane as well as the wholesale customers that we have. So, we do try to diversify supply. We certainly are focused as a business to ensure that we have rail yards, et cetera. We're making some investments in transloaders to try to ensure that we have other options, if disruptions occur. Certainly, Line 5 would be a very large disruption. But having seen that, we have really focused all of our talented people in that business to try to come up with strategies and ways to address, if we do have further disruptions from that perspective."

Can you help us bridge you -- in U.S. Propane in the second quarter, you had about $14 million more margin in that business or $0.08 a liter. Can you help bridge how much of that was from FX? Was from good cost managers and synergies? Maybe help bridge how you got the $14 million and $0.08 a liter? Thanks."

So, if you want to think about it from the impact on margin, looking at margins, specifically in the low commodity environment, think about as roughly $0.02. From a foreign exchange perspective, think of it as roughly $0.01. And then, we do have a change in the mix as well, as we focus on the higher-margin residential customers compared to some of the other commercial customers. So that mix impact would have been roughly in that range of 4%."

So think of it as being a modest impact from an FX perspective. It will impact the EBITDA from operations, but a total overall adjusted EBITDA basis because of the hedging. It's a much more muted impact."
