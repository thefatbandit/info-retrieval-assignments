         "Thanks Dig.",
         "I won't spend too much time on opinion, because Dig's already touched on it. I think there were three main call outs that I would like to point your direction to. The things we're really happy with are the - we've maintained a gross margin more or less where it was a year ago, and that's despite the drop in volumes we had towards the end of the year, particularly as we went to one shift or so in the last month. I think that's a good achievement as we went over to get the recoveries from overhead when we reduce that volume, so we're happy with that in the gross margin, and that's only because of the good work around the warranty, which we've seen over the last few years, which we've spoken about in previous results.",
         "Dig mentioned, our costs have managed to fall and we made a deliberate effort in the last few months to pull that back. That's despite two-thirds of our cost - being staff costs. And you can see that reduction there, which is highlighted 8% down in sales and marketing and so forth, but it's mainly the discretionary spend. And I think that's important to highlight that we did pull back on that, but we\u2019re still able to invest in areas, which are important, as Dig mentioned all staff are still in a business, because that's the case of our success going forward.",
         "I think the other important thing to call out is that all the AMF costs now have now been recognized in the P&L, and that's at the bottom there. That's the net amount after tax. It's about - is about AUD500 million gross and the difference in the tax rate, the reason why that's not a straight 30% is because not all the amount was tax deductible. Some of the original payment was not deductible. So that's the reason for the less than 30% between the AUD500 million gross and the AUD416 million that you see on our P&L.",
         "In terms of the other income, we'll touch on that in a sec. The other income and expenses on the next slide, and the FX contract losses. They're only up until March this year. Last year, we had AUD0.67 versus AUD0.75 for contracts, which is why the amount is greater than a year ago, because a year ago, our rate was around AUD0.72, close to contracts at the time. So there's only about nine months\u2019 worth of FX contract losses there, and we\u2019ll touched on those in a sec. It's important to note too that the investments in the Innovation Fund have continued to go well, which you can see at the bottom there as well.",
         "In terms of the other expenses, because it was important to us to call these out, more for transparency, but just to help you with going forward and looking on with any modeling. These are more non-recurring in nature. And you can see there, we did benefit from the government assistance, particularly in the U.S. with the CARES Act, which happened in May, which the Trump Administration introduced and we\u2019re a big beneficiary of that.",
         "And as Dig has outlined in previous announcements, we did claim JobKeeper which started out with a big reduction in income in April. And if it wasn\u2019t for that, a number of our people in manufacturing actually wouldn't benefit from the JobKeeper amount, which was passed through to them when we went back to one shift. So I think that was an important program.",
         "So last year of the cycle release and - so that\u2019s - that one won't be there going forward. And as I mentioned before, we brought forward all the foreign exchange contracts up to April, because they were ineffective, because we could see the reduction in income going forward.",
         "And there wouldn't be any use for those contracts, so that's why you can see them there, which has been extended this year. Plus we had the non-cash write down for Carina and the Otoconsult which was the FOX investment a couple of years ago. And there is some more information of that in our results, which you can read on.",
         "In terms of the, our cash flow, normally, this is my favorite slide, and it's still is, I think if you back out the impacts of the AMF litigation halfway, a bit further up before 2020, and you add to that to the operating cash flow of AUD157 million negative, you get a number of AUD263 million positive, which is more or less, the underlying cash flow and compare that to a year ago, it's only about AUD33 million less than a year ago. So in the scheme of things, I think that's pretty good given we have COVID.",
         "And if you're looking at the reason for the underlying cash been so much greater than the underlying P&L of AUD153 million, the main reasons - main contributing factors to that are the non-cash items that I mentioned before on the previous page like, the Carina and the Otoconsult write-downs and some doubtful debt provisions, which were all non-cash, plus the impact of the good collections in receivables. So that's the main reason for the improvement over the underlying P&L.",
         "The other thing to point out there is the taxes are a little bit less than last year and I'll touch on that in a sec, with our tax refund that we're expecting to receive next year in the first half. The CapEx has gone up with the finish of the China manufacturing facility, which actually finished last week and the fit out of the Denver office over in - which happened this year as well.",
         "We've already touched on the acquisition of the intangibles and the Nyxoah investment as well in the first half and. The payment of the lease liabilities at the bottom, that's the principal portion of the leased under the new accounting standards.",
         "In terms of our net debt and financial position, you can see here this had impacted - it's almost up AUD600 million previous compared to last year. The AMF case you might ask the question, we see all these cash and why we got that AMF loan there. In the February results, you would recall that we actually had a U.S. dollar facility in place, in case we lost the AMF case, which we did and that was a good decision, we had that U.S. dollar facility there.",
         "At the time of the capital raise, the dollar was pretty volatile, it was around AUD0.57. If we paid that out in Australian dollars compared to now, it would have cost us about another AUD100 million. We actually step about amount in early June and that the rate had improved a little bit, but even compared to today, if we paid in Australian dollars, it would be another AUD50 million.",
         "So I think it was a wise decision to take that facility out in U.S. dollars and we're in no rush to really pay that off and we now have the benefit of that with the U.S. dollar at around AUD0.70. We've been buying some of that, so we will slowly start paying that down over the next few months, using the combination of our U.S. receipts, and what we have available there on the balance sheet. It's also - because we did cancel those FX contracts, which I mentioned on the previous page, we have a natural hedge there in the next six months with that loan.",
         "So it's a good way to manage that FX exposure as well. In terms, so if you're looking at how we've actually used our capital raise at the end of the day, it's really - a bit over AUD1 billion that we rose, less the AMF payment, it's almost the amount you see there in our net debt position at the end of the year.",
         "And finally, in terms of the capital employed, as I mentioned before, back in March when COVID hit, I was really happy with the way the business responded around the world to how we're managing our cash.",
         "We really rallied the troupes to be focused on not only receivables, which you can see there, and that's not only just a function of reduction in sales, but it's a good result of a focus by the - everyone around the world in chasing debtors, and a good control over our payout - over our discretionary spend and you can see the result of that pull back in the last quarter, when our credit is actually felt and normally, you would expect that to go up in a growing business.",
         "We're not too worried about the inventory going up. That was an insurance policy at the time, we didn't know what would happen. And we didn't know what would happen with borders around the world, so we kept the manufacturing plant going all the way up on two shifts up until late May or so. And that built up the inventory levels as a safety buffer around the world in case there were any border closures or we even had a COVID case in a manufacturing plant here.",
         "So, we will now bring those back to historical levels going forward, but we're not too worried about that inventory jump there, it was a one-off, and it was a good insurance policy to have. You can see the other improved - other net impacts of the capital and CapEx and so forth underneath.",
         "As I mentioned before, we're expecting a tax rate refund next year, which is part of the change in the other net liabilities at the bottom, netted off with the amount for the AMS pre judgment interest, which we announced yesterday with the ASX release. So if you grab our balance sheet, and you see the improvement in our net assets from that AUD675 million or so, that's mainly the combination of the AUD115 million you see there and the previous page of AUD560 million.",
         "Back over to you, Dig. I'll let you talk about the dividend."

      "Dig Howitt": [
         "Good morning everybody and thank you for joining Cochlear F '20 Results Presentation. So I'm going to give a bit of an overview with some highlights of the results then hand over to Brent, who we will talk through some of the financial data and will come back to me to wrap up on strategy and outlook and then move on to Q&A.",
         "Okay, let's go. So I just with our mission this time around and our mission has always been important for us, but I think never more so than in the last few months, when we had to navigate COVID-19 and it's really, I think helped us keep our people focused on our customers and focused on building awareness and what can we do to strengthen our product portfolio year-on-year.",
         "Just to jump inside your overlook, had a look at the results by now saying that we had $238 million loss on the back of the patent litigation and the reduction in sales coming from COVID-19. You can see that obviously COVID-19 is pretty hard in the second half with our second half sales down 22% Cochlear Implant units down, the services was down, acoustics was down, and I'll get into the detail of some of that in a few minutes. And our underlying profit was AUD 154 million when you back out to the AMF litigation and profit from our investments.",
         "I think just a minute of the patent litigation. I think it's important as you saw yesterday, that we've reached agreement interest in costs. We have reserved our right for a Supreme Court appeal and really this just wraps this issue up and we can put it behind us and move forward.",
         "You'd be obviously well aware of the capital raising we did through the year and that's really strengthened our balance sheet, given the enormous uncertainty that we face back in March and I think to a large degree, we still face. But that strength in our balance sheet enables us to continue to invest both in market leadership and retaining and driving growth and we'll talk about those things over the next little while as well.",
         "We have seen since the March recovery in the surgeries and that's positive; however, there is still a long way to go. And we'll talk a bit about the uncertainty that comes with that. Given that uncertainty, we will not be providing guidance for F21. And we\u2019re also suspending our dividend until we see trading conditions improving and improve on a sustainable basis.",
         "If we just look back now over the year, we did in the first half, had a very strong start and that continued through the mid-March. We were clearly gaining share particularly on the back of the Nucleus profile Series implant. And I think we continue to say that we have gained share as surgeries have recovered over the last few months. As emerging markets sustained very strong first half benefiting from the significant investments we've been making over the last few years, but emerging markets have also been significantly impacted at a slightly different times to develop markets. We'll talk a bit about that.",
         "As we've talked about before, COVID-19 was a significant impact - very significant decline in elective surgeries in April, started to see a little bit of recovery in May and are pleasingly in the three larger markets; China, in the U.S. and Germany we still see some good recovery through June, albeit, remembering that this recovery includes catch up surgeries as well and we'll talk a little bit more about that as we go forward. And Services and Acoustics, which we'll also talk about, have been materially affected by clinic closures and priority being put to new cochlear implants surgeries over Services and Acoustic surgeries.",
         "As we went into the pandemic, as we saw COVID-19 expand across the world, we were very clear that we want to be able to continue to invest and continue to build our market position and our market growth activities. We have received approval for seven important new products that really does strengthen our product portfolio and I\u2019ll talk a little bit about that in the outlook section.",
         "But, let's say, we would - as we came into this year, it was very important that we regain market share through developed markets and we have done that and with the strength of the portfolio now, what we've seen in the last few months, we think there is more opportunity for us to strengthen our competitive positioning and gain some share as we move forward.",
         "We've also had to evolve and adapt our awareness programs, both the direct-to-consumer and the hearing aid channel to make those programs much more virtual. We have done that and we've also taken the opportunity with significant time in clinics and in the hearing aid channel and many places with surgeries to be able to do quite a bit of training around our products, around the direction we're taking, and we hope that that - we know that is strengthen our relationships, we hope that also continues to help us to set us up for the future.",
         "We\u2019ve provided a quite detailed guidance in our release on costs. And really what I want to say here is, that we did reduce non-essential spending, we reduced CapEx, as we saw COVID-19 hit and we did that through Q4.",
         "However, we're also very clear that our strength comes from our people, and therefore we wanted to make sure that we retain our people, so that we can continue to have strong customer relationships to drive growth, and to drive our R&D portfolio and with people making up two-thirds of our operating costs, that obviously puts a limit on the extent to which we can pay cost back. And we very strongly believe it's the right decision to retain our people and continue to invest, because there is a genuine opportunity for us to continue though the crisis to strengthen our market position.",
         "Now, I've got - just got to run through each of the segments and just draw attention to some of the insight that we're getting in each of these segments. Starting with cochlear implants. So I said we're gaining share in cochlear implants in developed markets. We think our product portfolio and our presence with our clinics and with candidates over the last few months has helped us to continue to gain share. You can see in the chat, a very significant beginning in the second half on our sales.",
         "And as we\u2019re seeing some recovery, which is very pleasing and as I said in the U.S., Germany, good recovery, Benelux, Australia are also going quite well. We are seeing variability between clinics and very significant variability between countries. So there is still quite a way to go before we would confidently say that the surgery market has recovered, and we're back where we were. We're certainly not in that stage.",
         "And emerging markets had a very strong first half, up 20%. We managed through our China shutdown for surgeries from late January. Did recover quite quickly and we see good growth in China over the last few months, which is pleasing and we have been investing in China over the last few years. And we have across other emerging markets; the outlook is not nearly as strong India and Latin America still have significant numbers of COVID-19 cases and low surgery rates. And we also have a number of our emerging markets that are heavily reliant on oil revenue for the health of their economies and with the oil price down that poses some risk across some other small markets.",
         "Moving onto Services, in Services, the outlook of Services over the longer run is very strong. We have a strong product portfolio, we have a growing base. The introduction and acceptance of connectivity, Cochlear Link, Remote Check, Remote programming; all provide good reasons for people to upgrade to clinics to encourage people to upgrade to latest technology, which is connected.",
         "However, in the short run, we do expect to see and we are seeing limits in clinic capacity strips, creating upgrades. So longer run, the outlook looks good; shorter run a bit tougher and we can see that here in the second half with services reasonably affected by the clinic closures.",
         "Onto Acoustics, and Acoustics, again, we reported at the first half that we've lost some share and there was deferral because of anticipation of OSIA 2, we launched on OSIA 2 in February, just before in the U.S., just before in March when things started to shut down. We are seeing a very, very positive feedback from OSIA 2, and very good providing surgeries from OSIA 2 in the U.S., and we definitely believe, as we said before, I have - that the OSIA 2 System is a very important addition to our portfolio for the Acoustic segment. However, it will take us some time to get the regulatory approvals and to get appropriate reimbursement across a range of markets.",
         "From the Baha perspective, we've seen some recovery in surgeries, particularly in the U.S. However, in the U.K., Acoustic implants are still - surgeries are still not happening and the U.K. is the second largest market for Acoustic implants. So, while the U.K. doesn't do surgeries, we expect to see a continued impact on our Acoustic revenue.",
         "So with that, I\u2019m going to hand over to Brent to talk about some of the results in detail, and I will come back with our outlook.",
         "Thanks Brent.",
         "Yes, just to cover off from the dividend, as we've said, we won't - we've not done - final dividend and we will continue to look for sustained improvement in trading conditions and cash flow before the board resumes dividend. Okay, so have a look at the outlook.",
         "So first of all, our strategy is unchanged. We've had to debt how we've implemented some of our strategy and as you'd expect in the changing market with the core is unchanged. We do want to retain market leadership, and I think with the strength of our product portfolio, the strength of our field teams around the world and their presence, particularly over the last three months, we are in a strong position.",
         "We know we have to drive growth as the market leader and very clear that we have to invest in awareness, in access, in the evidence to support expanding access for hearing implants for people right around the world. And we aim over the longer run to deliver consistent revenue and earnings growth. Obviously, this year has challenged that.",
         "But the important point for us now is really through F21, is to really be focusing on those first two: our market leadership and growing market - growing the market, and I need to get back to where we were and then to be driving growth from there, particularly as we go into F22.",
         "So our product portfolio is very, very - clearly leads our competitors and one of the reasons that we lead is because not only do we have terrific benefits for our customers, but we do that across the portfolio. So we've launched our - 15 months ago now, the Profile Plus implants. It is clearly the benchmark in size and reliability and with a range of electrode options, and we're seeing that help support our market share.",
         "The Slim Modiolar Electrode now has been in the market for a few years and its increasingly good data showing consistency of placement, showing improvements in hearing outcomes, and we do believe that the future lies in getting electrodes closer and closer to the auditory nerve and therefore, being out to deliver better hearing outcomes.",
         "The Sound Processor is a very important part of the portfolio and there we lead in terms of size, in terms of connectivity and hearing performance and hearing performance driven particularly by our signal processing algorithms, which ForwardFocus and Smartsound iQ are very important parts.",
         "So it's a very strong portfolio, and that portfolio has been strengthened this year with seven important product approvals and we said at eight months ago, in February '19 in our result then that we had a strong product pipeline and R&D and what you're seeing here is the results of some of those products in that pipeline getting approval and coming to market.",
         "So the Osia 2 system, I've talked about very, very strong reception from both patients and surgeons in the U.S. over the last few months. The Slim 20 Electrode electro - wall electrode is rolling out now into a good reception. And in Kanso 2 to Nucleus 7 means that both the BTE and off-the-ear processes have full range of connectivity and that's connectivity both with iPhones now and now with Android phones and that connectivity is an enabler of Connected care.",
         "So our Remote Check solution, which is approved this year rolling out around the world, all of that goes towards making care easier and simpler and more convenient for our customers, also keeping clinics well connected with their patients and from a payers' perspective, these connected care solutions have the ability to lower the overall cost of care by reducing the number of face-to-face appointments, which both frees up capacity for growth, but lowest the cost of lifetime care as well.",
         "And we're also adding clinical and surgical tools for audiologists and surgeons, into make their jobs easier with Nucleus Smart now, I think able to provide the surgeon with more information on the electrode insertion and we can see that there is a clear link between the electrode insertion and hearing outcomes.",
         "So we want to be our strengths in terms of retaining market leadership is that we are able to advance the whole portfolio across all the areas of portfolio, so that all of our customers are able to see gains and benefits and that really builds our relative competitive position being able to move all of the aspects of the technology forward.",
         "We did execute, as Brent said, on important CapEx projects in the year and those projects have run very close to schedule and that's I think a good achievement given the impact of COVID-19. So the new office in Denver is now open, people moving in and as Brent said, the factory in China has been handed over to us just a week or so ago and we're now in the install equipment and commissioning phase, leading into regulatory approval over the next few years. So it's been important to execute those significant capital projects well over the last year.",
         "If we now look to the outlook, and it's obviously more complicated and more difficult to give an outlook statement than novel and that's why we're not providing guidance. We do think that there remains significant uncertainty in terms of what our revenue will be through F21 and as I said earlier, what we're then trying to do is to use this year to really strengthen our competitive position and to invest in our growth programs.",
         "So we will continue to invest in R&D, we very clearly have a strong portfolio, we continue to invest and we continue to have a strong pipeline of products and services coming through that pipeline.",
         "We will also continue to invest in awareness and referral channels in developed markets. We know that in developed markets, that's the major barrier. There are significant numbers of people with hearing loss and meets the indication for our - indications for our products, but the awareness is still low, and the referral channels are not clear and consistent. So investing in both of those things will continue.",
         "In emerging markets, to build awareness and our presence, so we continue to expand our presence in emerging markets through F20 and we will continue to do that in selected markets into F21 and beyond because we know that building pretty big on the ground, building relationships, driving awareness and in governments on board with supporting implants for children is very, very important part of our growth.",
         "In terms of the recoveries boards, CI Surgery, in June and July, we did see that developed market, Cochlear implant units were broadly in line with where we were last year and that we've seen good growth in China. It's important to note there that particularly for the developed markets, that's a result of clinics reopening, but it's also a result of some catch-up surgeries, so surgeries that were deferred through April and May, many of those surgeries occurred in June and July, which is part of the recovery, as all and the other thing we're seeing and getting strong indications from clinics of - is that we are gaining some market share, which is part of that recovery being in line with where we were 12 months ago.",
         "We're monitoring the mix of surgeries by age. That's very important as we said in March, we expected that surgeries for children would proceed relatively quickly. But we were uncertain for adults and seniors what we have seen broadly across the developed markets that have opened more quickly is that surgery mix is largely in line with where it was, not quite, but largely, so we're seeing significant numbers of adults and seniors coming through to get surgery.",
         "There is very, very clearly uncertainty around the second wave of infections and we've just seen elective surgery deferred in Victoria. There are clearly a number of U.S. states with surgeries - sorry, where infections are rising and also through Western Europe, we're also seeing gaining some resurgent across a few cities and a few areas. It's just very uncertain to know what impact that will have, but we do not expect that there will just be a nice linear recovery we expected and there's some variability in the rate of recovery of surgery.",
         "And I think as many others have been saying, we're now five months into COVID-19. There is still a long way to go before we out of here and before I think we can have a good level of predictability over the future.",
         "Emerging markets, as said we've seen China recover very strongly, but outside of China, surgeries have been very low and particularly, look at Latin America and at India, they're still seeing increases in the number of cases and much lower level of surgeries than we would normally see in those markets, and it's just too early to know what the outlook - what the future holds there and what the outlook will be like.",
         "I think very important aspect across all markets, but particularly developed markets is what does the new candidate pipeline look like, remembering that for most people who are getting Cochlear implant surgery in adult and senior, and over our senior, there's a 9 to 12 months process of referrals and assessment, leading up to surgery. So surgeries that we saw in June and July, are people who are well down in the pipeline, when COVID hit in March. So we're five months on from that.",
         "So those people are all already halfway through the pipeline before COVID hit and what we're watching very closely and it's too early to make a call on yet is just what's happening with the new entrants into the pipeline through our DTC programs, we're obviously monitoring that, but it's just too early to know, and what we do know is that clinic capacity is lower than it used to be, largely it's because of sensible conservatism around social distancing, around appointment times and scheduling.",
         "So we won't know for another few months really what that pipeline looks like. We are using our direct-to-consumer activities and we've adapted those as we've said to try to rebuild the pipeline, to work very much underline lead generation and virtual interactions with candidates to try to understand their intention to educate them around our products.",
         "But it will still be a few months before we know how that, what that pipeline looks like. From services, as I said earlier, we think over the long term, there is - there continues to be very significant opportunity in services. Kanso 2 with all its connectivity, I think is a very important addition to the portfolio.",
         "The recipient base price, remote tools, make upgrading even more attractive than normal. However, there is reduced clinic capacity right now, which makes it more difficult to predict just what will happen with services over the near term and we did see in June, July about services running about 70% of the rate they were 12 months before.",
         "Acoustics, similarly running at about 70%, reasonably good recovery in the U.S. through June and into July, particularly for our Osia 2, which is growing very strongly, and as I said getting very good feedback. But also, as we said earlier, the U.K. is not doing Acoustic implant surgeries, and has a significant market that will clearly have an impact on Acoustics performance.",
         "We've got some detailed guidance in the release on our costs and how we expect to manage costs over the next 12 months and we do have a very strong liquidity position and that puts us in a position where we can continue to invest sensibly in building our market position and in driving growth.",
         "Going back to what we said in March as we want to merge from COVID-19 in a stronger competitive position and really executing on our growth programs, and that's where we're focusing our expenditure, cash flow of about breakeven. And as I said now we won't provide earnings guidance until there is more certainty and similarly the dividend will be suspended until we see a sustained improvement in our sales and cash flow and that we see that, that improvement will be sustained into the future.",
         "So with that, we will now go onto Q&A. Just as we move to Q&A, and if have both a teleconference going and a webcast, maybe a few second delay between the two. So just as you're asking questions, be aware that there could be a delay and may have to turn off the telecast to avoid feedback through the teleconference."

            "It's good to hear that volumes are starting to recover. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the recovery in key markets, pretty clear between pediatrics and adults. And could you mention the backlog and catch-up, is it safe to say that pediatrics are pretty much on quota and it's just adults that are in backlog and how is the adults fairing in the United States, Germany and Australia?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, thanks Lyanne, good questions. And let's yes, the pediatrics have been prioritized just about everywhere and from best we can tell through developed markets, that the reason to backlog of pediatrics. We think for adults, certainly the backlog is also largely caught up. And that's part of the driver for the strong numbers in June and July.",

We're not quite back to 25%-75%. But we're not too far away.",

I will say what we're going to watch, we are watching closely for now is adults and seniors entering the pipeline, and people who have just gone through a few months at home with a significant hearing loss and coming out of that saying, I'm actually more worried about other aspects of my health, or now I really do want to get something done about hearing loss.",

I'm not sure whether we started to interpret that half proportion literally, but how do we interpret that, if I have to say the delta between the sharp decline we saw in early April back towards the kind of flattish number in developed markets in June, July, around half of that was the backlog, is that the intention of the comment?"

In terms of opportunity to get leverage, I mean we just - we want to get back - first off, we want to get the revenue back to the level we had sort back in February and then grow from there, because our cost base is largely set around the revenue that we did have. We have obviously reduced discretionary spending, I mean, out - travel and sort of conference expenses are of a reasonably significant cost for us, that's going to be close to zero. And I think it will be a while before they come back.",

At this stage, we are aiming to get back to where we were, albeit, this uncertainty on how long that will take.",

And - but a bit - I think the way to look at that is so as people become eligible for an upgrade, they now have a choice.",

W is quite possible, as we said earlier, don't think it's going to be linear, just because I think what we're all seeing is that it's pretty easy for infections to spread and that puts and get back - puts pressure on hospitals, it leads to restrictions on what people can do and how they can move around, all of that's going to have not only an impact on scheduled surgeries, but it's probably going to have an impact on the pipeline.",

I mean, given that the majority of the cases are pediatric, I'm assuming that plenty of these kids being born still, are they just not presenting to the hospitals or are you just saying you're concerned because the hospital systems are overwhelmed with the number of COVID cases and if that diminishes sort to advance back as quickly as it has done in some of the major markets?"

The hospitals can be overwhelmed, that reduces capacity and remembering in most of these markets, there's no so routine screening, so that to - the diagnosis typically depends on the parents recognizing that there is something unusual about their child, their child is not responding to sound.",

So I think it's certainly a more - it's a bigger issue than just the hospitals are overwhelmed that as soon as they get on top of it, it will all be okay, again.",
