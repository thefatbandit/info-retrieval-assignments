         "Slide 15. Thank you, Harry, and good afternoon, everyone I\u2019ll provide a brief overview of our financial results and also invite you to review our earnings release and our 10-Q for a more detailed description.",
         "In today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll describe our sequential quarterly financial performance focusing on our first and second quarters of 2020, while we also include year-over-year performance in our disclosures. We believe this sequential conversion is currently more meaningful since the 2020 financial performance, illustrates Progenity\u2019s transition to a largely in-network operation and reflects the impact of the COVID pandemic, which obviously was not a factor in 2019.",
         "Slide 16. Starting with revenue. We reported consolidated revenue of $17.3 million in the second quarter, compared to $16.8 million in the first quarter. We should note that our first quarter 2020 revenue includes a $13.2 million settlement accrual and our second quarter revenue includes a $10.3 million provision for refunds. Without the accruals for Q1 and for Q2, our test revenues were relatively stable in the second quarter, matching quite closely our volume profile during the quarter \u2013 during the period.",
         "This gives us confidence that our revenue should experience sequential quarterly growth during the second half of 2020, assuming volume demand continues to progress. This is even more important as our in-network transition efforts are ongoing and are expected to be a positive contributor to revenue through the second half of this year and into 2021. This provides upside potential going forward, as we expect to gradually see the benefits of that transition materialized through higher percentage of test paid and broader access to in-network patients.",
         "Slide 17. I\u2019ve been explained the revenue progression between the first or second quarter of 2020. We cannot explain the evolution of our ASP between the periods, while our first and second quarter\u2019s ASP was unusually low due to accruals that reduced revenue. Our second quarter ASP also reflects two main contributing factors. The first factor relates to the resilience of our NIPT volume demand during the quarter leading to a higher proportion of NIPT tests in our total volume compared to the first quarter.",
         "The average reimbursement rate for NIPT tends to be slightly lowering for carrier screening and as a result, our portfolio ASP reflects that temporary shift during the second quarter. On a long-term basis, we believe our NIPT to carrier screening ratio should normalize to 1.2:1, our typical ratio as we\u2019ve previously disclosed.",
         "The second factor influencing our ASPs are ongoing in-network transition, where lower average rates have not yet been fully compensated by an expected higher percentage of test paid and increased in-network volume numbers. Our second quarter 2020 cost of sales were lower than in the first quarter, largely the result of slightly lower volumes and lower supplies and logistics costs.",
         "Our SG&A expense of $29.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 was lower than in the first quarter, largely the results of savings due to the COVID work from home policies and lower travel and commission expenses. The savings were partially offset by an increase in our stock-based compensation expense following our IPO in the second quarter of 2020.",
         "R&D expense was $12.2 million in the second quarter of 2020, marginally higher than in the first quarter, due to an increase in our stock-based compensation expenses following our IPO. We expect our R&D expense to increase slightly in the second half as our different programs progress to expected key milestones and de-risking steps.",
         "Our net loss in the second quarter of 2020 was $53.1 million, compared to a net loss of $17.2 million in the first quarter. The variance relates to the negative accruals against revenues in both the first and second quarters, and the $37.7 million income tax benefit related to the CARES Act, which was recognized in full during the first quarter.",
         "Our second quarter 2020 operating clash cash flow was negative $13.5 million, compared to a negative $30.9 million in the first quarter. The variance is largely attributable to the receipt of $22.7 million of income tax refund in June related to the CARES Act. We expect to receive the remaining $15 million in the fall.",
         "Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter of 2020 was $113.6 million representing a substantial increase compared to the first quarter explained by the receipt of $22.7 million income tax recovery and $88.7 million in net proceeds from our IPO.",
         "At the end of the second quarter of 2020, we had $78.9 million in indebtedness, the majority of which relate to our $75 million secure debt facility, which matures in October of 2022. We believe our balance sheet gives us the runway to achieve critical value creating milestones in 2020 from our R&D pipeline and to show continued progression of our molecular testing business. While we are a net cash [indiscernible] operating company, we proactively manage our capital structure and one of our stated goals is to be thoughtful in managing our capital stack and the forms of capital we secure in the future and we intend to execute on that strategy.",
         "With that, I will now turn the call back over to Harry."

         "Moving to Slide 3. Thank you, Robert, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. We are pleased to be with you on our first investor call as a public company. At Progenity, our mission is to combine a cutting-edge diagnostic testing business with innovation into precision medicine and reality. We focus on diagnostics across the women\u2019s healthcare spectrum, including NIPT, and carrier testing. We\u2019re also developing a preeclampsia rule-out tests based on our proteomics platform and advanced in the development of our non-sequencing platform with Innatal 4 NIPT at the first targeted application.",
         "We believe growth of our core business and our innovation will support our goal to be the leader in the women\u2019s health reproductive health market. In parallel, we\u2019re also developing orally administered technologies to deliver what we expect to be first-in-class GI focus therapeutics and diagnostics to provide true GI Precision Medicine. Later in today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll provide an update on our innovation pipeline, but I\u2019d like to start by reviewing some of our Q2 corporate highlights.",
         "Slide 4, despite the pandemic, the second quarter was productive time for Progenity. We settled the previously disclosed investigations with the government and received a total of the $122.7 million in funding from our IPO gross proceeds, and through provisions of the CARES Act. Operationally, we showed resilience in sales in the face of COVID-19, may progress with payors and our affiliate lab Avero Diagnostics, added SARS CoV-2 testing to their molecular infectious disease, and to support our southeastern regional customers. We continue to advance our in-network transition and compliance efforts and expect to see the benefits from these in the coming quarters. Meanwhile, we continue to advance our pipeline of both women\u2019s health and GI Precision Medicine products.",
         "Slide 5. Let\u2019s begin by reviewing our current molecular testing business. As we illustrate on this graph, the Progenity has a strong history of volume growth, and we believe our commercial organization is well positioned to build on that track record. As a reminder, our entire volume and revenues are essentially derived from our OB/GYN and MFM channel. We must recognize that the COVID pandemic influence demand dynamics and starting in March growth slowed and certain R&D projects were also adversely impacted. We aggressively adapted to the new conditions and achieved Q2 volumes at 95% of those in Q1 and ended Q2 on an upward trajectory. We view this as a strong performance under challenging circumstances.",
         "Slide 6. Looking our Q2 quarterly volume in more detail. Our business began to stabilize in May, while June ended the quarter with higher volumes than the start of the quarter. Strengthened bar enhanced digital sales capabilities and additional remote patient support. Our NIPT demand was most resilient, which helps support a carrier screening volume. We anticipated \u2013 we anticipate accelerating sequential quarterly volume growth through year-end. COVID-19 testing began to make initial volume contributions in Q2. As pregnant women represent a high-risk COVID-19 group, we are evaluating opportunities to expand this launch more broadly in the second half of this year.",
         "Slide 7. Now, let\u2019s move to our progress within network payors and compliance. We had the 34 million covered lives in the first half of 2020, including signing in-network contracts with Aetna in January and Cigna in June. We are now predominantly an in-network company with approximately 144 million lives covered nationally. In addition, our affiliate lab of various diagnostics is already broadly in-network with commercial payors in its target markets. This in-network status is an important transition for Progenity. As we see material future upside from the expected increase in percentage of tests paid, improved ASPs and increased access to a much larger in network patient base.",
         "We have initiated an expansion of our sales force to maximize this opportunity and expect this hiring will have a positive effect on volume growth in Q4 of this year and beyond. We believe combination of growing in-network position and progressive sales force expansion will further increase our competitive advantage in the OB/GYN MFM channel and will help maximize our ability to market our plan preeclampsia rule-out test. One of the benefits that we capture from our in-network status was endless decision in April to cover NIPT for average risk women through the end of 2020, due to the COVID pandemic, while temporary measure, we are cautiously optimistic that payors, physicians and studies will continue to support this trend and it may become a longer-term change across all payors. In that event Progenity, as an example, would have realized approximately $10 million more in revenue during the second quarter, based on our pricing and volume.",
         "We view the quality of our relationship with payors as an important aspect of our future success. And Progenity has successfully concluded constructive agreements with private and government payors over the last year. As part of our work to improve our compliance program, including an internal auditing and monitoring functions, we commissioned the third-party review of our coding and billing processes. In connection with that audit, we identified that we had not appropriately transitioned the implementation of the new billing requirements for larger carrier screening panels, which were introduced in early 2019.",
         "As a result over the last 18 months, we received an overpayment of approximately $10.3 million from government payors during 2019 and early 2020. And this is reflected as a chart in our second quarter financials. We anticipate that a portion of the CARES Act tax refund expected this fall will be used to satisfy some of our obligations to government payors this year. We intend to continue to apply rigorous compliance processes going forward.",
         "Slide 8. Now, turning to the part of the business that especially excites me, R&D pipeline. Slide 9. Let\u2019s begin within Innatal 4, our next generation NIPT tests. NIPT is expected to be the first application based on our novel, single-molecule counting platform. I am pleased to say in July, we achieved the key development milestone that enables us to measure fetal fraction. This is a novel non-sequencing, non-polymorphism based method.",
         "We are confident that Innatal 4 will have degenerate that rivals sequencing, but at a lower COGS and with much faster turnaround times. The single molecule platform, we also have the potential to quantify a range of analyte, including DNA, RNA, epigenomics, and proteins, and it\u2019s expected to have compelling advantages in liquid biopsy or a range of diseases, including cancer. We anticipate sharing further key advancement regarding our Innatal 4 product this year or in Q1 next year.",
         "Slide 10. Now, let\u2019s move to the development of our preeclampsia rule-out tests. As we presented before there is significant unmet need for a preeclampsia test, which represents a $3 billion opportunity in U.S. along with a large global market. Our test is a proprietary multi-analyte platform with biomarkers that are involved across multiple pathophysiological drivers of preeclampsia, not merely angiogenesis. It is designed to a position to rule out preeclampsia in symptomatic patients, which allows them to pursue the best clinical management plan. How it goes to improve patient outcomes or lower the cost burden of preeclampsia to the health system.",
         "Slide 11. Initially, we are developing a laboratory developed tests or LDT or preeclampsia, as well as planning the development of an in vitro diagnostic or IVD version of the test. In early Q1, we announced a successful completion of optimization for our LDT with strong performance and a cohort of over 800 patients.",
         "I am pleased to say our operations group has initiated analytical verification for the preeclampsia LDT with the commercial platform. We expect to complete analytical verification in Q4 with over 400 patients. We also anticipate completing validation with samples from over 1,600 patients by mid-year 2021. With a targeted commercial launch plan for the second half of 2021, we recently filed a pre-submission with the FDA for the IVD version of the test and have secured a meeting in October.",
         "Slide 12. Turning now to the development of our GI Precision Medicine platform. We expect this will be a transformative platform for GI research diagnostics and therapeutics. Let me begin with our biopharmaceutical and therapeutic platform. The goal of delivering biopharmaceuticals orally to achieve effective systemic distribution, long being considered significant clinical unmet need. I am pleased to say that last week we entered into our first collaboration with a major pharma company for a clinical stage asset for this platform.",
         "The asset is technically challenging, but high reward and the collaboration is structured in stages. Consequently, it has the important, the potential for being expanded in the future based on the program\u2019s results. We also have grown in interests from other pharma, one of which commissioned a third-party consultancy to undertake due diligence that resulted in positive feedback and concluded that we have a promising first-in-class and versatile platform. Any of us can target the small intestine, autonomously releasing biopharmaceuticals and solution to achieve systemic distribution.",
         "We believe this technology has the potential to transform the way many proteins and peptides are delivered systemically compared to traditional IV and subcutaneous administration. Our lead internal candidate is an oral version of adalimumab, which will be supported by an emerging pipeline. We showed in early studies a bioavailability of 27% of IV for adalimumab in swine via the oral route.",
         "This is exceptional performance. We own to replicate or exceed that with our autonomous device by the adalimumab and other proteins. During the second quarter, we completed a prototype of a fully functional autonomous device, the oral biotherapeutic delivery system, or OBDS or short. This program is advancing towards preclinical studies with the first PK data readout expected in Q1 2021. We believe that pharma interests in the OBDS will only escalate as we generate more data.",
         "The second program within our therapeutic platform is a pipeline of investigational product device combinations that are designed to treat disease such as inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer at a site from the GI tract. Proof-of-concept studies with animal models and colitis to show that we can achieve high concentrations in the affected tissues or the potential to drive efficacy and minimize systemic exposure and toxicity.",
         "Our targeted therapeutics pipeline includes GI targeted solution based formulations of adalimumab and tofacitinib. Its candidate is planned to leverage our targeted drug delivery system or DDS capsule in an effort to deliver therapeutics to the site of disease in the GI tract and incorporate drug formulations, designed to improve stability and uptake in the GI tract.",
         "During the second quarter of 2020, we received written feedback from the FDA and response to our pre-IND dossier, which now guides our development activities. In Q4, we expect to use a DDS to initiate a clinical study in normal healthy volunteers, where we intend to demonstrate targeting of the ileocecal junction and delivery of a radiopharmaceutical detectable by gamma scintigraphy. This program is also attracting interest from pharma.",
         "On the therapeutics manufacturing plant front, we completed GMP scale up of our adalimumab that met the required parameters for similarity and quality, and also produced adalimumab API to support our development programs to completion of the first human clinical trials for both OBDS and DDS.",
         "I will now switch gears to highlight our progress on the diagnostic side of our GI Precision Medicine program. The first is the recoverable sampling system or RSS and in just a little capsule design to predominantly [ph] target a specific site in the GI tract and take two samples that are preserved and then can be extracted and aligned in the lab using a broad range of analytical platforms. The RSS could offer a simple, relatively non-invasive, yet powerful tool to help characterize gut biology, complex diseases, and patient response to therapy. We anticipate initiation of our clinical proof-of-concept study in healthy volunteers in Q4 2020. We also believe that data generated by this technology will prove both unique and valuable to us and we\u2019ll support partnerships with both biopharma and leading academia.",
         "A second GI Precision Medicine diagnostics program is the PIL Dx diagnostic capsule that has been designed to analyze using fluorescence in situ samples from specific locations of the GI tract. We intend to show that once ingested by the patient, the PIL Dx, autonomously samples, analyzes and communicate the results wirelessly to wherever receive a womb by the patient. Basically, it\u2019s an ingestible digital lab in a capsule that does not require recovery. I\u2019ll go as to build a broad menu of the rest and assays for GI diseases. Our most advanced PIL Dx program is a test designed to measure the concentration of live bacteria in the duodenum, the over abundance of which is a sign of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or SIBO.",
         "In the U.S., there are over 105 million annual patient visits for symptoms like SIBO and a projected $36 billion U.S. market. We believe this technology is successful in receiving a de novo pathway approval. The PIL Dx has the potential to become the standard of care for diagnosing SIBO. We expect to initiate preclinical studies for this technology later this year, and the first clinical proof-of-concept study in the second half of 2021.",
         "Slide 14. During the first half of the year, we presented five posters supporting the clinical utility of our products and services at the SMFM and ACMG conferences and published a manuscript in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, describing the design and reporting considerations for genetic screening tests.",
         "Shifting to the GI Precision Medicine side of our business. I am honored to report there are two abstract submissions to the American College of Gastroenterology Conference in October has been accepted for virtual presentation at the meeting.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric d\u2019Esparbes for a discussion of our financial results for the second quarter of 2020.",
         "Thank you, Eric. As we look at the rest of 2020 into 2021 and beyond, we see many drivers of value creation and revenue generation at Progenity. We believe, we will continue to experience resilience and return to sequential quarterly growth in our existing business over the coming quarters, driven by the differentiation of our products and services and by recognizing the benefits of increased in-network coverage.",
         "We are particularly excited with the progress and potential of our R&D pipeline. From now to December, we expect to launch new product line extensions and to achieve significant milestones in several of these R&D programs.",
         "In 2021, we expect to meet development and launch milestones in our preeclampsia Innatal 4 programs. We expect that progress for that precision medicine platform will continue to gain momentum and we anticipate further significant partnerships, both the immediate term and near future for Progenity is bright.",
         "With that operator, we are now ready for questions."

The majority of our business is inpatient visits. Now, of course, we\u2019re still virtual. So, we have to do the detailed support remotely in the majority of cases, probably about 20% is direct and it fluctuates. But that should give you a good view.",

And in the manner that I\u2019ve \u2013 we indicated in the script, it has a lot of potential and that point alone may lead to additional drugs being considered as we go forward. So look, interest is growing and you should watch this space and we\u2019re quite excited given how frankly, the technology is still proven itself and it\u2019s come a very long way. It\u2019s ready for use effectively. The interest we\u2019re getting in generating is I\u2019ll use the word exciting. Okay."

We expect that we don\u2019t give any guidance obviously, but I\u2019ve used the term accelerating sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re anticipating on \u2013 as we move forward. So, the trend is continuing."

So, it\u2019s like a little bit lower in Q1 and Q2. So, can you talk about more ability to intuit the ASP for the year end and then maybe, in 2021 as well?"

But effectively, we expect a rising ASP and the drivers for that is primarily due to our in-network transition and we\u2019re seeing a high percentage of tests getting paid. So, you should expect to see a rising ASP especially between now and Q4 and then into 2021."

So, I think like, do you expect there were more contrast to come, like similar to the one that you just signed? And then maybe, just a little bit like a spotlight on that. And then also \u2013 and then another question separate from the GI, it\u2019s on really the sales force\u2019s function like any specific areas that you target to hire more people, like for example, on the preeclampsia side or just on the NIPT part of it? Thank you."

            "Great questions. I\u2019ll do the last one first and then finish on the GI. So, during the road show, we indicated that we\u2019re going to grow our sales organization from about 150 to over 200 \u2013 around 200 in the next 18 months, the primary drivers are \u2013 we\u2019ve actually relatively got a smaller sales force than our larger competitors. So that\u2019s an opportunity for us, but really, the principal catalyst for the investment in growth is the fact that we\u2019re now in network and we have access to a broader customer base than we did before and also we\u2019re positioning for preeclampsia in the second half of next year. So, expect to see those that hiring to continue and it will make a difference. And I think you\u2019ll begin to see the difference \u2013 the early part of the difference in Q4.",
            "Okay. Now, hopefully that answers your question about sales force expansion. And it\u2019s national really. So, it\u2019s enabling us to go into areas that we\u2019ve underserved and the access customers that we were not able to access and enables us to tie in our territories. So, to enable even [indiscernible] that\u2019s the strategy. So, we\u2019re excited about the opportunity that in-network presents and preeclampsia dose.",
            "now, going beyond that to GI, yes, there is a pipeline of GI opportunities. Frankly, across the programs there\u2019s a special interest in the OBDS and in the RSS, and these include, so we tied the OBDS, where we\u2019re in advanced discussions, the clinical candidates are not some of which actually commercial candidates, others of which are in clinical development. So, it\u2019s really across the spectrum of what I\u2019ll call the pharma value chain and it ranges with different kinds of drugs. I\u2019m not going to get into details, but you can imagine monoclonals are an example of one. And also challenging products, where pharma has run into challenges and getting what they need from their capabilities. And they\u2019re looking for \u2013 they\u2019re looking for assistance from our technology and capabilities. So expect to see deals over time, and expect to see an acceleration of those deals as we go into 2021 and as we further \u2013 as we generate further data on the technology."

Two, the deal \u2013 it\u2019s a high potential drug and \u2013 in the clinic, and it\u2019s a challenging chemical class and where basically prevailing our capabilities on this one class and the deal is structured in phases. Phase 1 is where we mutually demonstrate whether or not we can make a difference together. Okay. You could imagine they\u2019ve explored many other approaches. Okay. And if that goes well, then there\u2019s an opportunity to then extend into a full agreement. Okay. We have other opportunities, where basically it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll give you an example at a very high level commercially strange product, where we\u2019re in discussions to provide additional shots on goal for the partner, okay \u2013 the prospective partner.",

But if you look at the trend lines, the shift is noticeable, but not overly material, but weren\u2019t highlighted, because the shift is a very good representation to the dynamics of the market and it\u2019s important to highlight, because the demand profile for NIPT and carrier screening are not exactly the same and I think we have very effective marketing strategies to make sure that they\u2019re continuing to perform well.

And now, I\u2019m really pleased to say that we\u2019ve transitioned the program into operations, which is the part of the business that\u2019s viewed as essential and it\u2019s taking samples as well as clinical samples, and that\u2019s where the verification and the validation is ultimately going to occur. So, whilst that doesn\u2019t guarantee it been insulated from COVID developments in the future 100%, it really gives an incredible protection relative to where we were before."
