         "Sure. Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everybody. We tried to make the numbers and the explanations in our press release and MD&A fulsome this quarter. So rather than repeat some of the numbers and commentary, I'd like to share some observations on the results in light of the pandemic and some discussions on values and liquidity of the business.",
         "So first on the quarter, we felt that the FFO per unit of $0.38 ended up relatively in line with pre-COVID results and not too far from our internal expectations. So we estimate that the net COVID-related impact was about $0.02 in the second quarter. The two main items that reduced FFO in the second quarter was a result of a loss of about $1.1 million in transient or daily parking and $1.5 million of provisions against our accounts receivable balance on June 30 to account for the expected 25% abatement from the CECRA program. That's about half the balance, and the other half is a reserve for the possibility that not all tenants may be able to repay certain deferral and outstanding balances in the future. We also qualified for approximately $1.2 million in wage subsidy programs during the quarter that offset a portion of the loss. We are hopeful that stage 3 reopens in Toronto. And as we get back to work, we will gradually receive more traffic in our parking garages, and we are not concerned that this will become a long period of loss in income. In the meantime, we are happy to donate these spots to first responders and volunteers at the hospitals to support the community.",
         "Our overall collection stats during the quarter have been fairly stable. If we include the cash collected to date plus the CECRA receivable and deferral arrangements that have been formalized, we are about over 95% for the quarter. We are making good dialogue with a significant portion of the outstanding rents and, in some instances, have already made verbal agreements for repayment. In addition, on the cumulative deferrals and outstanding rents, we are currently sitting on over $1 million of deposits, which we can settle what's needed. Last week, it was announced that the CECRA program will be extended to August. And we're happy to continue our participation to help our tenants recover through the pandemic.",
         "On a year-over-year basis, our FFO is down $0.06 per unit versus the second quarter of 2019. In addition to the estimated $0.02 of loss due to COVID, most of the decrease was attributed to net impact of asset sales in Montreal, Ottawa, North York and London, Ontario. That reduced our leverage from 45% to 38%, but we are left with a much higher quality and resilient portfolio that we believe will drive better performance and a safer business over time, with or without COVID. We reported net asset value per unit of $27.61 on June 30, which is about 1.8% higher than the first quarter. Our downtown Toronto portfolio increased $20 million, supported by independent appraisals that were engaged during the quarter on five of our properties. We remain comfortable with a weighted average cap rate of about 4.8% for IFRS valuations on our downtown Toronto portfolio, and that's flat quarter-over-quarter. The increases were attributed to higher in-place NOI and higher rents on leases we have signed.",
         "During the COVID period between March to July, we still managed to complete about 20 deals at an average net rent of about $37.41 or that is over 40% above expiry. Our leasing pipeline continues to grow. We are currently working on over 400,000 square feet of new leases and renewals at pre-COVID rates. We are also encouraged that the leasing first has been picking up over the past two weeks and will continue to do so now that work restrictions are easing. Given the unique circumstances that we are in and the unpredictability on the recovery of the pandemic, we have been very focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity to address any near-term operational challenges. So we have $214 million of liquidity and $240 million of unencumbered assets as of June 30 that are unpledged and not subject to any restrictive covenants on our company. Over the past few months, we have deferred $10 million of projects in 2020. And then in 2021, we deferred another $14 million. These deferrals will not impact any income or value in our properties in the future.",
         "Our two redevelopment projects at 357 Bay in downtown Toronto and 1900 Sherwood in Regina are both still on track to be completed on time and on budget. We expect to start collecting rent at 357 Bay in November of this year and for 1900 Sherwood in the second half of 2021. We are still committed to completing the financial district Dream collection on Bay by the spring of 2021. We believe these buildings will be exceptionally well-positioned during the post-COVID world, with centralized [ph] location, smaller floor plates, low-rise stories and modernized elevator and HVAC systems. We only have one mortgage renewing in 2020 with a balance of about $15 million on one asset with a carrying value of about $467 million. We are currently reviewing our options on refinancing. We think the rate and the term will be attractive given the quality and the location of the asset and our strong relationship with various lenders.",
         "So, all of the above give us confidence that our company is safe, our assets will remain valuable for the long term. As long as our share price continues to trade at a material discount to net asset value and we are comfortable in our liquidity, we will continue to opportunistically repurchase units in the marketplace.",
         "I'll turn it back to Michael now. Thank you."
      ],
      "Michael Cooper": [
         "Thank you very much. I'd like to welcome everybody for taking the time to attend our call. I'm very pleased to be here in person with Jay Jiang and Gord Wadley. And Jay and I will make some comments, and then Jay, Gord and I are happy to answer questions afterwards.",
         "We are in the office. Our office is opening officially on Monday. We'll have about 25% of our employees coming to the office regularly starting then, and we're pleased to be making these steps to get back to a little bit more of normal. It's been 144 days since all our offices were shut down, which is a lot longer than we expected. I would say just as a personal note, I probably spent four to five hours a day reading as much as I can to try to understand what's going on, and I really feel as if so, much of the information we've been getting is inaccurate. There's so many opinions that aren't based on fact, just chatter. So on this call, I'm going to try to avoid adding to that dissidence and just try to stick to facts.",
         "Our buildings are very well-occupied. The tenants are paying rent. We have a lot of renewals happening. We have new leasing. We've had a tremendous improvement in showings over the last six to eight weeks. And I would say, generally, for our business, we're probably basically looking at our long-term plans, and about 95% of what we've been planning are still in place. And we're looking maybe at -- we've been deferring some capital expenditures that we don't think are time sensitive. But notwithstanding how everything is different than we expected, our team has done an incredible job staying close to the tenants, supporting the tenants, getting the buildings ready, taking care of each other and putting our business in great shape.",
         "So Jay's got some details. But generally, I think that we're doing better than we could have ever imagined given what's happened. And as we look forward, we think that having sold 140-something buildings to get down to 32, having over 85% of our capital in downtown Toronto in boutique, luxury boutique buildings, I think we're incredibly well-positioned having low level of debt compared to where we were is very opportunistic. And although everything around us is in turmoil, we're just trying to manage through it as steadily as we can because we kind of set our course from 2016 to last year, and we're sticking with what we got. So that's basically where we're at.",
         "Jay, do you want to deal with the quarter?",
         "Thank you, Jay. And as I mentioned earlier, Jay, Gord and I would be happy to answer your questions now."

Can you maybe expand -- or maybe some -- if Gord, on what you're hearing from tenants as far as their plans for getting back into the office and their needs going forward and maybe if this differs between your smaller and larger tenants?"

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Of course. So good morning, everyone, and thanks for the question, Mark. So effectively, our goal throughout this whole pandemic has been to overcommunicate and frankly, try to overprepare all of our assets to be ready to receive our tenants. So what we did was we provided micro strategies on our website for each one of our buildings showcasing new way finding markers, egress access, different things to help our clients feel more comfortable. Throughout our buildings, we implemented a number of COVID-specific technologies. As Jay mentioned, a lot of our buildings are low-rise buildings. Some of our bigger buildings with lots more elevators and escalators, we installed UV handrails for the escalators that clean constantly. For our larger high-rise buildings, we've implemented UV technology and air filters in the elevators. We have foggers that we're doing in all the common areas. We've installed microbial shields in all high-touch areas and medical-grade and increased cleaning throughout the portfolio. So all of this is outlined.",
            "And as a component of talking to our tenants about a lot of the government programs, we also spoke to every single one about what we're doing within the building so that they feel more comfortable. I think unanimously, almost every tenant in the portfolio has reached out to our client services team. This is a dedicated team that fields all requests on operations and as a conduit to provide information to everybody. So we've had great engagement and collaboration with our tenants. A lot of our tenants are already back, Mark, not at full capacities. Usually, throughout, we see about 25% to 30%. And we're starting to see a lot more people coming back to the office. And it's bringing a lot of optimism as well."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Great. Moving into a different direction. As far as the IFRS NAV, you had a little bit of an increase this quarter. And it seems over the past couple of years or so that your IFRS values have probably been lagging the moves in property values. Do you feel that right now there's -- you can have confidence in what the real value is and that this is reflective of where cap rates are? Or is it just too little that actually is trading or that will trade in downtown Toronto for your types of properties to have confidence in that value now? And maybe just a second part to that question, you bought back some units this year. I think to the most part, at lower prices, your view on buying back units at current levels."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Mark Rothschild"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Great questions. Firstly, you use confidence twice in the first part, of which we have very little. So other than that, I could have answered the question. What I can tell you is building on Peter Street recently traded at a 7-year lease. It traded at sub-3% because it has development potential. But even with the development, it traded at higher prices than what we're carrying things at. When Niagara traded, I think, it was at $620 a foot. And again, these are all in the last month, and that building has to be renovated. So we are seeing a limited number of transactions, and the transactions are all at very high prices. But again, those are limited. I think that we've got our assets. I think we've got Adelaide Place and 30 Adelaide based at a 4.5 cap, and I think those are on relatively conservative rents. Everything else in downtown Toronto is at 5, and I think we feel that those are reasonable assessments. Having said that, to be blunt about it, we asked the appraisers what they think and we do what they say. So we have our own opinions on real estate. We don't have our own opinions on what the appraiser's A market value is.",
            "So our numbers are what the numbers are, but I think that they're reasonable. So no, I don't have a high degree of confidence about values, but everything that we do see, including comparative sales plus recent leases support the values we have. With regards to buybacks, to be blunt about it, we're looking at relative value. And at $20, buying some stock back, we think, is very attractive, and we'll continue to look at opportunities to enhance the value of the company. And right now, I think putting off some CapEx is not necessary to buy back some stock as a great trade."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Just a little bit to add. We typically praise about 25% to 30% of our portfolio every single year. So over a 4-, 5-year cycle, you probably capture everything. Last year, we did around 40-something percent. This year, we picked five properties. It's a good piece of our portfolio. So it's a pretty rigorous process in terms of IFRS valuation. We follow the methodology. We book the values that it comes out. But none of the inputs have really changed, it's just the higher-in-place income."

I think you're 50% tenant retention so far for the first half of 2020, and interestingly, higher in Q2. So maybe firstly, just based on where your leasing pipeline is, what do you think retention heads in the back half of this year?"

We've got about 18 renewals for about 260,000 square feet in the pipeline that we think is generally 70% or greater probability of getting completed for the bulk of them. Surprisingly, we've had good success on some renewals and some unbudgeted renewals out West in Saskatchewan on one of our assets there. And in Toronto as well, we have a few renewals that we're working on actively right now. We have seven new deals that are in the pipeline that are 75% greater probability of completing as well for about 42,000 square feet. And one thing I do have a tremendous amount of optimism in is over the course of the last four weeks, we've received six RFPs nationally, four of them are out West, and they constitute about 140,000 square feet. So early days on those RFPs, but it is showing some velocity, and it's showing some people that are starting to plan going forward for their accommodations."

That's a net new deal for us for a full floor in one of our buildings. What we're seeing on Bay Street collection is we're seeing demand for tenants, smaller tech-type tenants that are looking for smaller floor plays, 3,000 to 5,000 square feet, and they want the discretion and autonomy to have their own floor plate, which Bay Street collection can provide, so we're seeing that. The one other thing I'd say, which was interesting is about four weeks ago, we were seeing maybe two to three tours a week, one of them would be a virtual tour. And in the last two weeks, I've turned this to Michael yesterday, we've seen double digits in tour, so we had -- I think we had about 11 last week and this week, we're up to about 13. So there's been people that are starting to revisit the market."

Is this something that you're hearing more from tenants in terms of like during COVID that they've been demanding or inquiring about and wanting to be comfort on? And if so, are you seeing a need to invest more in the buildings than you had previously planned as a result of those desires?"

            "No. I think that's a great question. And we've had a number of people, especially on these RFPs and the new tours that are asking those questions, what's your circulation on the floor? What type of technologies do you have in terms of HVAC? What filters are using? Are you using MRF-13? Are you putting it into any UV-light technology? And it's been a great marketing tool for us. Like I said, we've really pushed over the last two months since we revisited our capital plan and reallocated some funds into COVID technologies. We've been using that as a marketing tool. It's been helpful. A lot of our sophisticated -- more sophisticated tenants that have facilities managers are well up to speed. We had a large tenant, Michael mentioned, the UV robots. We've got these autonomous UV units that go and circulate through all the common areas and kill 99% of the viruses. We had one of our facilities managers for a very large tenant of ours. We gave a training overview two days ago, and they were quite pleased with the direction on what we're doing and how we're trying to kind of future-proof and protect our buildings.",
            "But to your question, everybody unanimously is asking about air circulation, air quality, and we're very fortunate that we have a number of low-rise buildings where you can take the stairs, and the elevators are all new and being upgraded. But what I'm really pleased with, with the team and what they've been able to institute is our larger buildings, Adelaide Place, Bay Street is our elevator UV filtration, which has gotten great feedback from a lot of our clients and prospects."

      "20": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Why don't I start? Gord, you can chime in. First of all, on the quantum of the capital, for example, Base Street village, the elevators and the HVACs were already top of mind because the air quality was a focus for bringing the luxury boutique to top of class. So it was regards to the prior guidance we gave, we're not increasing the capital just because of that because it's already being done. A significant portion is actually recoverable just because we mentioned last year that the additional rents in a lot of these buildings were significantly below market comparables. So for example, on a per square foot basis, you would have about $6 to $7 that you can really amortize over time. We have communicated all of this to our tenants. They got the prebuilds in November, December. Most of were very excited about it, and they want to be a part of the new village. And these are amenities that will improve the tenant experience, so it works out for everybody."

You get a good sense of their conversation, especially when it comes to deferrals and CECRA. Now it's more art than science, but typically, we would have a watchlist of tenants that we may be concerned with based on the feedback that they give. I think, as a whole, though, it's really only about 1% that's really on the radar, but between the programs and the deferrals and the collaboration, really, our goal is to just get them through the pandemic."

            "Yes. So for June, really, I would say that for the second quarter, it was part of one conversation. So during the early innings of COVID in March and April, the tenant relations team would have conversations with the tenants about the whole quarter. So for example, at the time, we had no idea how long this pandemic was going to be and, frankly, I think it was a bit longer than most people anticipated. So we did say that April, May, most tenants were good to pay their rent. And we said that if it does drag on to June where it was going to start to shoot through some capital for some of our smaller tenants, we would support them through the deferral programs. Now keep in mind at the time the details of the CECRA program was also unclear, so it was a work in progress from May to June. We're encouraged with July, it's because a, some of the tenants are coming back now, so the traffic is increasing. That will also help with the parking. But really, we still don't know a lot of variables going forward on -- in terms of consumption and how -- if schools will start and people will be back in the office."

So some people walk or bike, but other people will be driving. So we're expecting that other tenants may be doing similar things and that parking revenue will increase."

It was announced last Tuesday or Wednesday saying that Phase 3 would be on a Friday, so I think it was going to increase some more. I think after Labor Day, it's going to increase some more. And quite honestly, I found the traffic to be increasing rapidly. The people in the street has been -- in some cases, I'm stunned by how many people are out. So I'm not sure I agree even downtown. To go a little bit further, when you look at our retail, some of it are big companies, and some of it are smaller companies that provide excellent services, and some are smaller companies that don't provide important things. But we do a lot of it as amenity space, so we're definitely going to work very closely with the restaurants that make our buildings better. And we'll work with them limping along because it's very difficult for them. But we've got a big chunk that are good covenants, a smaller chunk that are excellent amenities to our buildings, and we'll see if some of the other tenants if we can help them or how they do, but we'll see.

Retail income only makes about 6% of our portfolio income, and we saw an increase of COVID collections that was fairly substantial on the retail side. So we're constantly communicating with them. To Michael's point, a few of our larger retail tenants are great covenants, and we've got some independent operators that we're committed to trying to support and work together because we think they offer great amenities to our buildings, which make predominantly the biggest bulk of our income."

On the 400,000 square feet of leases under discussion or so and several of them are renewals, has there been any tangible sign of tenants either looking to expand or contract footprint or are they simply tenants looking to kind of get back into the space at this stage?

So a lot of the renewals that we're dealing with right now, you have to keep in mind that the vacancy rate in downtown Toronto is still, by any market measure, extremely tight. So I think a lot of the tenants want to preserve the space that they have. I think a lot of people are as committed to we are into making these buildings safe, so they see that we're making progress on our physical assets and how they operate. We haven't had, I'd say, for the most part, out of these renewals, say there's 12 that are 75% or greater. I'd say 10 of them are keeping their same footprint. I'd say it's a small minority that are looking at potentially downsizing and getting some creative terms. But for the most part, it's the status quo. I would say also, too, that our rental rate preservation has been strong. We haven't deviated from our net rent."

We're focused on getting our sites approved, and we'll decide when to start, but there's still time for all our development sites, but those approvals are coming along. Certainly, at Burnhamthorpe and Eglington is coming along. That's going to be a big approval, and so it takes some time. At 212 King, it's going to take a bit longer, but we're pretty excited about that building. So all that stuff is normal; Gord's debate is normal. The fact that there's so much energy going into both qualifying for government programs as well as collecting rent is a bit different. But I would say, when we sit down and talk about the company, the conversations are pretty much the same as it would have been a year ago, especially if you get over the next 12 to 18 months.

There's six landowners that include Choice, Kingsett, RioCan, smart centers, a private group and, ultimately, it's 100 acres. It should end up being something like 100,000 residential units. The city wants that to be approved. This city does what it does best, which is make it difficult. A couple of items were delayed from council two weeks ago. There's lots of negotiations going on, on the overall plan for the area. Generally, everybody is in agreement that it should be pretty dense developments. It's got where the new transportation is, so I think what we're really dealing with now is the official plan. And once we get that done, which could take another year, even maybe a year after that. So probably two years away from having approval. But sometimes when you deal with the city, a developer wants to do something different than what the city wants. In this case, the city wants to make this a new area that has all these new apartments.",

We always targeted close to 40% debt, give or take, a little bit. Our debt-to-EBITDA is pretty good. Interest coverage is good as well. So I think the balance sheet is good now, so there is some room. The main metric is really liquidity.

In the winter, we really stopped buying because the stock was in the low to mid-30s, so that's the 5%. We didn't expect that stock available at this price. We're happy to be buying more of the same buildings at discounts, but I don't think it's going to be dramatic like it was in the past. I think we're just picking away at the edges. I think we can buy it to 30,000 a day. Lots of days, we can't get it. We have a pretty firm limit on how much we're spending as a stock price, so we'll see what comes in.

So on a lot of the deals that we're working on right now, on the new deals, you are seeing a little bit more people looking for flexible terms. In terms of nonfinancial provisions, we're getting requests for midterm terminations. We're getting requests for potentially the right to downsize in three years on a five-year term. Just looking for more control or flexibility, these conversations are coming up, so good point there. But in terms of the rents, the rents are very much in line with what we were forecasting, where a lot of the new deals that we're negotiating now, if we're negotiating seven new deals for about 45,000 square feet, I'd say maybe two or three of those deals are looking for Q4 commencements for this year. And then the balance of the deals we're seeing kind of Q1 commencements for 2021. The bulk of those large RFPs that we're responding to, the 150,000 that are out in the market, those are a lot of 2022 commencement dates on some of them, one or two of them are Q3 of 2021. And then for the most part, on the renewals, to your point, some of the smaller tenants, we are seeing shorter-term renewals, about three years. It's just so that they can make in a combinations decision a little bit more in the near-term than traditionally. But for the most part, it's just people trying to leverage some nonfinancial provisions is what we're seeing."

I wouldn't say we're capitulating in all instances, but if -- in cases where the tenant is a good fit and we see some value and we see some growth, we will work with them, especially if we're seeing some new tenancies with good growth forecast. Jay and I review covenants all the time together. And if we see some tenants with good growth forecast, we'd be more inclined to provide an option to terminate or give them more flexible terms. So we have an -- so we have a 3-year or a shorter-term runway to really woo them, do a great job and have been growing our portfolio."

I think it might be a little difficult to go to a Board to sign a new lease today, so we want to encourage them.

In terms of going forward, now these program continues to evolve, and there is a lot of work that needs to be done in order to look at eligibility and amount. So it is uncertain right now, but I said we would have to close the books at the end of each month. So by September, October for Q3, we'll have a better idea then. But in general, what the government is trying to do is without the CRB, they're trying to use these wage subsidies to gradually float the businesses, which we think is a great idea.
