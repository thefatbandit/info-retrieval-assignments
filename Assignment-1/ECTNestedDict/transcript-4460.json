         "Thanks, Kevin, and hello to everyone on the call. As Kevin said, I was the CISO for 15 years, leading the transformation of IT risk and security programs at some of the largest companies in the world. And the playbook I used to do this always included one company every single time and that company was FireEye.",
         "So why is FireEye always been a key partner in my transformation playbook? It all starts with the foundation of what makes this company so special. Simply said, I believe then and I believe even more strongly now that we have the world\u2019s best cyber expertise and threat intelligence and that we know more about the bad guys than anyone in the industry.",
         "Our Intel is derived from an organization that\u2019s been operating for over 15 years, and the knowledge gained from responding to over 800 incidents a year. And that work is supported by 180 analysts operating in 22 countries and monitoring in over 30 languages.",
         "This Intel is an applied upstream into all FireEye products and solutions, from our endpoint cloud solutions, how we respond to incidents, how we hone for bad guys in your network, help build and manager stock and test the effectiveness of your security program through red teaming and automated validation. There\u2019s simply nothing else like FireEye\u2019s comprehensive set of cyber expertise, threat intelligence and products and that is why I joined FireEye.",
         "So looking ahead, given the unprecedented rise in frequency and sophistication of attacks, one of the areas I\u2019m most excited about is the security validation business. If there\u2019s one thing all companies need to be doing right now is to validate the effectiveness of their security programs. And that\u2019s exactly what Mandiant Validation is all about.",
         "We have taken the power of Verodin, which we acquired last year, and combined it with our global and breach intelligence to create a platform that helps companies answer two very simple questions. If I were attacked today, would they detect it? And how effectively could they respond to it?",
         "When someone reads a headline about a company being shutdown due to a ransomware attack, the first thing they ask themselves is that, could that happen to them? How ready are they for that? Companies want to know how effective their security program is, not hope it is effective, hoping is never a good strategy.",
         "And then also, given where we are in the COVID world, we\u2019re all looking at ways to take costs out of our respective organizations. Mandiant Validation not only tells you what\u2019s working or what\u2019s not working, it can also tell you what return you\u2019re getting on your security investments, giving you the data you need to make decisions about where you can effectively manage cost of ineffective security controls out of your organization.",
         "And we\u2019re finding that more and more companies want this insight, given the cost constraints faced by all companies in this COVID world. And there are a number of companies that do this, but none of them have the combined power of the Verodin platform backed by Mandiant Intelligence.",
         "So this is why I\u2019m here and excited to be part of this world-class team and help our customers combat this ever-evolving threat landscape.",
         "So thank you. And I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank."
      ],
      "Frank Verdecanna": [
         "Thanks, Brad, and hello to everyone on the call. Before we move on to the details of our Q2 results and the guidance for Q3 and the remainder of 2020, let me remind you that I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP metrics, except for revenue and operating cash flow.",
         "Our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debt, restructuring charges and other non-recurring items.",
         "As a high-level summary, Q2 was a really strong performance for us across all key metrics. I echo Kevin\u2019s comments that we executed extremely well in this uncertain environment. We delivered revenue of $15 million above the midpoint of our guidance range and reduced our operating costs by $17 million compared to Q2 of 2019.",
         "As a result, we delivered our highest ever non-GAAP operating profit of $22 million. We also delivered positive operating cash flow of nearly $15 million and free cash flow of $9 million.",
         "Now let\u2019s turn to the details. We remain focused on annualized recurring revenue and revenue as the most important indicators of our financial performance. ARR provides insight into the expansion of our installed base of reoccurring subscription without regard to short-term changes in average contract length, or timing of large renewals, which, as we\u2019ve seen, can cause volatility in the quarterly growth rates for billings.",
         "Revenue reflects growth in our deferred revenue balances and drives our profitability. For these reasons, we believe ARR and revenue are better indicators of the progress on our transformation journey, especially in the current environment.",
         "Some color on our Q2 billings performance illustrates this point. We delivered $203 million in billings during the quarter, down 8% from Q2 of 2019. The year-over-year decline was a result of three factors.",
         "First, in Q2 of 2019, we booked a large multi-year government appliance refresh and renewal deal that was entirely on-premise e-mail security. While this deal did not reach the $10 million threshold that we typically disclose, it was at the very upper-end of a $5 million to $10 million range. We did not book any transactions approaching this size in Q2 of 2020.",
         "Interestingly, when I look at the details of large deals in Q2 of 2020 compared to Q2 of 2019, the most significant difference was in deals greater than $3 million. We booked five deals greater than $3 million in Q2 of 2020, compared to nine in Q2 of 2019. I believe the decline is most likely related to the uncertainties of the current environment, as deals as large are typically multi-year and paid upfront.",
         "Second, the same trend is reflected in the decline in average contract length in Q2. Overall, ACL declined by about two months and had the effect of reducing reoccurring and total billings by about $12 million.",
         "Finally, recall that the appliance sales were relatively strong in Q2 of 2019, due to the refresh cycle associated with the End of Life of our X300 appliances. Product and related subscription billings were up 5% year-over-year in Q2 of 2019, led by a 24% year-over-year increase in appliance sales.",
         "This compare made the Q2 decline in product and related subscriptions category look much sharper than longer-term trend suggests. I\u2019m providing this detail, so you can see how factors that have little to do with our current operating performance can impact the uptick.",
         "Our sales have traditionally been weighted towards large enterprise and government customers. And this can drive big deals and make variation between quarters. However, our ARR metrics show that these long-term strategic customers rely on our products and solutions to protect their organizations as much as they always have.",
         "Looking at our revenue and ARR by breakout categories. Our shift to cloud-based and cloud-delivered solutions continued in Q2, with platform, cloud subscriptions and managed services revenue, up 30% year-over-year. This category accounted for 32% of total revenue, compared with 26% of total revenue in Q2 of 2019.",
         "Platform, cloud and Mandiant Services ARR increased 27% year-over-year and 5% sequentially and accounted for more than half of our ARR for the first time. Revenue associated with on-premise product and related subscription business was down 12% year-over-year. A large portion of the decline was associated with appliance hardware, as appliance sales from prior periods are fully amortized.",
         "ARR for the product and related subscription category continues to stabilize, with ARR down just 2% sequentially. This decline was more than offset by sequential increase in the ARR of the cloud version of our products.",
         "Professional services revenue was a record $53 million and accounted for 23% of total revenue, compared with 20% of total revenue in Q2 of 2019. Strong demand for our expertise and a higher mix of our incident response services allowed us to maintain high utilization rates and chargeability, which translated into record gross margin of 57% for services. Lower travel, which is charged back to customer at cost or 0% gross margin was also a factor.",
         "The increase in services gross margin helped drive our total gross margin to 72% consistent with Q2 of 2019 and above our guidance range of 68% to 69%. Operating expenses declined $17 million from Q2 of 2019, reflecting our reduced cost structure, following the first-half 2020 restructurings, as well as roughly $8 million to $10 million of lower travel and entertainment and lower facilities operating costs due to the worldwide shutdown related to COVID-19.",
         "The combination of higher than expected revenue, improved gross margin and lower costs translated into record operating income of $22 million and earnings per share of $0.09.",
         "Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $914 million. The cash balance reflects payment of a significant portion of the Q2 restructuring charge and the repurchase of $96 million of the $120 million in Series A\u2019s convertible notes. The total amount of convertible notes outstanding is now approximately $1.1 billion.",
         "We ended the quarter with $120 million receivables, a decrease of $20 million from the $140 million in ARR at the end of Q1. DSOs declined to our historical range at 54 days, a decrease of 20 days from the end of Q1 due to good billings linearity and collections of some of the outstanding receivables carried over from Q1.",
         "Our strong collection performance resulted in operating cash flow of $15 million and free cash flow of $9 million. Total deferred revenue at quarter-end was approximately $893 million, a decrease of $27 million sequentially and $20 million from the end of Q2 of 2019.",
         "Product and related deferred revenue decreased by almost $66 million from a year ago, as appliance sales and the related subscriptions and support from prior periods are fully amortized. The year-over-year decline in product and related deferred revenue was partially offset by a $20 million increase in platform, cloud and managed services deferred revenue.",
         "Note that deferred revenue associated with professional services projects declined about $3 million on a sequential basis from the near record levels of Q1. With increased capacity in our strategic consulting business from hiring over the last year, we were able to work through some of the backlog of committed projects.",
         "Our top line results validate the resilience of the business and the relevance of our strategy. While the improvement of our operating profit and cash flow demonstrates our resolve to transform our operating model and deliver profitable growth.",
         "Now, let\u2019s turn to our current outlook for Q3 and the second-half of the year. As we\u2019ve discussed before, changes in average contract length, the timing of large transactions and subsequent renewals, customer preference for on-premise versus cloud form factors and periodic billings, all have the potential to impact the quarter-by-quarter billings mix and growth rates. This is especially true in the current environment.",
         "As a result, we are not guiding to billings number for either Q3 or for the year. However, with more than 90% of our non-services revenue recognized from the balance sheet, we have good visibility into our revenue and operating model, and we are comfortable guiding to revenue, operating profit and earnings per share.",
         "I\u2019m pleased to say that with the continued momentum we are seeing early in the third quarter, as well as the strong revenue and operating results posted in Q2, we are raising our guidance for revenue, operating margin and earnings per share for the second-half of 2020 and the year.",
         "For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $225 million to $229 million, gross margin of between 70% and 71%, operating margin of between 7.5% and 8.5% and fully diluted earnings per share of between $0.06 and $0.08.",
         "For 2020, we are raising our revenue guidance range to $905 million to $925 million, an increase of $25 million at the midpoint from the previous guidance. We now expect gross margin of between 70.5% and 71.5%, compared to our prior period expectation of 69% to 70%. This range assumes our services gross margin returns to a more sustainable range of 52% to 53% in the second-half of the year.",
         "We are raising our operating margin guidance range to 6.5% to 7.5%, which reflects our increased revenue range and our reduced cost structure, as well as lower travel and facility operating costs as compared to 2019. Embedded in this guidance, our assumptions about the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating metrics that you should consider as you build your models.",
         "First, we do expect T&E and facilities operating costs to increase from the lows in Q2, as restrictions are lifted in certain international regions. As we outlined in our Q1 call, we expect the restructurings we did in the first-half to reduce our operating costs by about $25 million in 2020, compared to 2019, and this remains our expectation. We also expect to see a continued decline in the average contract length by about two months compared to a year ago.",
         "And finally, we remain somewhat cautious about the potential impact of the pandemic on services billings and revenue growth rates. More specifically, our current outlook does not anticipate a sequential increase in services revenue in Q3. Also, we do not expect to see the same surge in prepaid services billings we saw in Q4 of last year when services billings exceeded $70 million.",
         "As noted, this is based on what we know and believe as of today. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty that has been created because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But I believe we have proven the resilience of our business. We do \u2013 we are doing our best to provide you with guidance, while operating in this uncertain environment. But I\u2019m confident in our ability to deliver on improved revenue and profitability outlook as we continue to transform our business.",
         "Operator, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions."

         "Thank you, Joelle. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us today to discuss FireEye\u2019s financial results for the second quarter of 2020. This call is being broadcast live over the Internet and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of FireEye\u2019s website at investors.fireeye.com.",
         "With me on today\u2019s call are Kevin Mandia, FireEye\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; Frank Verdecanna, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer of FireEye; and Brad Maiorino, FireEye\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. After the market closed today, FireEye issued a press release announcing the results for the second quarter of 2020.",
         "Before we begin, let me remind you that FireEye\u2019s management will make forward-looking statements during the course of this call, including statements relating to FireEye\u2019s guidance and expectations for certain financial results and metrics; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; FireEye\u2019s priorities, initiatives, plans and investments; drivers and expectations for growth and business transformation; the expansion of FireEye\u2019s products, subscriptions and services; and the benefits, capabilities and availability of new and enhanced offerings; market opportunities; and go-to-market strategies.",
         "These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after the call.",
         "For a detailed description of the risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, as well as our earnings release posted an hour ago. Copies of these documents may be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. Additionally, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call.",
         "We have provided reconciliations on these non-GAAP financial measures for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the Investor Relations section of the website, as well as in the earnings release.",
         "Finally, I\u2019d like to point out that we have posted the supplemental slides and financial statements on the Investor Relations section of the website.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin."
      ],
      "Kevin Mandia": [
         "Thank you, Kate. I\u2019d like to thank all of you for joining us today, all the investors, the employees, the customers and the partners that have such a strong interest in FireEye. I hope all of you, your families and your loved ones are staying healthy during these unprecedented times.",
         "I\u2019m proud of how FireEye has responded to the current challenges the world is facing. We made the pivot to work from home in March. And as working from home continued over the months, we maintained productivity and we delivered the results we set out to accomplish in the second quarter.",
         "I\u2019m going to begin today\u2019s call by discussing some Q2 highlights. I\u2019ll provide an update on our innovation, both Mandiant Solutions and FireEye products. I will then turn the call over to Brad Maiorino, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. And then we will conclude our prepared remarks with the discussion of our financial results from Frank.",
         "We did what we said we\u2019d do in the second quarter. We exceeded our guidance range on both the top line metrics, as well as the bottom line. In fact, revenues in the second quarter were the highest second quarter revenues in our history and our non-GAAP operating income was the highest we have ever had as a company.",
         "So let me share some additional highlights. Q2 revenue was $230 million, $15 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our revenue growth was led by year-over-year increase of 30% in our platform, cloud subscription and managed services categories, which includes our validation, threat intelligence and managed defense offerings, as well as our cloud-based security products such as EPP and cloud endpoint. Annual recurring revenue for this category increased 27% year-over-year.",
         "I\u2019m very proud about the performance of the Mandiant Consulting services. Revenue for the service grew 21% compared to the second quarter of 2019. This marks the ninth quarter in a row of record revenue for our professional services, the sixth quarter of year-over-year revenue growth greater than 20% and the third quarter in a row that our services revenue exceeded $50 million.",
         "Our threat intelligence annual recurring revenue grew 27% year-over-year, reflecting just how differentiated our frontline knowledge and global threat intelligence really is. The composite of our revenue continued its shift from our appliance-based heritage and our control products to our cloud-based products and Mandiant Solutions.",
         "Combined revenue of our platform cloud category and our professional services category eclipsed our more mature appliance-based business again in the second quarter and accounted for 55% of our total revenue. This compares to 46% of our total revenue a year ago and 40% in the second quarter of 2018. So we have the evolution in the right direction.",
         "And another major milestone, our annual recurring revenue for platform, cloud and managed services surpassed the product and related category for the first time ever. We achieved these results while significantly reducing our cost structure, generating a non-GAAP operating margin of 10% and a record non-GAAP operating income, net income and earnings per share.",
         "We also added more than 200 new logo customers in the quarter and closed 39 transactions greater than $1 million. While both these metrics are down from slightly a \u2013 down slightly from a year ago, this performance is in line with expectations given the current environment.",
         "We first mentioned a year ago that we were seeing two related, but different areas of focus emerged within FireEye, which we referred to as platform and solutions business and a products business.",
         "Since then, we have optimized our investments, reorganized our development teams, and placed new leadership in each of these two areas. We also created two separate brands, FireEye products and Mandiant Solutions, to better reflect our internal structure. Doing so allows us to simplify our go-to-market strategies and to leverage the equity of each brand.",
         "FireEye products has control technologies to best protect our customers and Mandiant Solutions has a product agnostic offering to enable and empower all security technologies to be as effective as possible.",
         "Our innovation cycle fuels and enables both the FireEye products and Mandiant Solutions businesses, each relies on and constantly improves from our frontline experiences an incident response, performing Red Team engagements, and our global threat intelligence network.",
         "So now, I\u2019ll provide you an update on both these areas. I\u2019d like to begin our update with Mandiant Solutions, which consists of Mandiant Consulting, our threat intelligence, our managed defense and our security validation capabilities. And we\u2019ll start with consulting.",
         "As I said earlier, our services business had its ninth straight quarter of record revenues, an increase of more than 20% over the second quarter of 2019. We will continue to invest in consulting for at least three reasons.",
         "First, I believe our Mandiant Consulting services will continue to deliver above-market rate growth. This growth is driven by two predominant factors, a threat environment that remains elevated and our reputation as the recognized industry leader in incident response and cyber security consulting.",
         "The second reason we continue to invest in Mandiant Consulting is that, our services drive strong long-lasting customer relationships that lead to follow-on business. As an example, our incident response is often the tip of the spear for new logo customers, and more than 90% of our service customers purchase additional products or services within 12 months following our initial engagement.",
         "And third, our services deliver one of the highest contribution margins in the company. Therefore, we are creating new services and adding the capacity to deliver these services in order to continue the momentum of the Mandiant Consulting practice.",
         "Now, I\u2019d like to update you on the Mandiant Intelligence and Mandiant Validation. Customers and security operators routinely want to know everything we know about cyber threats, and they want to answer two questions. Are they currently compromised by these threats? Or could they be compromised by these threats?",
         "Therefore, under the leadership of Chris Key and Sandra Joyce, we have modernized the delivery of our threat intelligence and coupled it with our validation capability to address this need. We call combining both our threat intelligence and our security validation, the Mandiant Advantage, and we plan to make it available to our customers during this quarter.",
         "With the Mandiant Advantage, along with our proprietary threat intelligence, we will also be including related open source information, so that customers will be able to know what we know in real-time and apply that knowledge to their own security alerts coming from any source.",
         "In short, the Mandiant Advantage is like adding our threat intelligence team to our customer security operations with results at network speed. In addition, our customers will be able to seamlessly pivot from our threat intelligence to security validation. This will enable our customers to simply and safely execute real cyber attacks and hone their defenses based on the results of these attacks.",
         "We believe the simplicity, elegance and ease of the Mandiant Advantage is a major step in our transformation. And that will be instrumental in embedding our threat intelligence and validation capabilities into all security operations, whether they leverage FireEye control products or not.",
         "We are also expanding our Mandiant Managed Defense offering. Starting later this year, we plan to offer our managed defense capability with third-party endpoint technology for the first time. By offering managed defense without being exclusive to FireEye products, we expect to expand our addressable market and enable new technical partnerships and alliances.",
         "And now, I\u2019d like to provide you an update on our products business under the leadership of Bill Robbins. FireEye products leverage our frontline threat intelligence to provide the most up-to-date defense against cyber attacks. Protecting our customers from threats on the network and e-mail on the endpoint, and then the cloud remains a core part of our mission.",
         "Over the last three years, we have modernized our products business with new form factors, simplified our go-to-market and we have a greater focus on customer success. We also continue to enhance the products with new features to support our customers.",
         "Our endpoint annual recurring revenue increased more than 30% year-over-year, with cloud endpoint ARR, up more than 100% for the second consecutive quarter. The investments we have made have driven above-market growth, as well as industry recognition.",
         "For example, for endpoint, we achieved the highest cumulative detections across all categories, among the 21 evaluated vendors in the 2019 MITRE ATT&CK assessment. And most recently, we won recognition at the Best Endpoint Security in the 2020 SC Europe Awards.",
         "Our launch of Endpoint Security 5.0 in the second quarter was one of our best releases ever. A key to this release was our innovation architecture, which represents the shift to a more modular design that results in faster innovation in new detection, new protection and enterprise readiness features. We believe next-generation cloud endpoint, including managed EDR, continues to represent a growth opportunity for us and we are increasing our investment in our endpoint solution.",
         "We continue to innovate network security, raising the bar and detection leadership, while enabling customers to expand their deployments into public and private clouds. Our Network Security 9.0 release during the quarter included more than 40 customer requested features, including support for Microsoft\u2019s Azure and bring your own license options for both AWS and Azure.",
         "In May, we added new capabilities to Helix that further enhance the safety and security of remote workers. These and other product innovations are helping us deliver control technologies that better protect our customers with offerings available on-premise and in the cloud, that leverage our industry leading threat intelligence obtained on the frontlines.",
         "In conclusion, we continue to accelerate FireEye\u2019s transformation. Our Chief Operating Officer, Peter Bailey, is helping lead this transformation by focusing us on higher profitability and increased growth of our cloud category and ARR as our emerging key metric. We are also transforming our back office from our appliance-based heritage to a modern quote-to-cash process.",
         "We recently appointed Dave Baumgartner as our CIO to facilitate the changes required, and we are laser-focused on changing our processes to better support our subscription businesses and delivering our solutions in a more modern and simple way. I want to thank all FireEye employees for all the progress we have made toward our transformation and for their continued efforts and focus through these most unusual times.",
         "And now, I\u2019m about to turn the call over to Brad Maiorino, our new EVP. I\u2019ve known Brad for over a decade. And during that time, I got to watch him transforming the security operations of Target, Thomson Reuters, General Motors and General Electric. He uses specific methods to create and measure security programs and we have the means to improve upon and institutionalize these practices.",
         "So I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Brad, who is going to share his perspective on the industry and the reasons why he joined FireEye today. Over to you, Brad."

            "Yes. Really, the only impact from a services margin perspective, there were two components to it. The first component was a higher mix of incident response, which is at a higher rate per hour. So that obviously benefited the services gross margin. And then the fact that we\u2019re not doing a lot of on-site travel. And so, that helped, because we don\u2019t have a component of what we\u2019re charging at very low margin.",
            "So, when we get reimbursed for travel, that\u2019s basically at cost. So that does bring down the overall gross margin. I would expect that going forward, the new norm will probably continue to deliver a lot of stuff remotely, but there\u2019ll be occasions for on-site engagements as well."

I think a strong argument can be made that the ability to implement and enforce security controls is more relevant in the current environment than ever, which I think Brad was talking about as well. What I\u2019m wondering is, how much evangelism, if you will, is required today in order to help customers understand the value-add of that service?"

And first, it\u2019s \u2013 our sales force has warmed up to it. So you\u2019re going to see, in my opinion, pipelines increasing nicely, and I like that. We\u2019ve got the behavior amongst our entire sales force that it\u2019s a relevant service.",
            "The second thing, though, is it depends on the state and maturity of their customer. And what will happen is a lot of times, if you red team a customer and they have two years of remediation to do, they don\u2019t need to do continual red teaming. So this is something that there\u2019s almost like your red team somebody, they do the remediation to that, and then the amount of drills, they do get more incremental and a little bit faster.",
            "So right now, I\u2019d say, validation is something the 1A Enterprises and the mature teams are doing or will be doing shortly. And for the folks that are less mature, they may do it once, do a couple of quarters of remediation and then get back to doing it on a more repeated basis. But it\u2019s still in emerging market, I\u2019m just confident that it\u2019s going to be one that matters.",
            "We had a multi-decade run of patch management, let\u2019s just patch everything. But this is even better than that. This is unvarnished truth, doesn\u2019t attack work or not. And to me, that is something you can take up to the Board and have a very tangible and simple conversation rather than, well, we scanned 122,000 hosts. We had 57,000 vulnerabilities. We rack and stack those into four different buckets from critical to non-critical, and then here\u2019s where we\u2019re at in our remediation drills. Nobody understands it, nobody can comprehend it.",
            "So I\u2019m giving you a longer answer than what you asked for, but we like the growth that we\u2019re seeing with validation. But again, if you go to Gartner, or you go to other analysts, they\u2019re saying, this is a five years out sort of thing. Our goal is to let people know the value of it now, that it just provides more value now than so many other alternatives when you\u2019re trying to tweak the knobs on your security instrumentation."

            "So what you start doing is, saying, if you want to have more predictable revenues and knowing where your folks going to be working six weeks out, we do a lot of that with red teaming, but we got to get into what we call more strategic services. And the interesting thing is, with our specialty, I think last quarter, over 40% of our services revenues and maybe even higher than that were from responding to breaches. It\u2019s again hard to schedule it.",
            "But when you do those things, we\u2019re writing these remediation plans. And here\u2019s what to do about it. And most of the time when we\u2019re the first ones through the door, the pros from Dover, we are being asked to take somebody from security point A to security point B, how do we get better and how do we get there?",
            "And over the years, we\u2019ve kind of punted on those. And we said, you know what, that, that\u2019s somebody else\u2019s job, they can come in and do that. I believe right now, we\u2019ve got all this incredible frontline expertise. We\u2019re responding to these breaches. We\u2019re figuring out what happened and what to do about it. And then we\u2019re getting on the plane and flying back and we can\u2019t do that.",
            "We got to go the extra mile and start doing those transformation services in greater volumes. They\u2019re more predictable. They\u2019re stabilized. The spikes that you can get in services over time to get a bunch of incidents one quarter and not as many the next. And it also \u2013 another reason why we brought in Brad and we have Charles Carmichael internally running this is that Mandiant over the last six or seven years, we really haven\u2019t concentrated on the top of the pyramid for consulting.",
            "We\u2019ve hired a whole bunch of frontline responders. We have a whole bunch of directors managing it. They\u2019re unbelievably busy. They\u2019re unbelievably chargeable. But then what the other consulting firms would call the partner level, we don\u2019t have a lot of people. And if you want scale and services, that\u2019s where you have to hire, that\u2019s how you get it.",
            "So we\u2019re focusing on strategic services. We\u2019re focusing Jurgen Kutscher, who runs that on hiring at the top of the consulting pyramid to grow it. And we\u2019re absolutely phenomenal at it. That\u2019s one of the main thing.",
            "So everybody thinks, wow, you respond to breaches, that\u2019s just so tactical. It means you actually have total command of the strategy around transforming security operations. I believe we may write more transformation plan than anybody on the planet. We just don\u2019t help our customers go through them. So we\u2019re going to start doing it."

I mean, yes, there\u2019s no \u2013 well, it\u2019s very unlikely that the mix will be as high of incident response engagements and it\u2019s very unlikely we can maintain that level of chargeability in the third quarter, because the third quarter tends to be a little bit seasonal on the services side. There are more vacations, the summer slowdown in Europe, all kind of hits in the third quarter.",

But as we look forward, we\u2019ve been adding to the services team. So we feel very good about that longer-term. And I think with the growth on the platform cloud side, I think, you\u2019re going to see continued contributions there. And, like we talked about a little bit earlier on the stabilization on the product and related, I think, we\u2019ll see a little bit of\u2026"

But I felt like our nose were a little higher in Q2 based on capacity. But when that happens, you do get a little bit of burnout.",
            "When you get burnout, sometimes folks come off a couple of jobs and you have to give them a week to collect themselves, and that week is hitting in Q3 for us. And then at one of our last new hires, I just know the attendance at our last consulting onboarding was about 77 folks. When you add that many people, there\u2019s also that half step backwards to go two steps forward.",

Four engagements to get up to speed? Because I do know we\u2019re working. We\u2019re working remotely. We\u2019re working in a little bit differently. But there\u2019s no question, onboarding is probably going to take a tiny bit longer with on the job training.",
            "And then I think we\u2019re going to have to change. We did fixed fee jobs. You pay for us upfront. I think we\u2019re one of the only consulting cores running that way. I think in the COVID environment, we\u2019re going to have to change that a little bit. And we\u2019re a products company, we like billings, billings, collect upfront. That\u2019s not a services business, but we\u2019ve run our services in the model of it almost being a product.",
            "I think one of the ways we can continue the growth there is to start changing that payment cycle. Let\u2019s do the services first and then charge for it. And that\u2019s okay, and we may have to do a little bit more of that through this current environment."

In a way, that\u2019s how we were on endpoint with forensics and on e-mail, and we\u2019re kind of building into that layer one.",
            "So I believe this. The customers that have adopted FireEye, when they go to the cloud, it\u2019s just far more probable. They\u2019re going to bring us along with them, because they\u2019ve learned to rely on our technology to defend their networks. It may create some new opportunities for us as well. And we got to do it regardless. I\u2019m glad we did the work.",
            "But right now, it\u2019s a little early to tell. We have a 15-year run of the appliance business and only a couple of year run of cloudifying that capability. But now, it\u2019s really cloud native and we\u2019ll see how it does it. So that\u2019s a long-winded answer, Saket, to tell you this. 1A Enterprise, they want two layers of defense, they\u2019ll do it.

So, I won\u2019t say, it will \u2013 it will be stabilized forever at $300 million or so. But I think we\u2019ll see it in a stabilized range going forward.",

            "Yes, I think the important thing to keep understanding as you look at FireEye as a whole, the product and related business, while stabilized, it\u2019s generating a significant amount of cash that we\u2019re now able to invest in the growth areas of the business.",

It\u2019s that \u2013 you\u2019re not going to own every damn account on endpoint period. And the demand for our expertise in a second set of eyes to look at every single alert is something almost everybody I talked to once, and they\u2019re not going to throw out their endpoint for our endpoint just to get that.",
            "So it just makes sense for us to go in and say, what do you got and can we support it? And we should have a list of supported products. One of the best things about being on the frontlines of every breach is, we know exactly the detection efficacy of everybody\u2019s products. Granted, you can have user error and you configure them wrong and most products are probably only use it 60% of their potential.",
            "But we\u2019re just sitting there on the frontline seeing what gets evaded, how it gets evaded? And we need to apply that knowledge to more than just our technology period. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s more valuable for us to do that. We can do that. And it\u2019s just time we start doing it. So that\u2019s the rationale behind doing it for the managed defense.",
            "And by the way, we even do it in services. You can always show up to a breach and say, \u201cHey, no matter what you\u2019ve got, we\u2019re not going to use it. We\u2019re going to use our own stuff.\u201d We do have technology-enabled services. But we have responded to incidents collecting data using other technology, you have to be able to do it. It\u2019s as simple as well. I was just about to have an analogy that compared Microsoft with WordPerfect. But I don\u2019t think WordPerfect is around anymore.",
            "But the bottom line is, we use different technology to get the damn job done and we got to elongate that. So we\u2019re going to have supported products inside of managed defense, that\u2019s being run by Marshall Heilman and will support other endpoint technologies. And that\u2019s the number one use case for managed defense, verify that we have a damn problem. Answer the question every day all the time, are we compromised or not? And that\u2019s what managed defense does. And I just think, we \u2013 it should be growing faster than it is. This is probably the fastest way to unlock growth."

But the reality is, is we have more experienced folks and the overall cost of a lot of what we do is actually less than folks that send a whole bunch of folks at a lower rate. Eight people at $200 an hour is more than two people at $400 an hour and you get the same results.",

We, over time, have lowered the rate, if anything, although our average rate right now is high because of the incident response, where we have shown a willingness to lower the rates for what I would call strategic government work, where we just think it\u2019s strategically important to be involved in different security operations in \u2013 across the globe, by the way, with different Intel agencies or different Departments of Defense.",

When we look at kind of hiring across the Board, I think, given FireEye\u2019s position in the marketplace with the level of intelligence and expertise we have, it\u2019s an area that we\u2019re very successful from. I look at a lot of the people that we bring aboard and we have a lot of talented new individuals coming aboard that I think can really help take us to the next level.",

But no, I think, we feel really good about kind of a lot of the enablement that we\u2019ve been working on for some of the newer areas of the business. And I think Verodin, our Mandiant Validation is a perfect example of if you looked at the pipeline being built right well after the acquisition over the next couple of quarters, then you look at the pipeline being built after we went through a full kind of enablement and training, I think, the sales force got it.",
            "And I think they built a pretty significant pipeline that I think will drive significant growth there. So I think we\u2019ve got the right resources to Board. We think they\u2019re in the right level of as far as enablement goes. And so we should be in a good spot there."

            "Yes. I did write a couple of closing remarks right now. I\u2019ll spit them out at New Jersey auctioneer speed, because I know we\u2019ve been on for over an hour. But in closing, I just want to provide a quick update on the four priorities we outlined for 2020.",
            "Our first priority was we intend to be the best world at incident response, red teaming and threat intelligence. When I reviewed the first-half of 2020, we are performing more investigations at a faster pace this year than last year. And in third-party appraisals of our incident response and threat intelligence, we\u2019re in the top right, so I feel we\u2019re doing our jobs there.",
            "Our second priority was to extend our dynamic threat detection and expertise to defend cloud-based infrastructures. We addressed this priority with our acquisition of Cloud Advisory in the launch of our cloud security assessment service and consulting and our network security 9.0 release in the second quarter, which included our enhancements to support secure migration of workloads in the major cloud providers.",
            "Our third priority was to deliver our expertise on-demand seamlessly through our technology, where experts are available at the point where our customers need them most. And again, we developed expertise on-demand not to sell more services, but the differentiate our technology. I know, in my years of doing computer security at the Pentagon, I would have loved if we had a button to click on to get help.",
            "So we give that to our customers. And we are seeing our customers take advantage of this button, and our on-demand capability with their expertise on-demand revenue use up over 300% year-over-year, still a small number, but they\u2019re using it. And that\u2019s what we wanted.",
            "And finally, we want to be the best enrolled at security validation. We intend to make the process of measuring security effectiveness against the most current attacks as simple, continuous and as commonplace as we can make it. And the Mandiant Advantage portal that integrates our threat intelligence and validation will close the security gap between the attackers emerging techniques and the safeguards that are just too slow to adapt, or stop or detect these attacks.",
            "So I\u2019m very pleased that we\u2019re making progress in all our objectives. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Thank you for your interest in FireEye. And I look forward to speaking to all of you in 90 days. Until then, please stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much."
