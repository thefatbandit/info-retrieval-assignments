         "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the National Retail Properties Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me on this call is our Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Habicht.",
         "First, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to all the associates at National Retail Properties for their hard work, dedication, ingenuity, flexibility, and respect for each other as we address and work through the myriad of impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our lives and the business this past quarter, and to all of those first responders and health care workers who are out there keeping us safe and healthy, I offer our deepest thanks as well.",
         "Second quarter results for National Retail Properties reflect the basic strength and resiliency of our long-term strategy and business model. We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with $225 million of cash in the bank, plus $900 million of available capacity on our line of credit.",
         "Our fortress-like balance sheet and long-term perspective were driving factors behind the recent announcement of an increase in our common share dividend. Once that dividend is paid later this month 2020 will become our 31st year of increased dividends a feat matched by only two other REITs and less than 90 public companies in the United States.",
         "We collected approximately 69% of our rents due in the second quarter and agreed to defer approximately 21% of our second quarter rents. As the pandemic spread and businesses shut down, National Retail Properties adopted a very collaborative approach with those tenants that were materially impacted, while remaining measured, consistent, and fair.",
         "Our typical rent deferral agreement had a term of less than three months with repayment of the deferred rent typically commencing in the fourth quarter and continuing through the end of 2021. To us, this is the way a long-term partnership behaves.",
         "For those tenants that were unwilling to pay rent or agree to a deferral arrangement, we're pursuing our legal remedies for payment and enforcement of the lease. It is noteworthy that in all of our negotiations and agreements with tenants, we have forgiven only 0.1% of our quarterly base rent.",
         "Today's press release also includes our disclosure that July rent collections were approximately 84%. Consistent with our long-term practice of reporting results only quarterly, we do not anticipate reporting monthly rent collections for August or September prior to our third quarter earnings release.",
         "Our well-located retail properties were in high demand prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, as evidenced by our consistently high occupancy rate of 98%, plus or minus 1%, and our consistently high tenant lease renewal rate of 80% to 85% at approximately 100% of prior rent. Both of those impressive metrics continued to hold true through the first half of 2020, and we believe our properties will remain in high demand in the post pandemic world.",
         "Our pause in acquisitions was evident as we acquired no new properties in the second quarter, investing only $7 million to complete some projects that were already underway. Year-to-date, we have invested $74 million at 6.9% initial cash cap rate. We're continuing to take a thoughtful approach to new capital commitments and focusing on maintaining our strong liquidity position.",
         "Consistent with that philosophy, we have continued to raise capital in 2020 issuing $53 million of equity via our ATM and raising $40 million through property dispositions through the first half of the year. We ended the second quarter with more cash on the balance sheet than at the end of Q1, all without increasing our leverage. This is an enviable position from which to start the second half of 2020.",
         "In closing, I want to reiterate the long-term approach to all aspects of our business. We believe that well-located real estate acquired at reasonable prices, and leased to strong regional and national tenants at reasonable rents all supported by a low-leveraged balance sheet and a long-tenured staff of industry experts remains the right formula for creating shareholder value on a multiyear basis.",
         "With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more details on our second quarter results. "
      ],
      "Kevin Habicht": [
         "Thank you, Jay. And as usual, I'll start with our cautionary statement that we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in these forward-looking statements, and we may not release revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect changes after the statements were made.",
         "Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are disclosed from time-to-time in greater detail in the company's filings with the SEC and in this morning's press release.",
         "With that, headlines from this morning's press release report quarterly FFO results of $0.65 per share for the second quarter of 2020 and AFFO per share was reported at $0.49 per share, which reflects $30.2 million or $0.17 per share of noncash straight-line rents arising from the rent deferral agreements we discussed last quarter in connection with the economic shutdown.",
         "Occupancy was 98.7% at quarter end, that's down 10 basis points from the prior quarter. G&A expense was -- for the second quarter was 5.7% of revenues and that's down from 5.8% of revenues in the first quarter.",
         "The primary items of note in our second quarter results are rent collections and receivables. First, rent collections improved monthly throughout the second quarter and into July. Today, we reported rent collections of approximately 69% for the second quarter and 84% for the month of July.",
         "In the midst of the storm, it's never totally clear if we're doing too much or too little with our rent deferrals, but we're hoping we've struck a reasonable balance. And with the benefit of three months of hindsight, we are relatively pleased with the progress being made as we work with a number of our tenants to find a path forward to pay the rent they owe us.",
         "However, uncertainty continues, and it's our opinion it will be 2021 before we all get a better read on how the economy is going to perform. So, we remain cautious looking to reserve options, but we see some rays of light on the collections front.",
         "Now, over to receivables. First, accrued rental income receivables, sometimes called straight-line rent, we recognized $35.8 million of accrued rent related to the tenant rent deferral agreements, but reserved $5.6 million producing a net increase in accrued rent of $30.2 million for the quarter in connection with those rent deferral lease amendments.",
         "This accrued rental income is included in GAAP earnings, it's included in FFO, and core FFO results. But consistent with our past practice, we excluded accrued straight-line rent when calculating AFFO. We did footnote what AFFO would have been if we had not done this as I referenced at the beginning of my remarks.",
         "These rent deferral agreements were entered into with certain tenants which represented 21% of our -- the rent due in the second quarter. On average, the rent deferrals covered 2.4 months of rent, 84% of which related to second quarter rent and 16% relates to third quarter end. We expect to have 94% of these rent deferrals paid back to us by the end of 2021.",
         "Secondly, the rent receivables increased by $17 million during the second quarter. We established a reserve of $2.6 million resulting in a net rent receivable increase of $14.4 million for the quarter.",
         "These receivables are concentrated in our four retail lines of trades where our collections have generally been hit the hardest, which we noted on last quarter's call namely theaters, full-service restaurants, health and fitness, and family entertainment. We expect these receivables -- our receivables will be paid resolved with a rental deferral agreement or end up in litigation.",
         "We ended the second quarter with $225 million of cash on hand, no amounts outstanding on our bank credit facility. We did not draw down our bank line as many companies did. We have not made material new-property investments and our next debt maturity is in 2023, so we're in a very good liquidity position. And as our stock rallied 50% off its low -- lowest we opted to issue -- of common equity in the second quarter near $37 per share on average via our ATM. Not a large amount in the scheme of things, and you shouldn't read too much into it, but just adding a bit more cushion and help preserving options.",
         "Our weighted average debt maturity is now 10.7 years with a weighted average interest rate of 3.7%. Financial covenant compliance is in good shape as outlined on page 9 in the press release. So we're in a very good liquidity position with very few capital obligations during the next three years.",
         "Leverage metrics remain very strong. Net debt to gross book assets was 35.1%. Net debt-to-EBITDA was 4.8 times at June 30. Interest coverage was 4.6 times and fixed charge coverage was 4.1 times for the second quarter. Only five of our 3,117 properties are encumbered by mortgages totaling only $12 million.",
         "Consistent with last quarter, we have not provided 2020 earnings guidance in light of the uncertainty in the economy generally and in retail in particular. Until we get a better read on the economic recovery and what the new normal might look like, we're not able to reasonably predict precisely how things will play out. As we work through what is undoubtedly a challenging 2020 for the global economy we will continue to endeavor to give NNN the best opportunity to succeed in the coming years.",
         "And Karen, with that we will open it up for any questions."

         "Remarks": [
            "Brian, good morning. The -- yes, I would say that leasing demand right now is less than usual for vacant properties. I mean, I think, there's just a lot of businesses that are waiting to see what they want to do about opening new stores. But as I reported in my comments this morning, our lease renewal metrics have remained very consistent with our long-term average of around 80% to 85% of the tenants renewing their lease at around 100% of prior rent, and that is without the landlord providing any lease incentive or additional dollars to incentivize the tenant for that renewal. So, those renewals are on an as-is basis. So far, it's remained very consistent with our long-term average. "

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Great. And then, I guess, what would cause you to look at potentially extending any deferral agreements? And what could that look like if you were to start doing those extensions?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Brian Hawthorne"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. As we've talked about in the prior call and earlier in this call, we've taken a very collaborative approach with our tenants as an initial proposition for a first deferral. So, to the extent that tenant's business was significantly disrupted, we were quick to be willing to discuss short-term, deferral-only not forgiveness but deferral-only to be repaid starting later this year typically and continuing through the latter part of next year typically. ",
            "And to the extent tenants -- that's not enough for some tenants then we will engage in what we sometimes refer to with folks as a Phase 2 discussion, which would be a more far-ranging discussion about ways to create value for National Retail Properties if we have to do further deferrals or other provisions that you might have to do with the tenant to make things work out.",
            "And we have a lot of tools in that toolkit. We can talk about extending term. We can start to talk about changing lease rent bumps during the term of the lease. We can talk about new transactions. We can talk about substitution of properties that are currently leased for ones that the tenant might want to swap out. So, there's a lot of tools in that toolkit, but it really so far with us has not come into play in any great measure at all. We've had good success with these first initial deferrals that were as Kevin said, almost completely structured to deal with second quarter rent. And then you've seen in July that theater rents started to pick up notably. "

      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Spenser that's a good question, but I think it's kind of across the board. The lines of trade that have been -- that's struggling the most during the last few months has been the theaters and health and fitness, and those lines of trade kind of continue to struggle as those -- as it's difficult to get those businesses opened and reopened. So, I'd say that probably has not contributed much to the increase. But otherwise, I think, across the board the businesses got better. "

As we've said already in this call a few times, we take a long-term view of the business, and we just want to see how this continues to play out. Each month since April, things have gotten a little better and felt a little better, but you -- by no means no one is saying that this is behind us yet. So we just want to get a better feel for how the next few months are going to play out as that relates to pricing as well as cost of capital -- pricing for properties as well as cost of capital. "

Are you guys anticipating on queuing up some additional dispositions into year-end to possibly take advantage of that? Is that not in the cards or in the strategy at this point? How are you guys thinking about that and the opportunistic ability to be able to sell assets at potentially significantly lower cap rates than January or February? "

            "Yes. Rob, the dispositions has been a core competency for us for a long time, and we have a good steady flow of disposition business. When we've gone back and looked at it, only about call it 30% plus or minus of our dispositions have been to 1031 exchange buyers, and so we don't anticipate that affecting us a great deal in terms of those dispositions.",
            "We will see if we ramp that up come the end of the year. A lot of our 1031 dispositions are kind of reverse inquiries where we're being contacted by buyers who are trying to get through. So you're right there may be a push to do that at the end of the year that will be kind of demand-driven, but we'll see. It's not a big component of our overall disposition platform."

And then when you look at your more challenged operators out there whether or not it be Dave & Buster's, Main Event Chuck-E-Cheese's, the theaters or the gyms, is there any significant lease expirations coming up in those categories in 2021, where the operator has been challenged and you're likely to get the assets back at that point rather than being a renewal?

      "17": {
         "Remarks": [

            "As it relates to dispositions, so far it's been a kind of our usual balance between occupied and vacant. I think three of our eight this past quarter \u2013 three of our eight properties sold in the second quarter were vacant, which again in terms of mix it's kind of the normal. I think going forward we'll \u2013 again, we'll see \u2013 sorry to keep kind of saying that. You will see if that picks up or not. It seems like it would but we'll just have to see."

And so that's what you will see us attempt to do first and foremost as always. But we may be a little bit quicker to dispose of vacant properties and monetize those, if we have not had success getting them re-leased within nine months or a year. Historically, we sometimes held properties longer than that trying to get them re-leased and we may be a little bit quicker to monetize that and turn that money into new acquisitions."

I know during NAREIT, you'd offer a certain kind of hypothetical bear-case view on occupancy. And I'm just wondering now that we're a couple of more months under our belt like how were you thinking about the effects of a recession on occupancy versus say the GFC?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. It's still hard \u2013 very hard to answer that. I will say, I think we're probably slightly more optimistic than we were. I mean, like I said with the benefit of three months of hindsight, it feels like things are moving in the right direction. Collections obviously have picked up. We actually had a couple of rent deferral agreements that got sent back to us and said \"We've got the money. We're going to pay you rent. We don't need the deferral agreement.\" At the margin slightly better.",
            "Having said that, we \u2013 I think one of the ways we've framed this is that 2008 and 2009, we lost 300, 350 basis points of occupancy and this feels worse than that.",
            "So we obviously think it will be more than that. But we think, whatever that number is, which we don't know obviously, it appears that we'll be just fine, in terms of balance sheet, dividend, all the critical kind of metrics. And it really just becomes a matter of re-leasing properties in due course, and getting back or returning back on the acquisition engine, when we think it's appropriate."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And then just last one for me, if I can clarify. You had alluded to the fact that, if you need to offer more deferrals you might look at pulling certain levers, in terms of bumps et cetera. But, just as you think -- as we think about the next six months, is this your base case? Like, are you planning for a certain percentage of deferrals to just continue through the balance of the year?"

And the tenants will otherwise get back on the regular rent-payment schedule, through this third quarter and into the end of the year.",
            "It would be unrealistic to assume that, we won't have some other problems. And need to do some additional deferrals or lease restructurings with some tenants. But to-date, to echo Kevin's, modest sense of optimism to date we've had very few discussions about those kinds of things, with tenants."

One the accrued rent receivable, which we've always had over the years, but we added to significantly in the second quarter as a result of the lease -- the rent deferral lease amendments. And so, that accrued rent receivable went up $35.8 million. We reserved $5.6 million just for that accrued rent receivable.",

And then, in July, can you provide the bucket -- out of the 16% remaining, can you provide the amount deferred and the amount unresolved? And then I guess the second part of that question is, maybe you can give a little bit more color on that unresolved bucket. What portion of that are you pursuing those legal remedies?

There's probably 6% that's being deferred in third quarter. As I mentioned, some of our deferrals billed in the third quarter and then 10% is still unresolved. It's a little still hard to handicap exactly how it's going to -- that 10% is going to get broken out between collected, which we've had a fair amount collected, execute a deferral agreement or litigate. And so, we're in the early stages of sorting that out."

And about half of it is in discussions with tenants that I'm less optimistic won't -- will result in a deferral agreement, more likely may end up in legal process. But those are with -- a lot of the tenants that make up that 10% are large strong companies that have simply chosen, either not to pay or not to agree to deferral terms that we think, are fair and reasonable."
