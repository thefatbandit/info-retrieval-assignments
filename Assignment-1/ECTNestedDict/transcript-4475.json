            "But what I really wanted to ask is, how that\u2019s shaping Visa\u2019s resource allocation and investment decisions in a way that might be different from what you would have done six months ago?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I mean, the \u2013 I guess, the great thing for us has been that it\u2019s mostly tweaks, right? The \u2013 we haven\u2019t had to make significant changes, because if you go back to our Investor Day, which seems like a lifetime ago, but it was really only one month before all the restrictions were put in place, we laid out our growth strategy and it really is just as relevant in a post-COVID world as it was at that time in terms of focusing on expanding within consumer payments, expanding credentials, next-generation issuers, the unbanked, the wallet players.",
            "On the acceptance side, new acquirers, new form factors, like Tap to Phone, underpenetrated use cases like rent, the engagement of end users getting more activation and usage, removing friction. These are all key tenets of the strategy, all incredibly relevant today.",
            "In terms of the new flows getting more digital and B2B and P2P, G2C disbursements, B2C disbursements, in value-added services, security and identity, data solutions, consulting, like all these things were key tenants of the strategy and are actually being heightened in this environment.",
            "So it\u2019s mostly been about tweaking our resource allocation, little things, such as with e-commerce being such a more meaningful part of the volume, areas around getting approval rates up in e-commerce, which has always been a challenge, but I would say is taking on a little bit of more importance in this environment, areas like managing fraud online and making sure everyone in the ecosystem understands the capabilities that we can provide and how best to leverage them since a lot of people are relying more on e-commerce for the commerce that\u2019s being conducted today.",
            "Areas in contactless, so, there has always been caps in countries, but you\u2019ve heard a lot about caps have been increased in about 55 countries, like that\u2019s an example of something that has sort of taken on more importance in this [Technical Difficulty] and now working with those governments and regulators about keeping those caps in place and not necessarily dropping back to where they were prior to COVID.",
            "So we\u2019re \u2013 so there\u2019s some tweaking going on. We\u2019re really making sure that the key areas of growth for the medium to long-term continue to get the resources that they need and we don\u2019t slowdown, and we are balancing that with the near-term realities that we have.",
            "So, you have seen, we\u2019ve been paring back marketing, our use of outside resources. We\u2019ve been getting better and better at redeploying our people to the more critical and high-growth areas.",
            "So I would say, if there\u2019s one thing that we\u2019re going to benefit from long-term is, we\u2019re really building a very strong muscle in the redeployment of resources and being more flexible as a company. That\u2019s something that we kind of had to do out of necessity in this environment. But as time goes on, we\u2019re finding \u2013 we\u2019re getting better and better at it, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to leverage long after we\u2019re past this."

         "Remarks": [
            "Maybe some \u2013 with regards to what you said, maybe we can touch on something you did earlier this week or Visa did, which was you announced click-to-pay availability in Canada. So maybe talk about click-to-pay as a solution set that the EMVCo networks are bringing to bear, seemingly to try to sell for guest checkout, but obviously, things go well, it could go well beyond guest \u2013 just what\u2019s limited to guest checkout at this point.",
            "So maybe talk about that launch. We haven\u2019t seen any marketing yet in any real way. Is \u2013 should we expect to see the airways blitzed with marketing for click-to-pay around the holidays? Because with Apple Pay, it was sort of like product launch, no availability, all the marketing was spent when you couldn\u2019t use it, and then it kind of disappeared for a while. So\u2026"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Craig Maurer"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "That\u2019s right. So you\u2019re touching on exactly how we think about it. So a lot of the launches are focused on the seller side right now. So that\u2019s really the focus, which is making sure there are enough places to use it. So that when you do really step up the the consumer side awareness that there \u2013 they have places to use it.",
            "So, we do have over \u2013 we\u2019ve converted over 10,000 merchants here in the U.S. We have started to roll out outside of the U.S. now in about 10 countries. We have over 2,000 merchants who have turned it on. So we\u2019re making good progress.",
            "I would say, we will start to get, I guess, more aggressive in terms of awareness and working with issuers to make sure there\u2019s communication to consumers about using it once we feel like we have sort of adequate coverage on that side, on the seller side. And so that\u2019s really the order that we\u2019re going in. And you\u2019re right, the primary focus is guest checkout.",
            "So we\u2019re \u2013 if there\u2019s a really strong card on file merchant, it\u2019s not our immediate focus to try to convert them or win them over. It really is taking the friction out of that. It\u2019s roughly half of transactions online today are done through a guest checkout experience that still has a lot of friction, takes too long. And so, that\u2019s sort of the priority in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about the roll out and the staging of how we do it."

      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I would say, in the early days, everyone sort of went sort of on lockdown, right, and they weren\u2019t changing their systems. So I would say, in the early days, there wasn\u2019t a lot of progress or action happening. In maybe about the June timeframe, I would say, people started to feel more comfortable and were adapting. And I would say, that is when we started expanding outside the U.S., for example.",
            "So prior to COVID, we really were only focused on the U.S.. And once we got through those initial months of COVID, we did start expanding outside the U.S. and because we are seeing a lot of demand. Many markets are looking for you to take that friction out, particularly places where there\u2019s higher levels of authentication required, right?",
            "So there are many places like in India, you may have heard us talk about. We had already rolled out solutions in India to deal with the two-factor authentication mandate and try to take the friction out of payments there. And so there are a number of markets, where that pain, I guess, is more acute, because card on file players are not as pervasive as they may be are here in the U.S. And so, that is part of the \u2013 what\u2019s happening in that expansion that you\u2019re hearing about."

      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Maybe sticking with the e-com theme and omni-channel theme right now, can you talk about Visa\u2019s economics in a card-not-present versus card-present transaction? There has been a lot of confusion about this. And there\u2019s also, obviously, geographies to think about, where things might be different as well, but in general terms?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Craig Maurer"
      },
      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. In general terms, yes, you\u2019re right. There\u2019s always nuances, of course, local nuances. But in general terms, our pricing is no different. So for our core payment processing capability, our core data processing service fees, international fees do not vary, whether you\u2019re there in person or you\u2019re online. Interchange often does and that\u2019s what sometimes leads to confusion, but our fees are generally not different.",
            "The only area that then is sort of an indirect benefit, if you will, [of spend] [ph] when things go online is it does tend to increase our ability to sell additional services, fraud being the best example, sort of fraud, identity risk areas is probably the best example, where people \u2013 because the risks are higher online, but also the fraud is much more sophisticated, we tend to see a much higher adoption of our capabilities on those transactions than we do in the face-to-face environment."

         "Speaker": "Mike Milotich"
      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. So let\u2019s move to a different component of your business and probably the most important thought process for many investors right now, excuse me, cross-border. Having seen six months of the pandemic, effectively, how is your opinion or the internal opinion of Visa changed in terms of how the shape of the recovery might play out?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Craig Maurer"
      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I would say, the cross-border business and really the recovery, in general, it\u2019s been quite unpredictable. So we\u2019re really taking it one quarter at a time. It\u2019s very difficult to say what\u2019s going to happen six, nine months from now. And if, we had made those predictions back in April, May, we would have been pretty far off, I think, the domestic recovery has certainly been a positive surprise.",
            "The key thing that we\u2019re watching so closely is the \u2013 and we talked a little bit about on our earnings call is just the opening of the borders, because right now, we really can\u2019t distinguish whether people don\u2019t want to travel or cannot travel, and it\u2019s a very important distinction.",
            "So, we are seeing cross-border travel significantly impacted, but it\u2019s also incredibly difficult to do it even if you want to. And so, the opening of borders and whether that\u2019s tied to sort of medical advances is really some of the key things we\u2019re watching, because when they are open, we are seeing encouraging signs, right?",
            "On our call in late July, we talked about the U.S. traveling to places like Mexico and the Caribbean, or travel within Europe, areas that had opened up already, we were seeing significant improvement in a short period of time. And in many ways, that has continued.",
            "So, for example, the U.S. and Mexico corridor had positive year-over-year growth in August. So, that\u2019s a pretty good sign of how things are evolving. Turkey, which is another great example, which opened their borders on August 1. So fairly recently, and by the end of the month, the year-over-year growth was still negative, but it had improved by more than 30 points, just in those four weeks since the borders opened.",
            "So, those are signs that there are at least a number of people who are willing to travel if they\u2019re able. And so, that\u2019s really the key thing we\u2019re focused on. The only other thing I would mention is that, the e-commerce that\u2019s non-travel, which is about a third of our volume, we really are focused on that from a user experience perspective.",
            "I touched on it earlier in terms of looking at approval rates and managing the fraud, because retail spending, which is the majority of that volume is performing really well. It\u2019s been growing around 30% in \u2013 excluding into Europe within that space. And so, we are \u2013 which is significantly higher than pre-COVID levels.",
            "So we are seeing as more people go online in a market, that suddenly doesn\u2019t mean they have to be shopping domestically, like they would when they went out to a physical store. They can do it cross-border, and we are seeing that shift and that growth. And so that is an area that we\u2019re focused on to try to make sure that, that\u2019s as good of experiences as we can manage."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Mike Milotich"
      },
      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Maybe to help investors conceptualize this, what \u2013 to me, a consumer, when I buy something cross-border online using my Visa card, I don\u2019t see a difference in what happens. But what\u2019s Visa doing in the background, that\u2019s enabling that transaction that\u2019s different from a domestic transaction?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Craig Maurer"
      },
      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I mean, the biggest difference is that, typically, in your \u2013 if you think about a lot of our risks tools and fraud services, we\u2019re looking at 500-plus data elements, about all components of your activity, what\u2019s your spend history, even location. So, in your day-to-day life, you\u2019re tending to sort of spend in a relatively small geographic area, for example.",
            "And so when you go online and you\u2019re buying something that\u2019s less common and really far away, then it \u2013 there\u2019s always going to be that question, is it really you? And so, the really big difference of what we\u2019re doing is helping both sides of the ecosystem, use as many tools as possible to determine whether it is you.",
            "So, things like, what\u2019s the IP address that you\u2019re using, right? What\u2019s the device that you\u2019re using? Have we seen transactions with those combinations before? And if we have, then we can probably be more confident that it\u2019s you. So a lot of it is using different data elements and then \u2013 and our tools are there. And a lot of times, it comes to then helping our clients make sure they\u2019re effectively utilizing them.",
            "So like, for example, one of our fraud tools allows you, it has all the levers, if you will, that you can pull to manage fraud. And what you can do is adjust the levers and then run the last 12 months of your data through those new parameters, and it\u2019ll give you an estimate of how much more transactions you may have approved and what your fraud would have been by leveraging the data that we have.",
            "And so a lot of it is just working with our clients to make sure they understand what\u2019s available to them and how to really harness the power of those tools to approve all the good transactions and obviously stop all the fraud \u2013 fraudulent transactions. That\u2019s the ultimate goal."

      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "When we think about cross-border, typically, in the past, we\u2019ve thought about cross-border transactions having a yield for Visa, they could be up to three times that of domestic. Does that hold \u2013 that dynamic hold in the card-not-present environment?"

      },
      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So again, our pricing is really no different. And so, same pricing applies whether your card-present or card-not-present."

      },
      "17": {
         "Remarks": [
            "But the same services are brought to bear in both cases, in terms of your ability to earn from adding on additional services, or that are needed for cross-border?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Craig Maurer"
      },
      "18": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I would say that similar to domestic, it \u2013 once you go online, there does tend to be a higher adoption of the capabilities."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Mike Milotich"
      },
      "19": {
         "Remarks": [
            "In the online environment, do you see more or less dynamic currency conversion that might take the currency or the currency fees and move them to the acquirer?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Craig Maurer"
      },
      "20": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I think it does vary. And I would say, Dynamic Currency Conversion or DCC is more common in the face-to-face environment. And again, from our perspective, our economics are set up that we\u2019re basically in different, whether you are DCC as a consumer or not.",
            "On \u2013 in the online space, I would say, it\u2019s not as much about DCC, but about multi-currency pricing, where the merchant only offers you \u2013 they sort of read your IP address and they only offer you prices in the currency that they know is your home currency. So which is a little bit different than DCC, which is sort of done \u2013 you see the local price and then they offer you to pay in local currency online. It\u2019s more typical that they just offer you the currency that they believe you is your home currency."

      "21": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Internally, in the discussions you\u2019ve been having, how do you \u2013 how are you guys thinking about the stickiness of the habits that we\u2019ve seen through COVID? This is the biggest question, frankly, that we get day-to-day from investors, because it\u2019s driven so much performance in the group?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Craig Maurer"
      },
      "22": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 yes, it is one of the big questions. I guess, our belief is that many of the changes have staying power. So, I would say, the two biggest trends, right, are the how much debit has outperformed credit and just the shift to e-commerce, right? Those are two of the real fundamental shifts that have happened.",
            "And on the debit front, I\u2019ll talk about each. From a debit perspective, if you just look at the U.S. in the 2008, 2009 crisis, right, we didn\u2019t see that it took about three years for credit to sort of get back to the pre-crisis normal.",
            "So it \u2013 there was quite a bit of time before where debit was continued to be preferred. And what\u2019s also happening in this environment that\u2019s unique different than 2008, 2009 is that there is this acceleration and past displacement. And that\u2019s primarily benefiting debit, right? I mean, already, when you were using credit, you were using cash. You were already using electronic form.",
            "But what we\u2019re really seeing is one of the big things that\u2019s driving debit performance is a lot of more people not going to the ATM, but using the card to pay directly with things, either because in the face-to-face environment, merchants even have signs that are saying, \u201cWe really prefer you to pay with a card and not cash,\u201d or there \u2013 with that shift online, as we\u2019ve talked about many times, once the transaction moves online, our share of the checkout goes up significantly.",
            "And so those two things combined have really fueled debit performance. And so we do think that, that is going to continue to make debit probably a bigger part of the business for many years to come.",
            "And then on the e-commerce side, what we\u2019re seeing is not only an increase in adoption, but also the average spend per user. Both things are up. And the same thing for contact us in the face-to-face world, once people have tried that and starting to get used to it, we believe that many people are just going to like that experience and not want to go back.",
            "So \u2013 and to some degree, some of the evidence you already see in our numbers, we\u2019re seeing it globally. But we at least have disclosed what you see in the U.S., which shows that our e-commerce non-travel spending in the U.S. has been growing consistently over 30%. While card-present has improved 40 points since the April timeframe that never impacted the e-commerce growth rate, right?",
            "So even as people are spending more in a face-to-face environment, that growth in e-commerce is sustaining. And so we do think a lot of the shifts are going to stay the exact magnitude, obviously, only time will tell. But we\u2019re confident that a lot of these things are going to be relatively permanent acceleration of these secular trends that were already occurring."

            "And so, when there are staged wallets like PayPal, for instance, you may consider them a staged wallet in some instances, but they provide that transparency and the data. So that ecosystem risk and everyone who is involved in that transaction has full transparency as to what\u2019s actually happening. And we think that\u2019s critical.",
            "And when there are staged wallets that don\u2019t provide that or mask sort of the true buyer and the true seller, that\u2019s when we think it\u2019s not good for the ecosystem in terms of managing risk in KYC, AML, et cetera. So that\u2019s how we think about staged wallets."

            "Yes. So there are very specific rules in terms of that really come even from the acquiring side in terms of when a merchant is of a certain size that has to be independently underwritten, right? So it\u2019s not like a player like PayPal can just be the merchant of record for everything, right? They\u2019re to ensure that there is visibility in terms of what is the system level risk.",
            "And so there are instances where it\u2019s a very small merchant, and you may not be able to \u2013 well, we\u2019ve worked at one of the things that was core to our agreement when our sort of landmark agreement, if you will, four or five years ago with PayPal, where they \u2013 not only we address consumer choice, but also sort of the transparency of data for the benefit of ecosystem.",
            "So I would say, with PayPal, we have a great partnership and it gets managed very well. And we sort of would hold that up as actually a great example of how it should be done. And it\u2019s great that, obviously, one of the largest players is \u2013 sets a good example for the ecosystem."

We\u2019ve seen Europe discuss taking another look at this. They\u2019ve also, this week, addressed Visa\u2019s staged wallet fees in Europe. So talk to me about perhaps regulatory hotspots, how you\u2019re managing the risks associated with this?"

            "Yes. It\u2019s an interesting dynamic, because on one hand, there\u2019s more volume going through electronic payments, which would \u2013 you would think would get them, obviously, more interested in say, \u201cOh, maybe the cost to merchants is going up.\u201d",
            "But also this environment is also showcasing just how much value electronic payments add and how innovations like tap to pay and omnicommerce and tokens and intelligent fraud scoring, all these things are enabling frictionless secure commerce that is it, for the most part, keeping most economies afloat, right?",
            "So I would say, it\u2019s a balance, right? Most of our dialogue with the local regulators is the same as it\u2019s always been, which is making sure they understand all the dynamics and the complexities. And at least for the most part, what we hear is, although, they may be looking at it and they really always are, at least, in this environment, most people \u2013 most regulators are hearing, this is not the time to make a change, right, because of how critical this is to economic activity right now.",
            "So, we\u2019ve said before that, the regulator has always been active in Europe and will continue to be. Not all of the regulation has been bad for our business. Things like separation of scheme and processing, PSD2, we actually think those have created opportunities for us. And we\u2019ve shown our ability to manage it and we\u2019ll keep managing as it comes."

            "Okay. So I wanted to move on to probably the biggest Visa specific topic that I address these days, which is the growth of Visa Direct. How Earthport fits into the ambitions within Visa, whether it\u2019s Visa? And frankly, so a lot about B2B, how Visa Direct can fit into that, or B2C in reversing that transaction? And again, how Earthport extends the reach of Visa, given you have the biggest reach in the industry in terms of global debit card penetration?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Craig Maurer"
      },
      "32": {
         "Remarks": [
            "That\u2019s right. Yes. So Earthport is really is going to play a huge role. And we only, I guess, it was really right around the time just before the pandemic hit is when we completed the integration, which allowed our customers through a single connection to Visa to access both card and account rails.",
            "And we do see that as incredibly critical, because, as you mentioned, we already have such a great reach through our debit business. And then even before we acquired Earthport, we were already extending that reach through our ATM network, right, and we talked a lot about like in Canada, for example, where almost every debit card is Interac branded, but a lot of them have plus our international ATM network on the back.",
            "And through that, we\u2019re able to allow those banks to give those cardholders access to Visa Direct services, even though the card is not branded Visa. And then on top of that, then you add Earthport, which allows us to access the \u2013 almost every bank account in almost 90 countries, which basically gives us the coverage that allows us to enable consumer choice, right?",
            "So the person that, that runs that business for us always says, like really the motto is, how do you want to be paid? And what Earthport allows us to do is offer for a partner through a single connection to Visa is to \u2013 whoever is going to be on the receiving end of the payment, to say, how would you like to receive it? Do you have a debit card, a prepaid card, credit card, bank account number? And whatever they choose, Visa can help them deliver the money.",
            "And so it really is a critical aspect to our strategy in things like international remittance, where it\u2019s going to play an increasingly large role and you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019re starting to expand into \u2013 to new corridors. I think, just last quarter, Remitly expanded into seven new corridors, MoneyGram 11 new corridors. MoneyGram commented on their earnings call that they are seeing new customers come to them. They\u2019re seeing higher ticket sizes when they use Visa Direct.",
            "And so it really is a key driver of that, allowing that choice, where we can offer all the different ways that a business would want to pay, right? And with our network of network strategy, being able to have the buyer and the seller make a different choice, right?",
            "So I want to pay with a virtual card and the merchant wants to receive money via RTP. We can provide that kind of capability that really a few others can. And certainly, our scale is sort of unrivaled in this area.",
            "And so that\u2019s how we think about how Earthport fits into the overall strategy for both disbursements, as well as international remittance and B2B, mostly in more small business to medium-sized business area, the very large business, we plan to mostly address with our B2B Connect platform."

            "Okay. For those that are listening, we\u2019ve talked about this extensively. But maybe you can run through just quickly the capability that Earthport brings to Visa, because I think, it\u2019s actually really important to the future of Visa\u2019s network?"

      },
      "34": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So what it allows us to do is get access to \u2013 they\u2019re directly connected to ACH and RTP system. So if you think about in a country, every country at least has an ACH system, maybe they\u2019ve upgraded to RTP. And Earthport is connecting directly into that system, which then allows them to access any bank account that\u2019s connected to that ACH, RTP network, which is typically going to be pretty much every bank account in that country.",
            "And the real power of what it provides is, because ACH and RTP are inherently local, they all have different technology, file formats, regulatory requirements, which is what makes this part of the business incredibly complicated for people to manage. And what Earthport allows us to do is take that burden away from our customers.",
            "So, say, you just send us the basic account information, let us worry about regulatory file formats, all these other things that make it navigating the different countries around the world quite complex. We take all that burden away.",
            "And at the same time, we\u2019re also offering fraud compliance capabilities and services that also take some of that burden away. Because what \u2013 any person who is in the business of moving money cross-borders will tell you, compliance is a huge part of the business. And so doing that effectively is also a huge part of the value that we add.",
            "And the last thing I would say that, that Earthport enables is, think about all the number of sort of multinational marketplace type environments, whether it\u2019s a commerce side or it\u2019s a vacation rental, or it\u2019s a marketplace where people build apps and they have to pay developers.",
            "As you download them, the developer needs to get paid. All these systems have to pay. Their customers are small businesses, who are essentially contributing to that marketplace, and they need to be paid. And what Earthport just allows us a lot more choice and global ubiquity. With one partnership to Visa, they can offer many forms of payment everywhere in the world."

            "Okay. Maybe we can talk about the B2B aspect here, because, as a team, we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time on that. And frankly, the TAM that Visa shows on B2B is eye-popping.",
            "So perhaps, we can first talk about virtual cards. You had touched on it a little bit. Talk to us about how virtual cards are contributing to that, because many of the other investment stories out there, a lot of it is predicated on \u2013 their growth is predicated on the penetration of virtual cards as an option to pay?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, yes. So the \u2013 I guess, the first thing I would say is, first in virtual cards, it\u2019s relatively mature in travel. And certainly, I guess \u2013 and fuel is maybe getting there sort of the fleet use cases. But many other industries and verticals, it\u2019s still very early days for virtual cards. And so there is an incredible amount of growth opportunity, because you do see huge efficiency gains when people use it.",
            "So the big focuses we have in that space is, one is acceptance, right? We have a lot of people who want to use virtual cards, but we also need businesses who want to accept it just as we have in our consumer payments, we\u2019re always looking to expand the reach of who will accept that, that form of payment. And you also work with players like our partnership with Billtrust, for example, that removes a lot of the complexity of virtual cards and makes it more seamless and easy to use for those who use it.",
            "The other aspect to it, though, that also gets hung up is the cost of acceptance and interchange. And so, one of the things that, that we\u2019ve done is enable within our network that a large buyer and a large supplier could negotiate a bilateral arrangement, but then still leverage our network to have all the efficiency that comes with virtual cards. So they can get all the efficiency gains, and if they need to agree on a price.",
            "Now, that\u2019s not something that can be done for every combination, right? That\u2019s not a realistic scenario. But among large buyers and large suppliers, that\u2019s something that, that we\u2019re enabling to give them the flexibility to agree on a price essentially to use that as a payment option."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Yes. So I would say, the \u2013 yes \u2013 probably two of the bigger opportunities are the two that hit on the data processing line, which is our everything related to fraud, authentication, security capabilities, as well as our CyberSource platform.",
            "So when you look at it first in the area of sort of transaction security and fraud, right, the \u2013 we have both tools on the issuer side, as well as the seller side, where, again, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re very sophisticated, analyzing hundreds of attributes of the data.",
            "And then using deep learning and AI capabilities to help players in the ecosystem recognize fraud before it happens. And as things shift online more and more and fraud there is much more sophisticated, that\u2019s a huge growth for the business. And then sort of a something related to that is also in areas of authentication.",
            "So there are many markets that are introducing mandates for more sophisticated authentication like PSD2 in Europe, that also creates a great opportunity. And we made an acquisition several years ago, Cardinal Commerce, that really specializes in this space. And, again, with the acceleration of the shift to digital and the shift online, these are the types of areas of the business that are growing quite rapidly.",
            "And then on CyberSource, the key shift that we\u2019ve made in CyberSource that you\u2019ve heard us talk about in the last 18 to 24 months is rather than just being a gateway that services merchants will really become an omnicommerce platform that acquirers can leverage to offer omnicommerce capabilities to their merchants and do it with \u2013 get all the scale and sophistication benefits that Visa has to offer those capabilities to their merchant customers.",
            "And this not only gets us working closer with partners of ours already in other parts of the business, but it\u2019s a huge growth opportunity, because many of these companies either don\u2019t have the capabilities or just don\u2019t have the scale to make these investments themselves. And so they can leverage our platform.",
            "And so that\u2019s an area, where we see incredible growth opportunity in the coming years, as we enter into more of these types of arrangements and the volume tends to scale. The partner that we mentioned at Investor Day, for example, is the largest acquirer in Japan, is a company that is using these capabilities from us.",
            "The other area that I would say probably has \u2013 that we\u2019re most excited about does hit our other revenue line, which is everything around sort of data, insights and analytics, and the kind of consulting that tends to often go along with that, but really harnessing our data to benefit our clients and the ecosystem.",
            "Traditionally, that was always done through fraud, but now more and more giving them insights into how are they performing benchmarking versus other players in their country, what\u2019s happening in other markets that they can learn from, and have all that sort of easily at their fingertips and being refreshed on a weekly basis, so they can see things in almost near real-time and incredible granularity. These are the things that every business and every industry is getting smarter and smarter about how to use data to make better decisions makings and we\u2019re uniquely positioned to add that incremental value for clients.",
            "And so that\u2019s also an area that we can help them a lot. Like one of the services, like one of the areas we\u2019re helping them right now is to make \u2013 we\u2019ve rolled out a service that a few of our clients are using to help them make credit line decisions, right? So looking at spend behavior and spend patterns, we can use that information to say, \u201cOkay, is it a risk to increase that person\u2019s credit line or not?\u201d and help an issuer make that kind of decision."
