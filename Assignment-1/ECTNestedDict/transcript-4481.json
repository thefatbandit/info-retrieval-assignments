         "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Before the markets opened this morning, we issued and posted to IDACORP\u2019s website our second quarter 2020 earnings release and Form 10-Q. The slides that accompany today\u2019s call are also available on our website. We\u2019ll refer to those slides by number throughout the call today.",
         "As noted on Slide 2, our discussion includes forward-looking statements, including earnings guidance, which reflect our current views on what the future holds, that are subject to several risks and uncertainties, including those related to the COVID-19 public health crisis. This cautionary note is also included in more detail for your review in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today, and we caution against placing undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.",
         "As shown on Slide 3, on today\u2019s call, we have Lisa Grow, IDACORP\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Keen, IDACORP\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other company representatives available to help answer any questions you may have after Steve and Lisa provide updates.",
         "On Slide 4, we present our quarterly financial results. IDACORP\u2019s 2020 second quarter earnings per diluted share were $1.19, an increase of $0.14 per share from last year\u2019s second quarter. IDACORP\u2019s earnings per diluted share for the first six months of 2020 were $1.94, an increase of $0.04 per share from the same period last year. Today, we also reaffirmed our full year 2020 IDACORP earnings guidance estimate to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 per diluted share with our expectation that Idaho Power will not need to utilize any of the tax credits in 2020 that are available to support earnings in Idaho under its regulatory settlement stipulation.",
         "These are our estimates as of today as we have seen a relatively modest net financial impact from the COVID-19 pandemic to date. However, as you would expect, it is difficult to predict the full impact of evolving economic conditions on Idaho Power\u2019s customers and suppliers and how that could affect the upper end of the earnings guidance range or the use of tax credits if the pandemic worsens or is prolonged.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Steve."
      ],
      "Lisa Grow": [
         "Thank you, Steve. And thanks to everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. I will begin with some comments around the pandemic, and I\u2019d like to start by celebrating the resilience of our workforce. Since the onset of this crisis, our company moved quickly to ensure we can continue to safely provide reliable energy to our customers. Our business is critical to the daily lives of our customers and the communities we serve.",
         "And while COVID-19 has presented unprecedented challenges, our employees\u2019 ability to continue delivering on our mission has been remarkable. Our line stations and power supply teams and other field workers have taken extra precautions to operate safely and efficiently. Meanwhile, most of our office employees have been working remotely for more than four months.",
         "Our workforce has carried on without any discernible impact on our operations or on our customers. While our employees have consistently exceeded expectations during my career at Idaho Power, I am more grateful and proud than ever to work with such an amazing group of people. Their work during this crisis is a testament to our company\u2019s mission, values and culture.",
         "Thanks to the efforts of our workforce, we have been able to carry on our generation, transmission and distribution operations without major disruption. We\u2019ve made efforts to limit impacts on customers, including voluntarily suspending disconnects \u2013 disconnections and waiving late fees at the onset of COVID-19. While the Idaho Commission has allowed us to resume disconnections next month, we will continue to proactively communicate with customers and to work on payment plans with those who may be struggling financially.",
         "Slide 8 shows our sales and load data compared to forecast since the health crisis began to impact our service area, although it\u2019s worth noting that variables outside of the pandemic, weather, in particular, also impact these figures. Overall, since the end of March, net retail sales have been about 2% lower than what we had forecasted going into 2020, with lower commercial and industrial loads driving most of the decrease. While these same customer categories impacted our second quarter results when compared with the prior year, the impacts of those load decreases were more than offset by customer growth, higher residential customer usage and a return to more normal irrigation usage.",
         "The states of Idaho and Oregon have been progressing through various phases of virus response, although not always in a linear fashion and continuing to adjust as the pandemic unfolds. It would be reasonable to expect continued decreased commercial and industrial loads in the short term compared with last year.",
         "But customer growth, strong energy sales for residential and irrigation customers and wise management of operations and maintenance expenses should allow us to continue executing on our 2020 strategy and achieve our business goals. Despite the current challenges, we remain cautiously optimistic about the future economic recovery and growth across our service area.",
         "On the topic of growth, if you look to Slide 9, you will note that Idaho Power saw a 2.6% increase in customer growth during the 12 months ending June 30, which matches the Q1 growth rate and continues the trend we\u2019ve now seen for several years.",
         "Idaho is projected to be one of the fastest-growing states in the country going forward. And Idaho Power is well positioned to support that growth with reliable, affordable, clean energy for new residents as well as incoming and expanding businesses.",
         "Employment and unemployment numbers in our service area have, of course, been impacted by COVID-19, and we will continue to monitor them closely. As of the end of June, unemployment in our service area was 6% compared with 11.1% nationally and 3% in our service area in June of 2019. Moody\u2019s forecasted GDP now calls for a decline in output of 3.8% in 2020, with a projected rebound of 4% in 2021 and 8% \u2013 8.2% in 2022. These numbers compare favorably with projections for the U.S. economy as a whole. GDP forecasts have incorporated the most current expected impacts.",
         "On the economic development front, Twin Falls based Chobani completed a notable expansion in the second quarter, adding new lines for its new oat-based yogurt product. The new Amazon Fulfillment Center in Nampa is also progressing towards completion later this year. And it is on schedule to be one of the fastest Amazon has ever built from groundbreaking to fulfilling orders.",
         "Despite uncertainty and other challenges caused by COVID-19, projects under construction in Idaho Power service area continue to move forward without major delays. We are seeing a steady stream of inquiries from potential customers, particularly in the food processing and manufacturing sectors. Thanks to affordable pricing and a business-friendly environment, our service area remains an attractive location for investment, and we expect the continued influx of new projects as we move past the pandemic.",
         "I have a couple of updates to share on our Boardman to Hemingway transmission project, also known as B2H. First, on July 2, the B2H project hit another significant permitting milestone by receiving a proposed order for the siting process from the Oregon Department of Energy. This milestone commences a contested case process that is expected to end with a final order and site certificate from the state of Oregon in the second half of 2021. Second, Idaho Power and its coparticipants are exploring several service arrangements in maximizing the value of the B2H project to each coparticipant\u2019s customers. One potential change could include Idaho Power acquiring Bonneville Power Administration\u2019s ownership share and, in turn, providing transmission service to BPA and its Southeast Idaho customers.",
         "Discussions are ongoing. But under this scenario, Idaho Power may own up to 45% of the transmission line. If Idaho Power were to build BPA\u2019s portion of the project, we would work to develop an arrangement where our investors are in a normal return on the capital invested, while our retail customers would not bear the cost of that portion of the project.",
         "We do not anticipate Idaho Power filing a general rate case in Idaho or Oregon in the next 12 months, but given the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 crisis and its potential impact on the economy and the communities we serve, we will continue to monitor that situation closely. Steady customer growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and effective cost management, all play significant roles as we look at the need and timing of a future general rate case.",
         "Slide 10 shows the recent outlook of precipitation and weather from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. Current weather projections for the remainder of this summer and early fall suggest a 40% to 60% chance for above-normal temperatures and a range of normal to 40% chance of below-normal precipitation in Idaho Power service area. If this hot dry weather materializes, we would expect to see solid sales during the third quarter, particularly for residential and irrigation customers. Thanks to good reservoir storage conditions entering the summer, combined with a wet June this year, reservoir storage levels remain favorable for generating reliable, affordable, clean hydropower to the benefit of all customers during the hottest part of the year.",
         "I\u2019ll close my prepared remarks by reiterating my thanks to our employees for their commitment to safety, to our company\u2019s mission and to our customers. They continue to rise to the occasion despite the unusual circumstances of 2020. I also thank you, our owners, for your support and confidence in us as we navigate this pandemic.",
         "With that, Steve and I and the others on the call are happy to answer your questions."

         "Welcome to IDACORP\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded and webcast live. A complete replay will be available later today and for the next 12 months on the IDACORP website. [Operator Instructions]",
         "I will now turn the call over to Justin Forsberg, Director of Investor Relations and Treasury."
      ],
      "Steve Keen": [
         "Thank you, Justin. Let\u2019s move to Slide 5, where I will discuss our second quarter financial results as compared to the same quarter last year. Despite a fairly wet June and the impacts of the pandemic, overall, we had solid results, which we believe position us well as we move forward through the second half of 2020.",
         "On the table of year-over-year changes, you\u2019ll see that continued strong customer growth of 2.6% added $3.4 million to operating income. Also, although we saw higher precipitation in June, this quarter\u2019s irrigation sales were closer to normal than last year and helped offset the negative impacts of the pandemic, which decreased our commercial and industrial sales volumes the most.",
         "Residential customer usage was 6% higher than last year, mostly related to weather variations, but customers also spent more time at home due to the public health crisis. The net result was a $6.6 million increase in overall usage per customer.",
         "Next, on the table, you will see that the increase in residential sales was offset by a $3.1 million decrease in our fixed cost adjustment revenues.",
         "Moving further down the table. Our retail revenues per megawatt hour were down $1.5 million, partly due to the timing of rate recovery associated with our power cost adjustment mechanism. And also, Idaho Power\u2019s open access tariff rates declined by 13% in October of 2019. This rate decrease lowered transmission wheeling related revenues by $1 million.",
         "Next on the table, other operating and maintenance expenses decreased by $3.9 million, primarily due to the temporary deferral of some maintenance projects at Idaho Power\u2019s jointly owned generation plant. We expect this maintenance to be completed later in 2020 or in 2021 as the timing of the maintenance is discretionary. You\u2019ll note later that we continue to expect full year O&M expenses to be in line with 2019 and our prior guidance.",
         "Earlier this month, the Idaho Commission issued an order granting utilities the authority to defer unanticipated emergency related expenses due to the COVID-19 public health crisis, net of any cost savings for possible recovery through future rates. As such, in the second quarter, Idaho Power recorded a $0.6 million regulatory asset for its initial estimate of those costs, including higher bad debt expense, net of estimated savings, such as vehicle fuel and employee travel and training.",
         "The changes collectively netted to an increased Idaho Power\u2019s operating income of $7.5 million. Overall, Idaho Power\u2019s and IDACORP\u2019s second quarter net income were $7.7 million and $7.2 million higher than last year, respectively, while net income for the first half of 2020 was $2.1 million higher than last year at IDACORP.",
         "IDACORP and Idaho Power continue to maintain strong balance sheets, including investment-grade credit ratings and sound liquidity, which enabled us to fund ongoing capital expenditures and dividend payments. I mentioned last quarter that we successfully closed a 30-year bond offering that brought approximately $260 million of cash proceeds to Idaho Power, priced at a reoffer yield of 3.42%. The proceeds of that issuance address long-term liquidity needs and will be used to retire next week a $100 million bond set to mature later this year.",
         "In June this quarter, we issued a separate $80 million 10-year bond at a 1.9% coupon, the proceeds of which were used earlier this week to redeem prior to maturity $75 million in bonds that had been set to mature in 2022 at a 2.95% coupon.",
         "This bond redemption included a modest make-whole premium that will result in a slight tax benefit in the third quarter this year. We are pleased with the outcomes of these two issuances and believe both Idaho Power and IDACORP are in strong liquidity positions. These financings also lowered Idaho Power\u2019s long-term cost of debt rate. IDACORP\u2019s operating cash flows along with our liquidity positions as of the end of the second quarter are included on Slide 6.",
         "Cash flows from operations were about $37 million lower than the first six months of 2019. The decrease was mostly related to the timing of net collections of regulatory assets and liabilities, especially those resulting from the power cost adjustment mechanism.",
         "The liquidity available under IDACORP\u2019s and Idaho Power\u2019s credit facilities is shown on the middle of Slide 6. At this time, we do not anticipate issuing additional equity this year other than the relatively nominal amounts under our compensation plan. You\u2019ll note that including the current cash positions at IDACORP and Idaho Power, as of July 29, we have access to liquidity of approximately $200 million and $494 million, respectively, net of amounts to be used for debt retirements in the third quarter. While cash flows have been minimally affected thus far, our combined liquidity along with expected regulatory support from our annual adjustment mechanisms is a substantial backstop to our expected capital and operating needs.",
         "As planned, Idaho Power contributed $20 million to its pension plan during the first seven months of this year and has no further required additional contributions during 2020. We currently plan to contribute an additional $20 million to the plan, but have flexibility depending on market conditions and cash flows, including any effects of the health crisis.",
         "Slide 7 shows our reaffirmed full year 2020 earnings guidance and our key financial and operating metrics estimates. While it remains difficult to predict the long-term pandemic related impact on economic conditions, and thus, on our earnings guidance range, we continue to expect IDACORP\u2019s 2020 earnings to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 per diluted share. Our guidance continues to assume no use of additional tax credits and normal weather conditions going forward.",
         "Our strong, consistent financial results and sustained cost management efforts during the past decade have preserved the full $45 million of tax credits available to support our current minimum Idaho jurisdictional return on equity of 9.4%, and we are continuing our efforts to preserve them going forward. Other than the refined expectation of hydropower generation to the range of 6.5 million to 7.5 million megawatt hours, the remaining full year financial and operating metric forecasts are consistent with what we originally provided back in February and affirmed back in April.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call to Lisa."

         "Remarks": [
            "Well, Chris, as you know, third quarter is our big quarter. It\u2019s half our year typically, maybe more. And so what happens in third quarter has usually an outsized effect on the whole year. As we are rolling right now, it feels like very little changed from the start. We\u2019ve \u2013 on the economic front, it doesn\u2019t seem to have slowed at all. Now whether \u2013 how long that goes is a question. But certainly, in this moment, things are \u2013 our people are as busy as ever. The state has been through some different phases of opening and reclosing a bit.",
            "I would say that it feels to us that at least this current state we\u2019re in has found a way to function with this going on. I think fall is going to bring some additional challenges with schools and other things coming back. But that\u2019s one of the reasons that, at this point, we\u2019re just leaving the range a little wider than we have at some point. Sometimes we\u2019ve narrowed in second. It just didn\u2019t feel like the year to do that. But we have factored in normal weather, basically, the rest of the year. We have factored in what we know about how we have responded thus far, and I think it\u2019s been pretty effective.",
            "As far as an uptick or down, if you know something there that we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re reading everything we see, but I don\u2019t think we can predict that it\u2019s better or worse. I\u2019d say it\u2019s more of an existence in the state we\u2019re in today probably is closest to what\u2019s rolling out."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Right. Is that, your lack of significant economic impact, due to the nature of the heavy ag component of your economy?"

         "Speaker": "Chris Ellinghaus"
      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I think that\u2019s part of it. And certainly, the things going on for us through the summer, the next two months are going to be the biggest thing. So that kind of predates your period that you\u2019re talking about in terms of some sort of a resurgence or a different level of impact in the fall. So that part is likely going to roll on with whatever it is. As you know, temperature can help us if it gets really hot. Occasionally, we get a rate differential that we give back \u2013 or we \u2013 we kind of bear the risks. If we have customers use an abnormally high amount, we \u2013 or I guess, we get some benefit out of that. If it goes really low, if it\u2019s way below normal, then we run the risk of losing some because our adjustment mechanisms tend to use averages. So when something is way off the average, it has a different effect. Right now, it\u2019s feeling hot. And we\u2019re hoping that this brings us some good benefit, but we don\u2019t plan on that when we step into the quarter."

We\u2019re giving you the look at what it did forecast, what we forecasted, what actuals were and then weather-adjusted event to show you that there were some weather impacts. You can see that. There were some periods there where the weather probably drove \u2013 helped drive it a little bit higher, and it comes down a bit with the weather adjustment.

So this is the best quantification we can give you. And I think it\u2019s why we put the whole thing in this time. And we had \u2013 the two biggest areas that have been hit are certainly the industrial and commercial. But \u2013 and residential has kind of been an offset the other way. And that is \u2013 as the move-ins come, there\u2019s just so many new things coming that it\u2019s hard to get a feel exactly how much is higher use amongst our own customers and the blend because it is \u2013 they\u2019re coming at us pretty fast right now."

So \u2013 and really, it was when the phase was entered where the bars opened again, to be quite honest, and more \u2013 large gatherings were allowed. So as you know, it\u2019s a very difficult political issue for many. We certainly are \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of county by county, entity by entity requirements that are being added like mask wearing, for example. So right now, we\u2019re holding in Phase 4. So those large gatherings are not allowed yet. Different cities have further increased the requirements. And so it is kind of a patchwork across Idaho. We\u2019re hopeful that last week, it sort of had tailed \u2013 or not tailed off, but it had flattened, and we\u2019re seeing it sort of grow again.",

I hear more people talking about it. So I\u2019m hopeful, but we haven\u2019t really seen the data that would suggest it\u2019s turning the corner yet."

On the irrigation, it did look \u2013 I would say that, that didn\u2019t seem to be drastically different based on anything with the pandemic. I think people planted the way they were planning to plant. Irrigation season does, while it runs all the way into, some things will be irrigating into the fall. There is a pretty good drop off as you move from June into July and then from July into August, it kind of steps down. But that\u2019s all following, I would say, a fairly normal trajectory.",
            "June, which would have been, looking backwards, if you go through the quarter, June would have had the best opportunity, I think, from a weather standpoint in really all categories. And of the three months, June was the one that was probably the least helpful because we had a lot of water and a little cooler temperatures in June. April and May had us pretty hopeful. They were kind of the other way. It\u2019s just bigger use. So, what we\u2019ve got set up here going forward is that now things are more in the months where you get some irrigation, you tend to get higher results out of residential customers. And it feels like temperatures and the precipitation are more on the normal and to the dry and hot side. So, I\u2019d say that gives us some hope. We\u2019ll have to watch as we go through the quarter. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color there."

I think they\u2019re moving forward on their side with some of the filings this fall. I was just curious on just Bridger expectations and process there. Just sort of status quo, I presume, but would be curious if any updates. And then I\u2019ll throw the other question out there at the same time. As you think about the transmission wheeling revenues, I know you talked about it in the results here, just \u2013 should you expect any kind of oscillations with that year-over-year as you think about the comps in \u2013 just in light of COVID? I know that could drive various impacts."

We are, as you may know, and it was in the filing, looking at our IRP. The bottom line is, at this time, we\u2019ve run some analysis, and it appears that our preferred portfolio will remain the preferred portfolio. But the short story is, in June, we discovered a few modifications and inputs that we wanted to make. We\u2019re making those inputs right now and rerunning the models and so we\u2019ll see where Bridger ends up. But for purposes of right now and what we\u2019re seeing, it appears that the preferred portfolio we put in IRP is, as it relates to Bridger, are still the dates we\u2019re looking at in the future.

Certainly, last year\u2019s results were up because of the Enbridge Gas pipeline rupture and sort of the then ensuing market shifts that happened that we were able to take advantage of. But transmission is cyclical. Lots of things can happen and as sort of more markets open up, I think there is opportunities for that to go up, but it is very seasonal. It is very weather dependent and sort of just a combination of whatever else is going on. So, I don\u2019t know that I would say it necessarily has a cyclical nature that we could predict, but we watch it carefully."

And so we have seen volumes increase in that regard. But to Lisa\u2019s point, it\u2019s a little bit difficult at this time to predict where it\u2019s going. The market in general has been low from a price perspective. So I\u2019d say overall, volumes have been relatively flat, but moving up in Q2."

We knew that wasn\u2019t likely to repeat at that level. So we\u2019ve used the more normalized level of expectation. We did use the lower rates that were put in last that we knew were going to be in effect in October. So that side, I would say, we\u2019re pretty cautious.",

Certainly, if we have a hotter than normal and the dryer-than-normal month or two, that\u2019s likely to give us a little bit of help and that would be a lift. We\u2019re going to keep our eye on \u2013 you noticed the \u2013 we had a maintenance deferral that came up this quarter that helped. But for the year, we don\u2019t know if it will hit 2020 or 2021. That one has potential if it slides clear it\u2019s 2021, we would get some help out of that as well. Things like that are probably what we\u2019d look to.",

We\u2019ve had \u2013 as you saw, the bond transactions were helpful. They\u2019ve kind of helped though cover some of the things that we didn\u2019t count on, like the cost of dealing with the pandemic and PPE and all those things. So it\u2019s been a little bit of a push me pull you thus far. We\u2019re hoping we\u2019re moving into a phase when we could just get some good and hang on to it. But that\u2019s why we left guidance basically where it was. I think we feel like we\u2019re in a good place. We have hopes for the rest of the year, as I pointed out to Chris, that third quarter is our big quarter. So if we can get that one right, it usually helps the whole year."

This one happened to be in the few million-dollar range that \u2013 they\u2019re managing COVID there, too. And the impact of contractors in and out, and it became obvious in here second quarter that they were moving some things that would have started then.

That would be one that \u2013 what I\u2019m telling you is, for our plan, we\u2019re sticking with our original guidance. So we haven\u2019t grabbed that and said that\u2019s an absolute win. We think it\u2019s too early to commit to that. We\u2019ll keep watching it. Hopefully, by the end of third quarter, we know more whether that one has potential to help.

We certainly all have thought it might be going a different way by now so that it might be \u2013 you might be seeing more of the upsides coming of getting back and things recovering.

It\u2019s \u2013 because that was in our plan originally.

Our longer numbers went up just a little bit, and we don\u2019t really see that ending. I mean even we thought it might slow with the pandemic. And I\u2019m not sure it hasn\u2019t fed up the people trying to get into Idaho. So it\u2019s just that we\u2019re being careful and cautious there and making sure that we are positioned well, capital wise. With the pandemic hit, we also wanted to have enough to get through the summer. So we did do it probably earlier than we would have done otherwise. But I think it\u2019s all really good. We\u2019re not way beyond what our normal plan was anyway. We\u2019re really kind of on the plan, just we\u2019re ahead of the game, and we\u2019ve got some really good rates with it. So I think it\u2019s a good place to be."

            "Okay. Got it. And then when I look at the cash balance of $460 million in the second quarter of 2020, it seems like you have quite a bit of excess liquidity. And even with the refinancing of debt in the third quarter this year, you\u2019re still going to be left with quite a bit of cash at the end of 2020, which seems to be kind of the consistent theme with you guys over the last several years.",

            "Right. The dividend is \u2013 we made some statements last year of what we expected to do, and we haven\u2019t faltered on that. We have the same expectations today. Again, that\u2019s our policy getting ahead. This \u2013 we decide \u2013 we borrowed this year, that\u2019s really to carry us through next year. I think instead we would have done it later in the year, most likely, had we not had the pandemic, but we didn\u2019t. And interest rates also got really favorable, which pulled us in early. But we\u2019ve tried to do that. About every other year, we\u2019ve not only handled our refinancings that were required, we\u2019ve tried to borrow a little bit extra so that we could stay a little bit ahead of our capital needs that were coming in the following year, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done again.",
            "So that number goes down back to my third quarter comment of how big it is, the spend is really big as we move into these quarters as well. Most of our construction, the big items are rolling out right now, and we\u2019ll see the impacts of that show up over the next quarter as well. Good news is we\u2019ll hopefully have positive revenues to help out with that. But it is a safer spot, I would say, but we will \u2013 it\u2019s not way different than what we had planned."

            "Yes. We\u2019ve always just said around 50%, and we got several big projects in the work that we\u2019re not spending on, but that are coming. And I think that we\u2019re a little bit rich against that. Today is more of \u2013 we know that\u2019s coming. And when we get those opportunities, we\u2019re going to be able to do that with, we think, really low cost debt financing. I think we\u2019ll not probably need to push additional equity through the early phases as those kick in and we start to spend.",
            "So, it\u2019s actually a really \u2013 in my opinion, it\u2019s a really defensive place to be. And we\u2019ll have minimal impacts when we do get that bigger CapEx. And we didn\u2019t talk a ton about them on this call, but people are pushing ahead on Boardman to Hemingway, were pushing ahead on Hells Canyon. And there are going to be things coming at us that are going to add. We\u2019ve shown you guys some of our increased CapEx story. It\u2019s just not here this minute. But we don\u2019t wait until we get there to think about it. So we\u2019re really ahead of that a bit. And the good news is we\u2019ll fix that with debt when we get there. That\u2019s the cheapest way to do it."

It was 0.7%. But going into 2020, Moody\u2019s was suggesting closer to 5% GDP growth for 2020. So the swing is still significant. Obviously, not a lot, not as wide as the national swings that we\u2019ve seen, but certainly going from close to 5% at the beginning of the year to a negative 3.8% now is a big difference."
