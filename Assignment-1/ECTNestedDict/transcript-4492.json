         "Good morning, everybody. And thank you very much for I guess logging in as opposed to being in the room. We were hoping we'd be in Boston for the 13th Annual Global Transportation Conference hosted by Cowen, and it's being held in conjunction with the first Annual Mobility Conference. I'm Helane Becker, the Managing Director at Cowen and Senior Airline Analyst. And this morning, we are so fortunate to have with us American Airlines leadership team, some of the leadership team. We have Robert Isom, President of American Airlines; Derek Kerr, CFO; and Vasu, Revenue Management. I know I didn't get anybody's -- I probably got nobody's title correct. So, Robert, I'll let you fix that. ",
         "Do you want to make a few remarks before we kick off the Q&A?"
      ],
      "Robert Isom": [
         "That'd be great, Helane. Thanks, again. [indiscernible] a few things. And yes, we have Derek Kerr, our CFO here; and Vasu Raja, who heads up our revenue, Chief Revenue Officer for American Airlines. So great to be here this morning. Good morning, everybody. And Helane, thanks again for the opportunity to be here. This is always a great event, even when it's disappointing a virtual event. Hopefully that's something that we can correct for next year. ",
         "Before we get into questions, I want to provide the latest America\u2019s ongoing response to the crisis we and the entire airline industry are facing. It goes without saying that we have never encountered such a significant challenge but the American Airlines team is doing an outstanding job of leading through the crisis to ensure we are well-positioned on the other side when demand does recover, and it will. ",
         "In the face of unprecedented adversity and uncertainty, American team members are doing amazing work to take care of our customers and each other. We are tremendously proud of what they continue to do every day in the midst of difficult circumstances. I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the news that we had to share with our team two weeks ago. The need for involuntary staffing reductions starting in October, which we worked really hard to mitigate as many of these reductions as possible through voluntary leave and early out programs. With absent an extension of the Payroll Support Program, 19,000 of our team members will be involuntarily furloughed, or separated from the company on October 1st. This is news that we never wanted to share with our team. But it is the reality that we're facing, we must confront it. ",
         "As we continue to manage the crisis, we remain focused on three areas, building up cash, reducing cost to conserve the cash that we do use, and adjusting the way that we operate the airlines that our customers can return with complete confidence when they\u2019re ready. American ended the second quarter with $10.2 billion of available liquidity which included a net $3.6 billion raised during the quarter through the capital markets. We continue to expect to close on the government loan by the end of this month. ",
         "In addition, we announced two senior secured note transactions with Goldman Sachs totaling $1.2 billion. Our daily cash burn rate came down considerably in the second quarter from approximately $100 million per day in April to $56 million per day in May to $30 million per day in June. The improvement was largely driven by our aggressive cost actions. In total, we have removed approximately $16.5 billion from our operating and capital budgets for 2020.",
         "We continue to expect our third quarter burn rates to be below our second quarter rates and our fourth quarter rates to be lower than our third quarter rates. Our goal remains to be cash positive in 2021 as demand for air travel gradually improves. In line with previous guidance, we expect to end the third quarter with approximately $13 billion of available liquidity assuming no additional financing activity for the remainder of the quarter. We moved quickly to size the airline for the demand that we're seeing. Our flown capacity was down approximately 60% year-over-year in July and August and we expect it to be down approximately 60% in September as well. We continue to evaluate our future capacity plans. And based on current projections, we expect our fourth quarter capacity to be down more than 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. There's still pent up demand for air travel and we're seeing some gradual improvement since our last earnings call. But it's fair to say that we're still planning for a slow recovery.",
         "We've taken additional steps in recent weeks to give our customers confidence as they return to the skies. We've upgraded our clean commitment by adding the electrostatic spraying solution SurfaceWise2 to our cleaning and safety program. SurfaceWise2 is approved by the EPA as the first ever long lasting product to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus and it will be applied to American\u2019s entire fleet in the coming months. The actions we're taking to ensure the safety and well-being of our team and customers are working. While we're operating a much smaller airline than we did this time last year, American\u2019s 100,000 team members are still transporting millions of customers each month. We are seeing the lowest levels of COVID-19 infection rates among our team since the start of the pandemic. ",
         "Even with our team members being on the frontlines and working throughout the pandemic to support our communities and serve our customers, our team has a lower rate of COVID-19 infection compared to the national average. Notably, we've seen fewer cases of our customer facing team members that are affected, such as our flight attendants and customer service agents than other work groups at American Airlines.",
         "We've also made travel easier and less complicated for our customers by eliminating change fees for most domestic and short haul international flying. Additionally, we are giving customers the ability to fly stand-by on earlier flights on the same day at no charge. These are new customer-friendly initiatives along with changes to our basic economy fares and the new advantage elite benefits that give American\u2019s travelers even more flexibility when they fly. ",
         "We still have a long road ahead of us and a lot of difficult work, but our team remains fully engaged and focused on getting through the crisis. And we're confident that through the dedication of our team and the actions that we've taken and will take, American will emerge in a strong competitive position. ",
         "So, Helane, that\u2019s some opening comments. And happy to take any questions."

            "Thanks, Robert. That was like a lot of information in a few short sentences. So thank you for -- actually for saying all of that. So a couple of things. As I look at this TSA numbers and hear you say you have millions of passengers and everyday people I know travel, they feel compelled to send me e-mails about their flights. And I'm sure you get similar e-mails from your friends and family about how they're packed, which is a good thing. Like when people say my American Airlines flight is packed, my response is -- and is that a bad thing? I think we want your flights to be packed. So, a lot of questions in there. How do you think about like going into this winter since this year was nothing like we anticipated when we all returned to work on January 2nd? How do you think about the winter and coming out of the pandemic and kind of winning the recovery? Because I think we're starting to think about shifting to that. So, when I look at TSA numbers, do I say 20% of that is American or do you have a greater share of that? Because maybe you're less exposed to New York and the Northeast where there's been low -- fewer travelers? So, we'll start with that question. "

      "2": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So, a lot in that question -- Vasu can help me out. Helane, your comments and the folks that you interact with, they see the same thing I do, which is, look, I fly every week and flights are getting fuller. But remember, we have a limited portion of our schedule that we fly, and we're coming off of a second quarter that don't -- remember where revenue was down 87%. So, we're building off of a really, really depressed base and we're doing our best to match capacity for demand. What I\u2019d tell you is, as we take a look at the future, while we do see gradual improvement in bookings and hopefully it\u2019s sustainable, it's still too soon to tell. So, the key for us is flexibility. And that is, at the end of the day how we intend to come out of this very strong. We have to take some really decisive actions now to get our cost structure aligned for the future. But as we see more in terms of what comes back in terms of leisure -- and again, Vasu can give us more color on that, leisure travelers, and hopefully some business travelers coming back too, we'll make sure that we're ready to accommodate them. "

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And Helane, I\u2019d just elaborate around two points. First, you were alluding to the question, how much of the bookings that we're seeing is just kind of geographically where our network is versus something that we're doing. And then two, how we're thinking about it, as you described it, winning the recovery. [Indiscernible] I like the way you phrase that. So the first one, look, it\u2019s no doubt that a disproportion amount of the benefit but -- the travel is coming back, benefits American Airlines because Sun Belt markets, Florida, Texas, Arizona and places like that are seeing a greater rebound in bookings after they come off of their highs in both COVID counts and case growth. And of course, our network is disproportionately concentrated in the Sun Belt and it\u2019s still relatively small in the Coast that we do see a benefit from that. But the thing which we have endeavored to do is preserve the connectivity of our network as much as anything. ",
            "So, pre-COVID, our two biggest connecting complexes in Dallas Fort Worth and Charlotte might have been 40% of the airline. Now they're running something like 55% to 60% of the airline. And as we go through the winter -- and it\u2019s pretty reasonable to think that those percentages are likely to continue. And to Robert\u2019s very important point, added to that, we try to be as flexible as possible. So, we've changed a number of our processes where before we built a schedule of 120 days out, now we can build and revise a schedule between 75 days in the time it flies or 45 days, which is when our crew is [indiscernible] on the schedule. We have a range of tools, even to work on schedule after it is closed for crews that are driving a lot of incremental costs. So, maintaining that flexibility is key. And that's where you see us coming into market like Austin to Cancun or Indianapolis to Cancun. That's not necessarily a long-term reflection of what American Airlines might do, but a short-term response to things that we see. ",
            "And then your second point about, as you phrased it, winning the recovery. One of the things that we've been -- it\u2019s unfortunate, we flew a much harder schedule in June, but one of the benefits we got out of that, we got to see a lot of customers fly on the airplane. And what\u2019s interesting for us because our customer mix very much shifted, where we still lost maybe -- 20 points of our revenue mix historically was coming from customers that were 40 -- over 40 years of age and traveling disproportionately for business even in the summer, and it shifted to people who were under 40 years of age, many of whom had no [status] [ph] on the airline at all, and were traveling disproportionately for leisure, or at least a mix of leisure and business. They were leaving on a Monday, coming back on a Thursday coming to [indiscernible] on a beach. And so for us, as we think about, let\u2019s call it, winning the recovery, a big part of it is acknowledging that the customer is changing. And historically, the network airline business was really leveraged around a small percentage of customers, who flew disproportionately for business. Those customers are also more likely to be older in demographic scale, live in the coast; in short, less likely to come back to travel until we are deeply [indiscernible] vaccine penetration. But there's people out there right now, and so we need to build a relationship with them. And a lot of how we're thinking about as you call it winning the recovery is bringing new customers to air travel and graduating them to higher tiers of loyalty."

         "Remarks": [
            "I want to come back to that because I think that's really important. But I want to ask Derek a question first. And that's, when we look at your balance sheet, you've got about $50 billion in debt at the end of the second quarter. I know you have nothing to do until I think you said on the last earnings call the first quarter of 2022. But when I look at $1.5 billion of interest expense before you bring any money to the bottom-line, and of course, you're not in a tax paying position, how should we think about you getting that balance sheet in under control again, as you shrink the airline to the new level of demand and maybe have to furlough some folks next month with that debt position? That I know, I mean we talked a little bit about it on the earnings call in the second quarter. I mean, I know that, that is 3% or lower debt, so it's good cost. So how should we think about that? That question comes up a lot from investors. I'm sure you are sick of answering it. But Derek I have to ask it, I guess."

         "Remarks": [
            "No, no, it's what -- I mean that's what we have to do [indiscernible] before. I mean the two things we have to do today as we go forward, right, is to lower the cash burn and make sure it's down as low as it can be. And that's looking at all CapEx whether it's non-aircraft, aircraft CapEx. So there's still work to do in those areas going forward as we continue to work with our suppliers and things that as we move forward. And then it is to try to turn this airline as Vasu was talking about into cash positive as soon as possible, right? All of that cash will go to pay off the debt, we will continue to drive down the CapEx needs of the airline and use all that cash to go to pay off debt. ",
            "So as I said, we have a period of time, we have a $750 million convert that's due in June of 2022. And we have nothing until 2023. So we have a long period of time to be able to do that. And that's what we have to focus on. So it really is incumbent on us, number one to get the cash burn down and get us as positive cash as possible, and then use every bit of cash that we have in order to pay off the debt. There may got to be some rebalancing of the balance sheet, right? I mean, we did a equity deal, and a convert deal in the big [bang] [ph] that we did just a month and a half -- two months ago. There may have to be more of that as we move forward to rebalance the balance sheet and to pay that off. But we've set it up pretty well now. We've got it pushed out two or three years. ",
            "So what we're working on right now is, number one, the cash side of things; and number two, the capital side of things to make sure that we free up every bit of cash flow that we have to pay off the debt over time. I mean, you know we were set up as we move forward to pay off $8 billion to $10 billion worth of debt over the next four to five years, that's still going to happen, because a lot of that's aircraft debt as it comes due and we pay it off. So, unfortunately we're starting from a higher base, but we need it to get through this pandemic. And hopefully what we're doing is not tying ourselves up with long-term -- as you can see, we haven't done a lot of long-term high cost debt to move forward. We've kind of stayed back a little bit on that and we're trying to manage that portion of it, so that when we come out of this, we just pay off the aircraft stuff that\u2019s coming due and try to drive that down. But there will be some rebalancing of the balance sheet that we have to do over the next few years. The good part is we have time to do that."

            "So, Vasu, I want to go back to the Loyalty program a little bit, with respect to two things or maybe three things. So, the first question is, as you think about Loyalty shifting more to leisure from business, is there a point in time where, let's say, business traffic starts to come back a year or so from now, you shift back to business and annoy your newly found leisure customers, or do you maintain -- is there a way to maintain the focus on both? And then the other question may be more short-term focused is, as we look ahead to the holidays, I'm kind of thinking fourth quarter revenue might be higher than third quarter. How are you guys thinking about that?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Helane Becker"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Great questions, Helane. I'll take them sequentially. Look, to the first one, no, absolutely not, like being able to deliver a product for what\u2019s predominantly leisure-oriented travel right now in no way precludes us to -- from being able to deliver a business-oriented travel in the future on a number of different levels, right? First and foremost, historically in this business, even through the worst of crisis, the great financial crises, post 9/11, we've never struggled for traffic, right? We\u2019ve always -- within a few quarters of every crisis, airlines posted pretty good load factors. The real issue in those past crises was generating a halo. In this crisis it equates to demand, right, where this could be non-attractive to unfill the airplanes. And so, for us, it causes us to really re-think how we approach leisure and business. And if you look at it historically, primarily through our Loyalty program, we would disproportionately reward you when you move for business. But if, for example, if you move for leisure with your family, those benefits would be a lot different. We\u2019re now increasingly -- when you think about it, how we think of the customers as a customer, not as a period transaction. And looked at like that, you will see a lot of different patterns starting to emerge, right? We see people who are -- like I mentioned earlier, who were traveling almost seems like a business travel pattern but they go to leisure markets. ",
            "And so we think that\u2019s one that will -- the more and more we can understand the customer and not just the transaction, more better we can go and plan on the network. So we see already that being able to -- there are some things which are just getting out of wheelhouse, being able to offer the connectivity, DFW, Charlotte, Chicago really, really worked for us. But then there's other things that we're seeing really emerge out there, which are very promising for us, TX has been posting really, really great load factors, and a lot of it is people going to each of the destination. So as Robert mentioned, airline is flexible as possible and more we can understand the customer, the more the airline network will change and more of the Loyalty program will change such that we can get a disproportionate share of wallet of the actual customer and that will enable us to go serve both a leisure-oriented travel pattern and a business-oriented travel pattern.

      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And Helane to that point as well, while the business traffic is up 95% or more, one of the things that we do see is that a lot of the leisure travel actually comes from folks that would otherwise be covered under their corporate contracts. So while many corporate headquarters are shut down, those team members for those companies are actually taking some leisure trips. And so we maintain a connection to them, through our Loyalty program. As Vasu mentioned, it's really important to ensure that they receive the same type of treatment as they find leisure, as they would under the old corporate contracts. "

      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Absolutely. And further to that, Helane may be the last comment to that point. Also, coming out of here, we envision creating a much more seamless experience across all of our partners, not just newly formed partnerships like with Alaska and JetBlue but even with longstanding partners, IAG, GOL, partners, because we're going to be a relatively smaller airline, but it's so much our partners networks are strong and major, major population and major business travel, and the more we can really deliver a seamless level of benefit, right? I think we're if you're an executive flying on American Airlines, you can get an upgrade across our global network. The more we can do that, the more we'll be responsive to that customers as they come back. ",
            "To your second question about fourth quarter versus third quarter revenue, I think Robert alluded to in his comments. We're seeing some promising signs out there, but it's still really, really early to call. And we've seen promising signs in the past, in the late May, early June timeframe. So last few weeks we have had a good clip of bookings, but the major thing for us to keep the airline as flexible as possible. We are very fortunate, we're benefited maybe disproportionately by the fact that we have really big complexes in places that are -- so far have been more resilient to COVID but we'll see how it comes together as we sit here, maybe spring and that\u2019s early to go and prognosticate very much on the fourth quarter."

            "We are not sorry at all that we did this. Our loan will be LIBOR plus 350 is the government loan. And we're at 4.75 billion right now. We know that Southwest is not taking the loan, they've already announced they're not taking the loan. So there may be possibility to do that. So I think in this environment, I'm not sure exactly where the others are going to come out on their loan, but that loan is going to be somewhere in the 7% to 8% range or 9% range if we went out and did that today. So, you talked about the balance sheet -- you talked about the balance sheet earlier, right? It's a much better for that liquidity to be a LIBOR plus 350 than it is at 3%, 3.5%, 4% than is an 8%, cut the interest expense by half.",
            "So I'm not upset about it at all. I think it's an option later. At some point in time, you have to take that loan out, so it'll be an option at a later point in time. So, we've been working really well with the Treasury Department and PJT has done a great job. And I think we'll be happy that we got that done at the rate that it's at versus trying to go to the market today. We will at some point in time -- others are going to go to the market soon to do a transaction like that. It'll be an option for us. But at this point in time where things are, it\u2019d be way more expensive, and it just -- we don't need to put that big expensive debt on the balance sheet at this point in time. "

            "That makes perfect sense, actually, when you put it that way for us to think about it in that regard. So here's another question. Robert, last year at our conference we talked about the MAX and when it might return to service. I mean it\u2019s still not back, it's okay. It's still not back. I always say this about myself. I seamlessly went on CNBC earlier this year and said I didn't think you could turn the world off. And it turns out a month later, I went on CNBC and I said, well, turns out I was wrong, you can shut down the world. So here we are a year later. And the MAX is still on the ground. So a few things, I know that, you've made some big fleet decisions recently, and you've retired a lot of older aircraft, so you have like a good guy in the sense that your carbon footprint is going to be lower I think going forward, and maybe you accelerate the time where you achieve your sustainability and your carbon goals. So maybe we can talk about that. But maybe we can talk about the MAX also in the context of renegotiating the agreement with Boeing and pushing deliveries out or does that not make sense? "

         "Remarks": [
            "So I can take, Derek can help me out as well. So hey, the first thing in regard to carbon footprint and we all know this, the fastest, the best way to reduce carbon emissions is to burn less fuel. And the way you burn less fuel is by having the newest engines and airframes you possibly can. American Airlines is far superior to our other network competitors in terms of fleet renewal. And so as Derek talked about the debt load that we have right now, it\u2019s largely a result of that fleet renewal program that we brought in 500 plus new aircraft that we're going to be using for hopefully the next decade, which is good news for American.",
            "And so I feel like we've done a nice job in terms of making sure that we're out in front of the industry on what really counts in terms of carbon emissions in that new aircraft. Along with everything else from offering our customers the option to purchase offsets, to work that we've done recently with sustainable jet fuels and things like that as well. So, I feel good about that. ",
            "And then in terms of our fleet plan, as you suggested, a lot of the work that we did was to fast forward plan to create as an efficient fleet as possible, not just around fuel burn, but also in terms of the friction cost of training pilots and mechanics and maintenance spaces. And so, by getting our fleet rationalized, our main line fleet, down to really four aircraft types. So, two wide body flavors and two narrow body flavors, we've dramatically simplified the airline in terms of maintenance, in terms of flight operations and pilot training. And so, I really look forward to being able to benefit from that. And that is something illustrates that we didn't have the benefit of before. So, that will serve us well, and part of that solution is having the 737 around and the new variance 737 MAX when it is back flying, it\u2019s going to meet fuel efficiency targets. It will be the safest aircraft that is flying and it will be used very well in American fleet."

We're supposed to have 60 by the end of the next year. We're working with Boeing and our partners to look at those. We don't have anything to announce yet. I hope to have something announced by earnings call timeframe of exactly what you're talking about, which is making sure that all of those 18 that still need to be delivered are financed, number one. And then the other 18, is there a flexibility in those 18 that are supposed to be coming in '21 and '22. Can we get deferral rights or something to push those out a little bit farther? So, we are looking at that, that goes back to the balance sheet again, reducing the cash flow and reducing the CapEx that we have requirements over the next couple of years. So, I hope to have something more earnings call timeframe, but that's the goal that we have as we move forward is to make sure, number one, all the planes that come in are financed. And number two, some of them that we have the ability to shift delivery positions, can we shift delivery positions out a little bit farther."

They're talking about shipping vaccines around, and obviously you need to have cold storage for that, and I know most of the airlines don't have cold -- specific cold storage for pharmaceuticals. But I know cargo is a big part of your business recently. I mean it's always like small percentage. But would you be able to participate in any of that moving drugs around when -- or vaccines so that we can get vaccinated in a timely fashion? Do you know that? It's not meant to be a trick question."

            "Again, I can start and Vasu can give some more color as well. So just first off, we're getting the network ready to be able to support, and part of that is just through the normal daily traffic that goes throughout the network with passenger planes. But we're also -- we have -- in the month of September, we're planning on having a 1,000 dedicated cargo charter flights where no passengers, just belly cargo and serving some really important markets. But I will underscore that American, because of our presence on the East Coast, namely Philadelphia as being a pharmaceutical center within the U.S., we've positioned ourselves over the years to have the kind of cold storage, not just cold storage but also the containers that would be required as well. So, we're going to be ready to help the country and we're going to be -- make sure that American is very well positioned to take advantage of any type of opportunities that are out there. Vasu?"

            "Yes, absolutely right. The only thing I would add is that the cargo -- this cargo business that we've been in lately is just another kind of opportunity thing we've done in the last quarter crisis. In March -- we hadn't run a decade of cargo charters since like 1984. And now we're doing a 1,000 a month and growing all the time. So, we don't think that cargo is probably going to be a self-sustaining business. Obviously we are going to have dedicated cargo freighters. But there is a pretty promising world out there and one that also favors American because of our cold storage and it\u2019s really -- and what really is the nexus for so much global pharma. So we're starting to plan for that -- prepare for that, and that could be a promising thing as we think about winning the recovery. "

But thank you so much for participating in our conference this year. Hopefully next year we'll be back in Boston this -- I feel like my walls are closing in on me, but maybe I can come visit you guys in Dallas. Thanks very much. Time to say goodbye. Thank you."
