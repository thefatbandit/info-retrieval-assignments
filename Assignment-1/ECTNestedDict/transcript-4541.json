         "Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. I'm going to start with Slide 11 and the discussion of our adjusted operating EBITDA margin results. As you might expect, the drop in volume had impacts throughout our system and these margin drivers. Volume, which we measure at the gross profit level and is netted against the impact of net pricing drove a decline of 1,670 basis points in the second quarter. This reflects the 52% decline in sales versus prior year, only slightly mitigated by positive net pricing as our January price increases have mostly held up in the quarter.",
         "Material costs, including tariffs, was a 250 basis point headwind this quarter compared to prior year. This comparison reflects a 60 basis point benefit we received in last year's second quarter from a favorable ruling on the application of the Section 301 tariffs on certain products that were being imported from China. In addition, we faced some new tariffs that began to impact us in 2019 and finally we saw inbound freight rates increase in the quarter due to capacity adjustments as carriers responded to feared COVID disruptions.",
         "On the positive side, mitigating some of these headwinds, we did benefit from some early procurement wins we've achieved through our Transformation Program and see a growing breadth of components coming into our plants at lower cost than a year ago. As our production patterns return to normalcy, we are confident these procurement savings will contribute to margin expansion.",
         "Other manufacturing expenses mainly labor, overhead and warranty were a 250 basis point impact to margin this quarter. We are pleased with how quickly and aggressively we adjusted our production expenses to match the volume declines we experienced this quarter. As Bill mentioned, we implemented one to three week temporary plant closures at the end of March and had sporadic temporary closures at some plants throughout the remainder of the quarter to match production with demand.",
         "We implemented a reduction in force, again at the end of March. It was mostly a pull ahead of actions we planned to take later this year as a result of the improvements we've made in our plants through our Transformation Program. This helped us reduce direct labor almost dollar for dollar with what were sharp declines in demand and thereby maintained the productivity improvements we've made so far despite the lower volume. But there is a degree of fixed cost we could not impact proportionately to volume, causing the margin deleveraging.",
         "We are continuing to execute the Transformation Program related labor strategies across our plants in Q3 and remain encouraged by the progress we see. We're also critically reviewing our other plant cost to ensure we are adjusting to demand and creatively revisiting our structural costs. We expect to continue to take additional restructuring actions in the second half of the year as each plant progresses in its individual Transformation Program.",
         "SG&A on an adjusted basis was down from prior-year quarter by $24 million or 1,180 basis point contributor to margin in the quarter. Like our actions within the manufacturing footprint, on SG&A, we also took early and aggressive actions to contain spending as the pandemic's impact emerged in March. Those actions enabled us to show real favorability in most of the SG&A categories in the quarter.",
         "Employee-related expenses, marketing expenses, travel and professional fees were all favorable. As a reminder, if you're reading the face of the income statement, SG&A includes the Transformation Program investments that are excluded from our adjusted operating EBITDA. You can track the specifics through the non-GAAP reconciliation schedules.",
         "Moving to Slide 12. Free cash flow was a positive $3 million in the quarter. Remember that we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less capital spending, but historically have included unique adjustments for our accounts receivable securitization program that was terminated in March of 2019.",
         "While the 2020 free cash flow has no unique adjustments, 2019 was adjusted for the cash receipts on beneficial interest in sold receivables of $85 million that was reflected as a use of cash in the operating section of the cash flow statement, as well as a source of cash in the same amount in the investing section as we collected the balance of the receivables that were sold prior to the program terminating the prior quarter. This is the last quarter where this adjustment will be in the prior year's quarterly results.",
         "One last reminder on our free cash flow is that it is traditionally a seasonal use of cash in the first quarter as we paid customer rebates to payout annual incentives, build inventory and experienced seasonally lower volumes. We then generate seasonally stronger cash flow in the remaining three quarters. We have averaged approximately $100 million of free cash flow each year since our spin-off, which is a testament to the strong cash flow generation ability inherent in our business. We demonstrated that ability again this quarter by generating positive free cash flow despite seeing sales decline by over 50% in the quarter.",
         "In addition to generating positive EBITDA, we are managing working capital successfully with few, if any, collections challenges and selectively extending payables terms with the support of our vendors. Inventory did rise during the quarter with finished goods up due to some delayed and canceled orders by customers, extra inventory in support of two sourcing changes between our plants and due to the buildup to support increasing ice machine sales.",
         "Raw materials also increased due to materials in transit as demand dropped, coupled with our carrying higher levels of safety stock to manage risk. While we are not providing a free cash flow forecast today, nor expecting it to achieve the levels of the last four years, we believe we've seen the toughest quarter in terms of the pandemic and this adds to our confidence relative to our liquidity.",
         "So touching on liquidity, which we define as cash and short-term investments plus availability on our revolver, we ended the first quarter with $298 million of total liquidity, which is roughly even with where we were at the start of the quarter and as of June, 30 a year ago. Cash and cash equivalents plus restricted cash decreased by $9 million during the quarter, while our overall debt balance decreased by $10 million. We were in compliance with the liquidity EBITDA and capital expenditure covenants in our amended credit agreement with significant headroom.",
         "Finally on Slide 13, I'd like to share a few updated thoughts on 2020. First, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in March and we'll not reinstate it until conditions have sufficiently stabilized. The only guidance we are providing today is that we expect third quarter sales to decrease between 30% and 35% with understandably less clarity than our traditional guidance.",
         "We don't have a fourth quarter nor a full year sales estimate at this time, but we expect that the second quarter will prove to be the worst quarter we'll experience in this crisis. The last thought to share on 2020 is that we are not abandoning our key strategic initiatives but we will balance our transformation investments along with our digital and new product innovation initiatives against what we can afford in the current environment.",
         "As Bill stated, we remain confident that transformation actions are on track and the savings will be realized, but due to the top-line uncertainties and how that interacts with fixed manufacturing costs and SG&A, we cannot, at this time, set a reliable target for achieving the end goal of 500 basis points margin expansion from the 2018 base. But, just trust, we have not lost sight of that goal.",
         "That concludes my comments and operator we'll now open the call up for questions."

         "Good morning and welcome to Welbilt's 2020 second quarter earnings call and webcast. Joining me on the call today is Bill Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marty Agard, our Chief Financial Officer.",

      ],
      "William Johnson": [
         "Thanks, Rich, and good morning. Our people demonstrated a strong sense of resiliency during the second quarter as they remained focused on executing our strategy while dealing with the most difficult conditions ever faced by our industry. We made great progress on our Transformation Program, trained customers, dealers, reps and consultants on how to develop a ghost kitchen and how to improve safety with our enhanced sanitation features that are available with many of our brands.",
         "We're well on our way to developing a continuous improvement culture that is a key success factor in high performing companies and we'll emerge as a stronger company once this crisis abates and business conditions begin to normalize.",
         "Before we get into our second quarter results, I want to review Welbilt's business responses to the COVID pandemic and give you a little more color on the current environment for the commercial foodservice industry.",
         "Starting on Slide 3, you can see some of our responses to the crisis, also which we shared with you last quarter. I'm not going to cover each individual item on the slide, but would point out that our early recognition of the magnitude of this crisis created an urgency within Welbilt to create meaningful responses across our entire company that allowed us to remain profitable and maintain a stable liquidity position in the quarter.",
         "Now that we are in the third quarter and have a little better understanding that the impact from the pandemic will not be over in a couple of quarters, we are taking a narrower set of cost reduction actions in the third quarter to further adjust our cost structure. These actions were made possible by the progress we've made on our Transformation Program and are helping us permanently lock in the productivity improvements achieved to date.",
         "On Slide 4, we have provided some detail on the current market environment. Looking at the MillerPulse weekly same-store sales graph, we can see the recovery in the restaurant market since the historic drop that began in the second week of March. Notable that QSR same-store sales are now above prior year levels. Most QSRs who had more than 50% of their sales come through their drive-through windows prior to the crisis have also now embraced delivery. As a result, they have been more resilient than casual dine-in restaurants. So pre-crisis, saw the majority of their sales tied to dine-in traffic.",
         "We have seen improved interest and activity around restarting some equipment rollouts prospectively speaking more about the next quarter. Casual dine-in restaurants have recovered from seeing same-store sales drop 82% compared to prior year at the end the March to now being down 30%. With the recent rise in COVID-19 cases and some reopenings rolled back in certain location, same-store sales have plateaued since late June. Until no COVID-19 case counts begin to fall, reopenings begin again and diners can regain confidence in eating meals in restaurants, it will be difficult to see additional recovery in same-store sales for casual dine-in restaurants.",
         "Used equipment hasn't been a big part of the commercial foodservice equipment market historically due to reliability, warranty and food safety concerns. In addition, the industry does not have the infrastructure to refurbish and sell used equipment in significant volumes. Most used equipment dealers are localized in their geographic footprints and wouldn't even be considered to have a regional presence.",
         "We've not seen any discernible impact from used equipment in the market. However, it is possible that it could mute the demand for new equipment for a period of time and we'll continue to be ready to respond if we see it happening. It's also possible that operators will defer new equipment purchases temporarily while they recover financially from the crisis and get clarity on the new demand environment.",
         "In this case, we would expect to see an increase in KitchenCare aftermarket sales as operators spend more on repairing existing equipment rather than replacing it. However, foodservice equipment are income producing assets for operators and the cost of repairs, lost sales while equipment is down and the food safety concerns that hang over the industry will likely keep extended equipment lives in check.",
         "On Slide 5, we have an updated view of both demand drivers and our end market exposures. On the demand side, you can see that the replacement demand, whether coming from equipment or parts, drives approximately 60% of our annual sales. This has been a long-term driver of stability in the commercial foodservice equipment industry as the equipment in kitchens are income-producing assets for the operators and have average useful lives of eight to 10 years. We expect that increased emphasis on take-out and delivery will drive new builds and remodels for the dark ghost kitchens. We also expect that remodeling will occur to implement new equipment for safety and sanitation protocols in kitchens.",
         "New builds are the next biggest driver of demand. New builds for many end markets are expected to be very low for a while, as the industry gradually recovers from the pandemic although QSR spending may start up again seeing as many change to fully recover to or are above prior year sales levels.",
         "The final driver is demand driven by menu changes. This can be in the form of adding new menu items or categories into an existing kitchen that requires different equipment to produce. Operators are also increasingly revamping their menus to improve speed of service and to improve quality of both take-out and delivered foods. These require equipment that can be used across multiple menu items, have faster cook times, and that can extend holding times of prepared food, while maintaining the original quality it had when freshly cooked.",
         "The next chart on the slide is our end-market exposure. Starting with the exposure within the restaurants, our largest exposure is to QSRs and Pizza restaurants. These operators gets the majority of their revenue through drive-through, take-out and delivery, making them the least impacted by the pandemic with most back to or above same-store sales from a year ago.",
         "Our next largest exposures is to fast casual and to the large casual chains. These operators have traditionally relied for dine-in as a larger percentage of their revenue base, but have adopted take-out and delivery for a portion of sales. They've been more impacted than the QSRs but have been focusing on improving their take-out and delivery operations and options. Many have mitigated a portion of their lost sales during the dine-in bans and ongoing reduced capacity orders.",
         "The smallest exposure in the restaurant sector would be the other casual operators. These would include fine dining, independent operators and bar and grills. The majority of these rely on dine-in for nearly 100% of their revenue and have been the most severely impacted operators in the restaurant sector.",
         "Moving to non-restaurant operators. Our four biggest exposures are to education, C-store, healthcare and government and correctional facilities. In education, we have continued to see some demand as schools are focused on making the changes necessary to keep students and staff safe when they reopen. Healthcare has remained strong and should maintain a strength for the foreseeable future. We have seen C-stores and the government and correctional segments spend on expanded sanitation. The weakest sector is travel and leisure, which is still flat on its back, with a 4% of our end market exposure, it is one of our smallest segments.",
         "Moving to Slide 6 of our presentation to review our financial results. Our net sales declined 51.7% in the second quarter with most of the decline being organic due to the impact from COVID-19 pandemic on our global end markets. As we previously reported, April sales declined 60% which was the worst month of the quarter. With May sales declining 56% and June improving to 40% decrease.",
         "Despite previously unimaginable sales decreases, we delivered an adjusted operating EBITDA margin of 9.6%. This operating performance was made possible by the progress we've made on the Transformation Program over the last year and by the cost containment actions we took in March, some of which were also enabled by the Transformation Program. This also helped us deliver positive free cash flow in the quarter and keep our liquidity stable with the first quarter.",
         "On Slide 7, sales in the Americas decreased 52.4% in the quarter from the prior year. As with all of our regions, Americas sales were weakest in April and improved sequentially each month. We did have strong large chain rollouts in our prior-year comparison. Those costs will begin easing in the third quarter. Sales decreases were a little less than the general market in the second quarter due to the healthcare, C-store and education end markets performing better than some other end markets. We did see demand for Manitowoc Ice machines improve in the second half of the quarter, which also supported general market sales.",
         "Looking at EMEA on Slide 8. Sales decreased 56% with organic net sales now 55.1%. Large chain sales were highly impacted as some were totally shut down in certain countries for much of the quarter. In particular, sales to our large carbonated soft drink customers were very low. In the general market, the declines were smaller with Crem outperforming in the quarter. Crem has won some new customer business, which has started shipping already in the third quarter, and should have them close to their original expectation in the second half of 2020.",
         "On Slide 9, sales in APAC decreased 39.7% with organic net sales down 38.1%. Sales gradually improved sequentially through the quarter led by China, Japan and Australia who were the first to be impacted by the pandemic and the first to begin to recover. Other areas of APAC were impacted later. Southeast Asia, the Philippines and India, to name a few. These areas were closed for some or most of the second quarter and impacted APACs overall results.",
         "Moving to Slide 10. We are continuing to make really good progress on our Transformation Program. Our procurement team has issued the majority of the planned RFQs and we have been receiving embedding responses. Responses continue to support our estimates for our targeted procurement savings. We have now begun to implement new sourcing agreements with both current and new suppliers and delivered another small net savings from these activities in the second quarter.",
         "We've also been developing our own site-led value engineering initiatives for the RFQ process that didn't provide the right solutions for our businesses. This is a great example of how we are transforming the culture of our company to one that embrace this continuous improvement. We remain confident that we will complete our procurement activities close to our original timeline but may lag in actual dollar savings until the business returns to pre-COVID levels. We continue to make progress at the five North American manufacturing plants that are currently part of the Transformation Program.",
         "We continue to improve the layouts of our assembly lines, and where we've done that, we've seen productivity and lead times improve significantly. These steps contributed to headcount reductions beginning in Q4 of 2019 with more in Q1 of 2020, some additional reductions coming over the balance of the year. We've taken delivery installed from new fabrication equipment, however, the pace of capital spending for additional fabrication will slow over the next few quarters as we focus on liquidity management. Slowdown in capital investment, combined with temporary plant shutdowns and furloughs will slow the pace of recognizing manufacturing savings by a few quarters.",
         "We remain fully committed to delivering a 500 basis points of margin improvement from the Transformation Program and expect to complete all of our planned activities that will drive the savings by the end of 2021. However, the timing of realizing the full $75 million of cost savings in dollar terms, along with all-in EBITDA margin target of 23% may be delayed due to the uncertainty of when sales and volume levels return to pre-COVID levels.",
         "With that, I'll turn the call over to Marty."

QSR and Pizza, how are they trending year-over-year? Is it fair to say that this portion of the market is -- maybe only down modestly and you kind of have casual and retail -- rather travel and leisure and others that are down significantly. I mean, can you give us some color here. I think that would be very helpful."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I think, if you look at it in terms of what has a better opportunity for rebound or what is rebounding faster, I would say QSR, pizza, C-store, Healthcare and parts are probably the kind of the four verticals there that give you the most opportunity for rebound. Then you kind of have the next tranche of verticals, which would be correctional, government, education are kind of in that mix tier of kind of rebound. The ones that are just kind of flat on their back right now are casual, travel and leisure."

            "Let me see if I can ask this question a little different. On a go-forward basis, OK, if we're, say thinking that we can get again sequential improvement into Q4 or into 2021, my question is should we think about that improvement being generated still by areas of your business that are currently doing better, meaning is there enough upside still to generate recovery in QSR and Pizza, and those similar verticals? Or will we have to count on some of the more depressed end markets coming back in order for things to get less bad or improve?"

         "Remarks": [
            "No, I think, the ones that have opportunity for improvement is enough to generate what we're kind of looking at to get us to the guidance levels in the third quarter. And I think they're going to be the ones leading and there is some argument that the QSRs maybe taking share from some of these restaurants going forward that are going to end up closing. And so there may be more rollout opportunities, more expansion opportunities as they continue to win shares. I think it's yet to be determined how much of that share they actually take from some of that segment. But I think it's -- those are the guys and of course we're really -- we have a very strong position in that segment."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. It does. And lastly, related to this, on the parts business, maybe a little more color would be helpful in terms of where parts have trended through the quarter? And do you expect this business to be able to get back to growth mode at any point over the next say 12 months or so?"

            "Yes. So the second quarter was a really, really tough quarter for KitchenCare. The overhang from the Parts Town-Heritage merger created an enormous inventory build at the Parts Town operation. And so the second quarter was really slow for aftermarket parts. Now their sales actually rebounded but they had to burn off that overhang, and most of that I think will be gone by the end of the third quarter. They burned off a big chunk of it in the second quarter.",
            "And so some of the improvement as I said with Jeff, going into the third quarter from the second quarter is the rebound of that aftermarket piece, and we're continuing to work our strategies in terms of how we can generate more sales there. We're working to become more digital and use our partnership with our suppliers there to help generate more leads and help drive our aftermarket business and kind of get it to the levels where we want to get it too."

Obviously there is seasonality on the cold side of the business. So I'd kind of love to hear your thoughts? And do you think that there is different sets of actions, cost actions that are required at one side of the business versus the other as you look back half going forward? Thank you."

So there is some seasonality there in terms of, the hotter the better for the ice business and it's been a pretty hot last several months and so you saw our inventory was up a little bit and we got some work to do there, but a lot of that has to do with the bill for ice coming into the seasonal high periods here in the summer months. There is a little bit of, some of the colder side product is -- has less of a margin profile than the hot side.",
            "Anything that touches the food tends to have a higher margin. So when it's hot side, it's in direct contact with the food where the cold -- lot of the cold stuff is storaged. So it tends to be a little more price sensitive than the hot side, but both have been doing well and the cold side is -- has been holding up quite nicely. I'm very pleased with the ice business in our Delfield operation up in Michigan."

So I'm just wondering, if you look at China, Australia, and Japan, do you feel like that's instructive for what the recovery curve should look like in the European and North American businesses as you are kind of planning the business going forward?"

            "Yes. I think it's certainly a proxy for us to look at. Europe is a bit of a -- there is culturally differences the way people kind of attack these the virus and the way the government's react. And I think the EMEA area, EMEA has taken probably the most aggressive approach to shutting things down and keeping it shut down more so than any of the Asian or even US regions. So I think you'll see -- I think EMEA is still just going to lag everybody because of the way they're doing things. Now, it's interesting, they also have got some creative programs.",
            "In the UK they just announced Eat Out to Help Out program where the government subsidizes, if the family of four goes out, they will give a GBP10 note for each person up to 50% of the meal, so that if somebody goes out and they have a GBP80 meal the government will pay GBP40 of that, so you get -- it's driving traffic to restaurants, which I think is a real creative way and hopefully that that helps the recovery in that country.",
            "But I think solutions like that will drive recovery faster than just waiting for people, because the big problem is people just need to feel safe and need to get to a restaurant right and getting to that restaurant and if there is a financial reason like that to drive people to the restaurant I think you'll see it recover faster. But, I think you probably see the US look more like China and the Asian regions, and I think Europe will lag a bit."

So that's why I think there is kind of the long pole in the tent. In terms of closures, restaurant closures, you can read the same data that I do. They're talking 15% kind of range of restaurant closures, which I don't know exactly what the number is at this moment, but that's kind of number they're talking about over the next 12 months."

But when you got rehire all your people, kind of got to load up your food and get your -- get ready to operate for a day or two and if you operate for a week and then the government shuts you down, and you operate for a month and shut you down, you lose all that food and spoilage and it's all that -- all their working capital basically.",

What's out there that you guys are maybe hoping for and actually see realistic that could help the industry?"

I think that's really something our government should look at and different regions should look at to try to help these restaurants. It's just getting people there, I think once people get there, they'll feel safe because of the restaurants. The ones that I've been to, you don't even have a menu anymore, you have -- you scan a QSR code and pull the menu up on your phone.",

And I think once people just get over the initial fear and get out of the restaurants, I think if we could figure out ways to drive traffic to the restaurants. I think people will become more comfortable. So those are the kind of actions I think we need to be thinking about and promoting to our governments."

So what you want to try to do is, build up of demand and even if that means you have to shut down for a week, I believe you can run for two straight weeks that's better than running three partial weeks in terms of manufacturing costs.",
            "So we watched that and we put all the tools in place now so that we can look at how many hours we need per week per customer per order per job and we can do a good job of managing our earned hours and what we need to run the factories with. There are some countries where in order to qualify for some of the employee pay programs, you have to stay down for at least a week to two weeks. So you can't do it every day at a time, so that factors into your decision making.",
            "Then of course just the order rate itself. We went down where we had two shifts. We've went down to single shift operations. So we've done all of this -- all the things that you could do from that capacity planning. I think as we look at our factories and as we look at our office space even, I think there is a lot of room. We've learned a lot of lessons about men working from home and video conferencing and things like that, and I think we've learned that you can be very successful doing it.",
            "So I think as we go forward, we're going to have to look at office space and how much do we really need if people are going to be working from home more often than they used to be. But I think there's some opportunities there for some cost out and certainly, as we said, there are some things that we were looking at in the third quarter and we'll talk about it in the third quarter call from maybe a little bit from a capacity standpoint, but nothing radical at this point."
