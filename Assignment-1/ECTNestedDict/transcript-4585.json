         "Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for participating in our conference call to discuss ECN Capital's second quarter 2020 results announced earlier today. Joining us are Steven Hudson, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Lepore, Chief Financial Officer.",
         "A news release summarizing these results was issued this afternoon and the financial statements and MD&A for the 3-month period ended June 30, 2020, have been filed with SEDAR. These documents are available on our website at www.ecncapitalcorp.com. Presentation slides to be referenced during this call are accessible in the webcast as well as in PDF format under the Presentations section of the company's website.",
         "Before we begin, I want to remind our listeners that some of the information we are sharing with you today includes forward-looking statements. These statements are based on assumptions that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. I will refer you to the Cautionary Statement section of the MD&A for a description of such risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, we can obviously give no assurance that the expectations of any forward-looking statements will prove to be correct.",
         "You should note that the company's earnings release, financial statements, MD&A and today's call include references to a number of non-IFRS measures, which we believe help to present the company and its operations in ways that are useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures to IFRS measures can be found in our MD&A. All figures are presented in U.S. dollars unless explicitly noted.",
         "With these introductory remarks complete, I'll now turn the call over to Steven Hudson, Chief Executive Officer."

      "Michael Lepore": [
         "Thank you, Steve.",
         "Turning to Slide 27 in the consolidated operating highlights, I had shown it was a very strong operating quarter right in the middle of the pandemic. So we were very pleased with the results. Total originations were $676.4 million, up over 13% compared to the prior year, reflecting the strong growth at Service Finance right through the pandemic.",
         "Q2, adjusted EBITDA of $31.3 million was down slightly compared to the prior year, and Q2 adjusted operating income before tax of $24 million and $0.07 per share were in line with Q2 2019. As Steve noted earlier, we recorded a provision of $3.2 million after tax as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic related to Service Finances solar business. We also recorded a provision of $1.1 million after tax related to the right-sizing of our corporate staffing levels and office space in response to the pandemic.",
         "Turning to Page 28 and the balance sheet, key highlights to note. Total assets increased by about $170 million. As Steve noted, this was largely due to the increase in the held for trading assets of Service Finance. I'm pleased to note that post the quarter with the subsequent sales, that number was down to - that increase was down to $30 million quarter-over-quarter.",
         "Debt was up by over $170 million from prior quarter again largely due to the increase in assets. And again, subsequent to the sales pro forma debt is now down to approximately $540 million post Q2.",
         "Turning to Slide 29 in the income statement, as noted adjusted EBITDA of $31.3 million was down slightly compared to Q2, 2019. And that was largely due to the decreased margins at Service Finance, as a result of the service fee concessions that were noted earlier. Adjusted net income of $24 million and $0.07 per share was in line with the prior year. As the lower adjusted EBITDA was offset by the impact of lower interest expense and the elimination of the non-controlling interest at KG.",
         "Turning to Slide 30, operating expenses were higher at Service Finance, largely driven by the growth in originations and manage assets. And that increase was partially offset by lower costs the KG as a result of the cost reduction efforts there. Corporate expenses remain in line with our Q1 forecasted guidance of $4 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. And we expect it to remain at those levels in Q3 and Q4. And as noted, we did record a provision largely due to the staffing and office space reductions implemented in the quarter.",
         "Turning to Page 31 on the discontinued operations, key items note real assets remain consistent to Q1 balances. On the aviation side, we made modest progress in the quarter, with two asset sales for a total of $4 million. But despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to expect a material reduction in legacy aviation asset balances before the end of the year. We also expect a significant reduction in the remaining CMV asset balances before the end of the year.",
         "Finally the increase loss from discontinued operations compared to Q2 last year is largely due to the impact of the continuing wind down of legacy assets of the sale of revenue generating aviation assets.",
         "And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve for some closing remarks."

      "Operator": [
         "Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the ECN Capital Second Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]",
         "I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Wimsatt. Please go ahead, Mr. Wimsatt."
      ],
      "Steven Hudson": [
         "Thank you, John, and welcome to our second quarter call.",
         "Second quarter saw a significant business rebound. We are pleased to report both earnings per share of $0.07, as well as solid operating results in the COVID-19 affected a quarter. As we'll discuss shortly, you'll see approval originations have rebounded strongly at both Service Finance and Triad. More importantly, our credit assets continued their exceptional performance on behalf of our bank partners.",
         "Service Finance seized on an extraordinary take share opportunity in the second quarter. We've had unprecedented growth in dealers, which we'll discuss in a few minutes. Service Finance locked in substantial funding for '21 including adding a global investment manager, specifically Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, as well as expanding and extending current funding partners early and adding two credit unions.",
         "This additional funding supported the unprecedented take share opportunity and exchange Service Finance credit short term fee concessions in 2020 with full - funded and increased funding for '21, with no concessions given. Service Finance now anticipates 2021 originations in excess of 2.5 billion.",
         "In the second quarter Triad built and launched its incremental mortgage product known as land home. Freddie Mac's seller service approval enables Triad to offer competitive land home IE mortgage product. We leverage the existing infrastructure within Triad, and we'll be adding a minimum of 150 to 200 million in volume in '21. This program will allow Triad to track $2 billion originations in '21.",
         "Turning to Slide8, KG pipeline substantially improved. After transitioning in 2019, to a long term recurring slash annuity model, and successfully navigating the COVID-19 period, KG is securing significant new mandates that will drive revenue and position it to return in '21.",
         "Similar to the past 2008 financial crisis period, the COVID-19 related economic disruption has driven similar portfolio opportunities, and you'll see later we'll discuss the 3x increase in the KG pipeline.",
         "Finally, we're taking a general provision of 3.2 million after tax related to solar progress payments in the second quarter. Notwithstanding the detailed credit one - Q1 credit scrub which is in this portfolio and another similar scrubbing Q2, solar dealers, particularly in California, have endured long and severe COVID-19 shutdowns.",
         "Starting in June, trying to complete has been a substantially and dealers are struggling to get inventory. COVID-19 has also affected dealers ability to complete customer transactions on a timely basis. Service Finances is actively working with these dealers to complete installations.",
         "Our total solar exposure on progress pay is approximately 13 million down from 19 million a year ago. And actually, as of today, it's approximately 11 million. I should note that the solar loans that have been completed in place in our bank partner portfolios are outperforming the other non solar loans in the portfolios. And I want to stress that this is a general provision for the cost to complete this projects, as we go through and complete them, we\u2019ll determine whether we need the entire provision or not.",
         "Turning to Slide 9, ECN is reinstating its guidance with an adjusted operating earnings of 75 million to 79 million, or $0.31 to $0.33 for 2020. This compares favorably to the baseline that I gave you last quarter of $0.27, representing a 15% to 22% increase.",
         "ECN is also reinstating its 2021 earnings per share forecast of $0.44 to $0.53 in line with the guidance we gave you at the 2020 Investor Day. We've also added in response to [indiscernible] question last quarter the ROE targets for both '19, '20 and '21 in the lower part - on the left lower part of the Slide 9. We will provide additional guidance next quarter, as well as in our Investor Day in the '21 forecast. But we feel confident, highly confident in our forecast.",
         "Turning to Page 11, adjusted operating income in second quarter for service was $14.6 million. This reflects the extraordinary take share market opportunity, driven by the market disruptions, indirectly caused by the COVID-19 crisis. To season this opportunity, we proactively locked in 21 funding to support the incremental take share and return temporary fee concessions were given in servicing income to reduce - which have reduced our servicing income.",
         "Service Finance is fully funded through 2021 at historical margins, i.e. no concessions 21% year-over-year growth in the second quarter originations and 41% growth in managed portfolios.",
         "Turning to Page 21, I would like to center you on the 40% gains in the June and July period tremendous gains on originations and approvals. I would note as continued into August, specifically HVAC originations are up 45% year-over-year. Lennox volumes are up 35% year-over-year, windows and doors are up 46% in the second quarter.",
         "We're seeing a tremendous take share in fact, we're seeing what we call a transition phase where we\u2019re funding mature dealers with substantial pipelines, transferring the Service Finance. It's important to note in these substantial growth numbers, that we made a strategic decision to further limit solar originations.",
         "Solar originations are down 40% here to-date through July and now represent only 6% of the origination second quarter, as opposed to 21% in 2019. As I mentioned earlier, solar loans are performing just fine. It's our view that there's significant margin in the non-solar business and that's the area we're focusing our growth on.",
         "Turning to page 13, a little more color on take share opportunity. Home improvement dealers began reevaluating their financial partners in the wake of the - in this financial crisis caused by the COVID crisis. We've seen very elevated - elevated levels and new dealer ads began in March and May and June dealer ads are two times in excess of two times the long-term average for momentum and it's continuing until August.",
         "As I mentioned a moment ago, in a typical take share a lot of effort a lot of time goes into taking share. This is part of take share but it\u2019s important - all these are mature dealers transitioning with intact pipelines, which are providing immediate benefit to the originations and profitability of Service Finance May and June record percentage of submitting dealers.",
         "And I'd also like to note that this take share is also driven by positive growth within the industry. You've seen Lennox and Home Depot and others report Americans are staying at home and they're electing to spend their money on improving their homes. Service Finance now anticipates 21 originations in excess of $2.5 billion.",
         "Turning to page 14, Service Finance is fully funded for 2021 with increased origination forecast, dealers have specifically asked about funding. We provided our investment grade rating and the increased support of our new and existing partners. In Q2, service finance added new funding partners as I mentioned earlier, as well as expanding existing partners. We added Canada Pension Investment Board for approximately $1 billion of committed flow in 2020 and 2021, added two new credit unions, and we expanded several new existing funding sources and renewed commitments in excess of $1.5 billion. We think we are properly positioned to seize this once in a lifetime take share opportunity.",
         "Turning to Page 15, as I mentioned earlier a more important factor for us is the performance of our credit portfolio on behalf of our bank partners, happy to report the exceptional work by the Service Finance team. In the servicing side you'll see that the firm has peaked at 1.8% in May, that's 1.7 in June, 1.4 in August and July and as of mid August those deferments are 1% like to acknowledge and thank the incredible work of the team at Service Finance. As well delinquencies are in line with historical ranges and loan losses remain consistent with our expectations.",
         "Turning to Page 17, assets held increased to $231.5 million in the second quarter of 2020 up from $99 million in Q1. As we discussed in the Q1 call sales were temporarily held up resulting in short-term accumulation of balance sheet assets. We're happy to report that subsequent to Q2, we sold $214 million and assets held for resale to several parties and the August balances are now at $89 million approximately $90 million.",
         "Turn to Page 17, the chart that we've had historically for you just want to demonstrate the strong month-over-month origination again centering you on the June and July substantial growth in originations which are continuing in to August.",
         "Turning to the Triad on Page 18, second quarter operating income of $7.2 million second quarter saw slight decreases in year-over-year originations EBITDA and operating income related to COVID-19 slowdown in early Q2. Approval originations have rebounded since mid April. Freddie Mac seller-servicer approval has enabled Triad to build and launch its mortgage system and process.",
         "Seven new credit unions were added in the year-to-date including four in the second quarter. Floorplan remained flat at approximately $120 million, with very strong credit quality, almost no delinquencies and zero losses while maintaining our yield.",
         "Turn to page 19, after the COVID-19 pullbacks in March and April, we've seen strong rebounds in the approval levels that at Triad as well as the originations. As there is a lag time between an approval and an origination, the approval commences when the home is purchased at the dealer, and the funding origination occurs when it's installed on your site.",
         "We anticipate originations of $650 million to $700 million, representing a 16% growth year-over-year inclusive of the impact of COVID-19. Originations growth are back to double-digits in July with 11.4%. And as I mentioned approvals and origination momentum is continuing into August.",
         "With respect to the Expanded Land Home product and think of our mortgage if you will our principal product have been shadow loans. Today, I want you to take away four highlights from this product that's been launched. First, it will increase originations, Triad to approximately $1 billion in 2021. We'll give you additional detail on the third quarter call and Investor Day.",
         "Second all that incremental volume is closer to $200 million than $150 million. Third all the work has been done the automated underwriting system from Freddie Mac, the loan advisor is in place. We've implemented Blacknight which the mortgage standard servicing system and the pricing engine system Optimal Blue is in place. All of this is functioning, we have began to approve both - we began to accept and approve applications.",
         "This business will build as those homes are built. And you'll see originations commence early in the first quarter. You may see a few in the fourth quarter but you'll see it fully turned on as those homes are delivered and the mortgages are placed. Finally, the fourth point, these transaction yields is about 3.5% what we call gain on sale in the Freddie system and we received a full servicing fee of 45 basis points. All of that is incremental to Triad\u2019s business as of today.",
         "Turning to Page 21, pleased to report on the credit performance also want to thank the team at Triad for their hard work. We saw from its peak at 1.2% in May, down to 1.1% as of June and now down to 0.4%. Same time we've seen a very modest elevation and delinquencies, no changes to loan losses. So I\u2019m going to Triad on page, Slide 22. The growth year-over-year sorry month-over-month highlights the strength of the system and the return to a very strong growth.",
         "Turning to Slide 23, cash flow operating income of $9.4 million reflects lower transaction services and marketing services as expected due to COVID-19. Partnership revenue was up 24% year-over-year represented by increased annuity revenue and credit card investment management fees. Marketing service revenue was deferred as a result of the campaigns due to COVID-19. I would tell you that some of those campaigns have begun to be turned on again, and we're seeing those build back up.",
         "Transaction service revenue was deferred as a result of COVID. And I mentioned that the pipeline is up on a 3x basis. Our credit card investment portfolio and our balance sheet is performing as expected. In fact, it's performing a little better than we expected. EBITDA margins are at 62%, which reflects the hard work of Scott Shaw and his team at Kessler Group, KG.",
         "Turning to 24, the strategic shift, we made in 2019 with less one-time transaction, and more recurring revenue continues, with the second quarter 86% of the revenue coming off recurring businesses.",
         "Turn to Page 25. And it's important to note that the portfolio pipeline of transactions of potential transactions is up 3x. You saw the same phenomena post the great credit crisis in 2008. A number of banks are reevaluated their credit card their portfolio of CoOp and affinity credit card books. And the number of transactions of pipeline is significant. I don't want to leave you with the impression that $10 billion of the pipeline is all transactions. That will happen because it's not but it's a significant increase in our pipeline. And it's 3x of what it was last quarter it bodes well for a strong fourth quarter in Q1 for four KG.",
         "Michael over to you.",
         "Thanks Michael.",
         "On Slide 33, again, please with our earnings per share of $0.07 or adjustment $0.07 especially in a period that's been impacted by COVID-19. Happy to provide guidance - this afternoon at $0.31 to $0.33 as well to provide guidance with respect to 2021 of $0.44 to $0.53. If I could comment on that range for a second, it's obviously a wide range. We'll provide more color on it in the next quarter and specifically in Investor Day.",
         "But like I did in the last quarter where I gave you $0.27 of baseline, I would suggest to you that I feel very comfortable sitting here today that we're in a $0.46, $0.47 range. And with more to come, we're still working on a number of opportunities. And this significant in my career 62 years of age, this takes share opportunity at both service and Triad is unprecedented. And we will - I'm sure that Mark and Mike will run with us and we'll see great things to come.",
         "ROE will increase to 14.5 to 17.5 in 2021 at the current EPS guidance. Our dealer count is running twice the long-term average. And I want to note that these are mature dealers coming across with significant pipelines of transactions that require immediate funding hence our confidence in 2020 and 2021 guidance. Our Service Finance is fully prepare for the take share and we have locked in the funding to seize this very significant opportunity.",
         "Triad results - Triad and ECN world was kind of a little engine that could we think it's grown up today because it's been phenomenal its execution and we think with the Freddie endorsement and the system's launched, that we now have $1 billion origination business we're quite excited about Triad. As we are with Kessler with the 3x increase in potential transactions, we think that will bode well latter part of this year and for 2021.",
         "We are pleased I wish and I'm sure we can also both personally and corporately. We wish we all hadn't gone through this COVID-19 experience. But the one positive for us is a very resilient recurring business model with exceptional asset quality. On the capital management side quarterly dividend remains unchanged at $0.250.",
         "With that operator, we're going to open the call for questions."

And then were the temporary fee reductions only being provided to funding partners that either became new funding partners who are willing to commit to funding beyond the current agreement and/or increased funding commitments? Or were you offering fee reductions to funding partners that would not have fit into any of those categories?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Right. Well, we don't disclose the details of each individual funding partner, you can appreciate. But we did an exchange for long-term commitments provide select concessions. I think the important point to notice that those are now done and were fully funded at full marginal rates through '21. There was a huge opportunity here, Geoff, to take share. And I wanted to be more than funded coming into this opportunity because I don't think the opportunity - I think the opportunities just beginning for us.",
            "And dealers were looking for us to be fully funded plus more, because they had gone through some experience with competitors that we're not going to name, where they were unable to provide the funding. So in the midst of a COVID crisis, and people worried about asset quality, we provided a little more support to our partners, which is appropriate. It turns out our credit quality was better than anyone expected. But I wanted the increased funding commitments to take the share."

We still expect our overall EBITDA margins to be in the range of 65%. So it's not a hugely material impact for 2020 and as we noted 2021 will back to normal margins."

You guys have talked consistently about Service Finance not taking on credit risk. And I'm just kind of curious when I read the MD&A, it characterize the fee reductions as providing your funding partners protection in an uncertainty or an uncertain credit performance environment. I just was wondering about the wording that you had there."

I could come back to you next quarter and say it wasn't 3.3, it was a million. So I just - that's a variable number and it was given out of a precautionary basis. Geoff, you're free to take it. We disclosed it, put above a line as a cent. So instead of having $0.33, we have $0.32 for the year."

You\u2019ve seen the impact of COVID and it's in - manifests itself in the financial markets and a number of our near competitors and direct competitors have experienced financial difficulty. And if you're a dealer, and you've got - you're installing air conditioners in Phoenix this afternoon, you want funding stability? And it's the history of Mark's performance and his relationship with dealers. So I'm concerned about my funding source. I know Mark system has worked, and I'm going to come over to you.",
            "That's why the funding, a long-term funding. We wouldn't have locked up all 2021 by now, but we did it, made our concessions we locked up 2021 at historical margin. So I think the second thing, Tom, has been people are sitting at home in both U.S. and Canada and they're now building offices in their homes. They're improving their homes. You've seen significant increases of both Lennox and Home Depot and elsewhere.",
            "So we've seen the initial industry dynamics, the wins at our back. So that's helped. But I think if you're a dealer, you're looking for a permanent well funded finance source, Service Finance is your home. I don't want to talk about competitors. You've seen them announced their results here shortly. You can go back and look at them."

So the term between an advance and completion is typically not longer than a week or two is to install the air condition or you can contract that\u2019s two days later. Those are a week or two. It's not a long period. Solar has an extended period. And we're now face to face the situation in California having gone through two lockdowns, which started in March, where a consumer may have a permanent gun or they may have half an array sitting on their house, and they haven't seen any one for four or five months.",
            "So we have the ability and that's unheard of Tom. So it's a learning from this COVID. And we've taken the appropriate action to dramatically reduce our solar. We're happy with what we have. And again, the solar loans within our bank portfolios are performing at or above the bank performance, but we have reduced our progress pay on solar. We just don't - we don't know when we're going to get a chance to get back to those rooftops in California. We have the legal right to step in and complete those contracts, but we'll see how long it takes, right.",

            "Yes, it's a good question, Mario. So we - the current product that Triad offers is a chattel where you take a direct interest in the home and a second interest in the underlying land. A chattel is a great product, that's our core. That's our round peg going in around hole. That we've never had a mortgage product, it has a little longer term lower payments such a traditional mortgage product that was only 3% of Triad\u2019s volumes historically.",
            "The U.S. government through HUD decided that they wanted a platform for affordable housing. And after a year of pursuing and underwriting, we were granted a license by Freddie to be that that affordable housing mortgage provider. So now when you walk into a Triad dealer, husband and wife will be offered a chat alone, x term or x duration and wide payments. You'll also be offered a mortgage product.",
            "In the past that mortgage product we lost it all. It would have gone through to 21st mortgage or Vanderbilt. So it's incremental volume to us. We were not going to carve into our chattel flow. It will be incremental product."

Note that we bought - we have ability to buy back some process. So if we have some excess capital, I\u2019d like to do that, because that does nice things for our earnings per share.",

Are these going to be similar to the complementary flow where they get pooled and then sent out in sort of whole loan basis out to them? Or is it going to be a RIC type of structure for them as well?

The SFY loans are sold to banks, but on a one-off basis, you will. But they are traditional RIC partner like any other partner process, but they're $1 billion of commitment.
