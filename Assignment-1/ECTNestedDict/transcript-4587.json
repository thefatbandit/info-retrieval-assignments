      "Brian Deck": [
         "Thanks, Megan. Good morning, everyone. As you know, I\u2019ve been serving as Interim CEO since the end of June, when we announced that Tom Giacomini will be taking a medical leave of absence.",
         "I\u2019m grateful to my colleagues and our management team and our Board of Directors for their commitment and assistance, as we have worked hard to make this a smooth transition, while continuing to execute on our priorities. Tom and I remain in communication, and he wanted me to convey his appreciation for all the well wishes he has received from many of you as he focuses on his health and recovery. And he expresses his gratitude and confidence in the broader JBT management team during this interim period.",
         "Now turning to JBT\u2019s performance. In the face of what has been a sudden and massive disruption in the global marketplace, JBT has been in a word, resilient. Despite lower revenue across FoodTech and AeroTech, segment margins expanded due to effective cost management.",
         "Our laser focus on managing liquidity is reflected an outstanding free cash flow generation. And while the service side of our business has not been without its challenges, given difficulties in accessing customer sites, our recurring revenue stream remained a strong source of stability and profitability.",
         "While JBT has taken swift and meaningful actions to align our cost structure with this demand environment, we have maintained an unrelenting commitment to the customer \u2013 care of our customers, as well as the health and safety of our employees. Moreover, we have sustained our investment in product development, particularly as it relates to accelerated demand for labor savings with automation. Paul will talk more about that shortly.",
         "Let me switch gears and break down our second quarter performance a bit further. FoodTech outperformed our most recent expectations on volume, margin and cost control. On a sequential basis, FoodTech revenue is down 2% versus an expected decline of about 5%. Gross margins from recurring revenue outperformed due to outsized performance for our juice extractor business, strong parts margins and better than expected mix of refurbishment projects.",
         "On the cost side, FoodTech SG&A was about $3 million better than expected, driven by management of controllable costs and lower than expected healthcare and travel expenses in the period. As a result, FoodTech adjusted EBITDA exceeded expectations by approximately $9 million and margins by more than 250 basis points, with segment operating margins of 16.2% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 21.4%.",
         "Turning to AeroTech. Revenue declined 27% sequentially. However, we\u2019re able to limit the segments\u2019 adjusted EBITDA margin contraction to [230] [ph] basis points, a little better than the color we provided last quarter, again, on the strength of cost controls as well as the benefit from slightly better than expected revenue.",
         "Corporate expenses came in $2 million lower than expected, mainly as a result of an accrual adjustment on long-term incentive compensation due to the pandemic impact on earnings. All told, JBT posted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.01 or adjusted EPS of $1.09.",
         "Sequential orders contracted across the board due to the pandemic impact. With a decline of 17% at FoodTech and 47% at AeroTech. FoodTech\u2019s performance was somewhat weaker than expected, its customers focused on keeping daily operations running.",
         "At the same time, we generated a free cash flow of $81 million in the quarter, as our businesses did an outstanding job of managing accounts receivable, while customer deposits did not deplete meaningful, despite lower orders.",
         "With that, net debt declined from $659 million to $590 million. While our total liquidity stood at $414 million at the end of the second quarter. Our bank leverage ratio was 2.2 times, which keeps us in a healthy position relative to our debt covenants.",
         "I have asked Paul to join us today, given the significant disruptions in the protein market in Q2. Then I\u2019ll speak to Liquid Foods and the AeroTech and provide some color around the next quarter. Paul?",
         "Thanks, Paul. The Liquid Foods side of our business also saw a weaker activity \u2013 order activity in the quarter, albeit better than the Protein side. Generally, the customers served by our Liquid Foods equipment employ a higher level of automation, making them somewhat less vulnerable to COVID disruptions. And as you know, end markets such as juice, canned foods and ready meals have experienced extremely high retail demand.",
         "Customers producing these retail staples are running very hard and engaging JBT regarding capacity upgrades either via refurbishments or new equipment, as well as a strong need for parts and maintenance. However, reduced access to customer facilities and mind share distractions have extended the timelines for converting the pipeline to orders.",
         "On the AeroTech side, our prospects vary widely by end market. As we outlined in last quarter, direct sales to airlines and ground handlers represent about 40% of AeroTech sales. At that time, we said we do not expect many equipment orders from airlines for the remainder of the year. That held true with virtually none in the second quarter. But we continue to engage in dialogue to maintain our strong relationships and provide whatever support and service they need.",
         "The market dynamics for the remainder of AeroTech are more favorable. The 15% of AeroTech\u2019s business represented by defense and cargo markets have held up well, that represent long-term growth opportunities for JBT. The R&D investments JBT has made in electrification and military products are generating strong customer interests that are starting to convert to orders. In fact, military orders are forecasted to expand to double-digit rates in 2020 for shipments in 2021.",
         "As for the roughly 45% of sales to airport authorities and related contractors for infrastructure, the business remains strong based on our backlog in a robust pipeline of infrastructure projects with associated funding, we expect the fixed equipment side of our business to remain solid through 2021.",
         "Across all JBT businesses, our supply chain has performed well. We did not experience any notable shortages in the quarter, due to our historical reliance on a regional and local procurement strategy. Over time, we expect to utilize more low-cost country and consolidated sourcing to improve margins, but not at the risk of flexibility or surety of supply.",
         "Operationally, we have taken meaningful steps to support a safe working environment. While we have had some employees impacted by COVID, our facilities have yet to experience a breakout that has stopped production, enabling JBT to provide continuous service to our employees \u2013 to our customers.",
         "That said, we are aware of the pandemic risks within and outside of our work environment, particularly as it relates to our operations at Florida and Brazil. We continue to communicate frequently with our employees on internal protocols and external risks. As you know, over the past few years, JBT has engaged in restructuring initiatives focused on operational efficiencies, process improvements as well as the utilization of the JBT operating system that enhances our ability to monitor and manage the business.",
         "We\u2019ve also evaluated opportunities as it relates to our manufacturing footprint. In the third quarter of 2020, we plan to significantly downsize the manufacturing operations at our AeroTech facility in Spain. And we\u2019re looking to consolidate manufacturing two modest-sized FoodTech plants into our existing operations, the planning underway. These represent moves we\u2019re already considering, but the current crisis may those decisions even more compelling.",
         "Looking to the third quarter, we anticipate a sequential pickup in orders as demand for replacement equipment and maintenance increases and customers become more engaged. However, from a P&L perspective, the third quarter will be dampened, given the challenging order environment in the second quarter and higher expected expense levels.",
         "We expect FoodTech revenue in the third quarter to be down approximately 10% to 12% sequentially. Operating margins are expected to contract sequentially in connection with the last contribution margin on the lower sales. Additionally, cost reductions are expected to moderate in part in connection with the increased customer engagement expected in the third quarter.",
         "In total, we anticipate higher FoodTech spending of $3 million to $4 million sequentially or maintaining or increasing investments in items such as R&D, strategic sourcing and value engineering. All told, we expect FoodTech adjusted EBITDA margins to return to first quarter 2020 levels at around 18% and operating margins of around 12%, given the fixed impact of depreciation and an amortization expense on margins.",
         "At AeroTech, we expect a sequential increase in revenue of about 6% to 8% based on existing backlog and seasonality as we enter the deicer season. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to improve sequentially 75 basis points to 100 basis points as a result of the contribution margin from increased sales, while maintaining cross controls.",
         "Corporate expense is also expected to increase sequentially, approximately $2.5 million in the third quarter due to the absence of the one-time adjustment related to that long-term incentive compensation accrual in the second quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, we expect to take restructuring and other charges totaling $8 million to $9 million with the manufacturing rationalizations previously mentioned.",
         "These actions are expected to generate run rate benefits of $6 million to $7 million annually as we exit 2021. On the tax line, we expect to incur a $1.5 million or $0.05 per share discrete tax charge during the third quarter in connection with UK \u2013 with new UK tax laws. This is incremental to the \u2013 in the quarter for our base rate estimate of 24% to 25%.",
         "Before we open the call the questions, I\u2019d like to extend my heartfelt thanks to JBT employees across the world. I\u2019m grateful for the outstanding work they\u2019ve done in a very challenging environment and a commitment they\u2019ve made to demonstrate it to our customers and to JBT. I\u2019d also like to recognize our customers that have weathered extraordinary conditions and continue to deliver their critical products and services.",
         "With that, we\u2019ll open the call to questions. Operator?"

         "Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2020 conference call. With me on the call is Brian Deck, Interim Chief Executive Officer and CFO. We\u2019re also joined today by Paul Sternlieb, Executive Vice President and President of FoodTech, Protein.",
         "In today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll use forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language and yesterday\u2019s press release and 8K filing. JBT\u2019s periodic SEC filings also contain information regarding risk factors that may have an impact on our results. These documents are available in the Investor Relations\u2019 section of our website.",
         "Also, our discussion today includes references to non-GAAP measures. Please be sure to reference our press release from yesterday, where we provide reconciliations of these measures to a comparable GAAP measure.",
         "Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Brian."

         "Good morning and welcome to JBT Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]",
         "I will now turn the call over to JBT\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations, Megan Rattigan to begin today\u2019s conference. Please go ahead."
      ],
      "Paul Sternlieb": [
         "Thanks, Brian and good morning. In the second quarter, we experienced challenging market conditions on the Protein side of the business. As has been widely covered in the press, the meat processing industry has been particularly hard hit by COVID-19, causing plant slowdowns and shutdowns. It\u2019s never been harder to access our customers, both in terms of physical visits and mind share, as they were overwhelmingly consumed with new safety protocols and trying to maintain production.",
         "As it relates to JBT\u2019s ability to access customers, travel has obviously been limited for most of the population, and our team was no exception. Having said that, Protein, along with the Liquid Foods and AeroTech businesses have made extensive use of technology to keep in contact with our customers regarding new projects, aftermarket service and training, where we utilized virtual support and augmented reality technologies.",
         "We are encouraged by the fact that in June, US meat plants were operating at 95% of last year\u2019s production levels, according to the Department of Agriculture, although JBT\u2019s ability to access customer plans for installations and service is starting to improve, it will continue to affect JBT in the third quarter.",
         "One of the reasons Protein production has been so hard hit is the relatively low level of automation in the plants as compared to many other types of food production. But that creates a timely and significant opportunity for JBT automation solutions, such as our DSI Automated Waterjet Protein Trimming and Portioning Systems, Prime Poultry Automation Equipment, our XVision FlexScan X-ray Sorting and Inspection Systems, DSI Protein Harvesting Robots, Automated Loading and Unloading Equipment and End-of-Line Packaging Solutions with Tipper Tie and Proseal. Our AGV Robotic Vehicles and our iOPS Systems that increase equipment efficiency and reduce reliance on on-site labor are also key elements of JBT\u2019s automation solutions for customers.",
         "In an industry characterized by tightly packed labor conditions and severe vulnerability to a COVID outbreak, automation has suddenly gone from being a means to reducing labor costs to a business imperative. In just the past few weeks, two states have issued workplace rules, mandating social distancing measures that all facilities with other states considering similar actions. Given the labor density of meat processing facilities, it will be extremely difficult to maintain production levels without greater automation.",
         "Over the past couple of months, JBT\u2019s enterprise level discussions with major protein customers about automation solutions have accelerated. The quality and scope of the conversations are encouraging and lead us to expect this engagement to translate into orders in the coming quarters. Our recently completed Voice of the Customer research with protein customers across the globe reinforces our view that customers plan to invest in automation solutions and confirms that JBT is well positioned to help.",
         "Finally, during the quarter, JBT acquired the assets of Mars Food Processing Solutions, while small, Mars\u2019 proprietary solutions for monitoring and managing the efficiency of poultry processing plants complements our existing equipment and iOPS solutions and advances JBT\u2019s participation in primary poultry processing.",
         "With that, let me turn the call back to Brian."

Is there any noticeable difference in terms of regional demand or product verticals or types of products people are looking at that, I guess one could drive at an odd mix as we go forward or just any notice like differences I would say?"

Geographically speaking, I can tell you that it seems that Europe and Asia are a little bit ahead of North America and Latin America. Frankly, we thought Asia was going to be a little bit further along in the second quarter, but that does seem like starting to materialize here in the third quarter.",
            "And the Latin America is certainly probably the farthest behind given, in particular, our presence in Brazil. And North America, as you know, with the second outbreak is a little bit slower. That said, Paul did mention some of the enterprise level discussions we\u2019re having in North America with our \u2013 with some of our bigger customers. So that\u2019s a promising thing that we\u2019re seeing over the last several weeks."

I would say, the discussions remain focused on the key things our customers are continuing to look for, which are, of course, yield and operational efficiencies, also food safety, which is, you know, increasingly more important every day for our customers.",
            "But I would point you to the comments that we made in the remarks at the beginning of the conference session here about automation, and those conversations are increasing with many of our customers around the globe. They\u2019re very seriously intense and looking and implementing those sort of technologies.",
            "And by the way, I would also point you to our AGV or Automated Guided Vehicle business. We have many enterprise customers who are really looking at making the decision to essentially exit manual fork truck operations and move to fully automated solutions. So those sort of technologies are continuing to gain traction with our customers around the globe."

That said, you know, the board was very clear that this was an interim assignment. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019re sitting at this point. I\u2019m in communication with Tom. So we do talk as necessary, but he is disengaged from the business appropriately so. So as we know more, we\u2019ll pass along at the appropriate time."

         "Remarks": [
            "No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an impediment to M&A. I could tell you that we have a well-developed strategy on M&A. We \u2013 the board is aligned with us. We\u2019ve got the continued engagement with the potential targets. And just to give a little bit more color, you know more broadly on M&A, you know, as we sat here a quarter ago, things were quite different in terms of, first of all, the \u2013 some of the uncertainty regarding debt leverage or EBITDA, cash flow, as well as the banking markets and the capital markets were really not in a particularly great spot.",
            "Over the last quarter, we\u2019ve significantly improved at the JBT side on our cash flows, our leverage sitting at about 2 times, our liquidity at over $400 million. The capital markets have returned, the banking markets were not totally back are in a pretty good shape. So, I would say we\u2019re really well positioned if we see opportunities that maybe be otherwise wouldn\u2019t have in terms of customers, sorry, acquisition targets, succession planning or frankly valuations.",
            "So I think we\u2019re well positioned. I would like to see some improved core EBITDA and some clarity on our orders. But all that said, if you look at our liquidity and our leverage, I could see potentially doing acquisitions over the next year or so, given if we could keep it within our 2 times to 3 times leverage ratio within our current capital structure.",
            "I would tell you that strategy of a 2 times to 3 times leverage ratio has served us well, particularly given the experience in our demonstrated ability over the last quarter to manage our costs, to manage our liquidity and the demonstrated resiliency of our recurring revenue. So I think that 2 times to 3 times leverage ratio is good overall targeting strategy, and it does allow us some flexibility from here."

Can you just size that for us? And secondly, based on your comments and trajectory around AeroTech with some of the business, obviously, you know, ordered evaporated, but a lot of the business actually in pretty good shape.",
            "And you talked about even orders through 2021. Is it \u2013 I know you don\u2019t have guidance, but is it reasonable to assume that there\u2019ll be some organic growth from where you stand now in 2021 that you\u2019d be preparing for or you know based on the orders you have in expectations or is it more likely to be negative from here into \u201821?"

You know, it\u2019s still I think we said that it\u2019s roughly about 5% of the total company and that remains consistent today. But it\u2019s a business we continue to be very excited about and the business we invest particularly heavily in R&D. So because of all the customer trends and the needs in that space, so we remain very excited about that."

            "And so 2021, we were suggesting based on the pipeline of activity, it\u2019s going to be another solid year, but I would say more flattish as opposed to growing just in light of what the strength of this year\u2019s market.",

Certainly the big guys have more than enough bandwidth and capital available as you get into the more local or regional guys. That\u2019s going to be a little bit more of a challenge and perhaps we\u2019re looking for some \u2013 we have seen some requests for a more extended terms again, amongst the smaller guys, the big guys, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ve got the balance sheet."

You know, nearly two-thirds of respondents to our research indicated that labor availability, and this is Protein-specific, that labor availability is challenging and they\u2019ve got to need to automate more.",
            "And by the way, we did the same research about a year ago. And that response rate has significantly increased over the last year. And more than half of our customers that respond to the survey indicated they see, that their go forward plans for new equipment, new processing equipment are going to be changed to reduce their reliance on labor.",
            "I would also add by the way, that we have seen a higher percentage of customers that are looking for cost savings through more energy and water efficiency than in previous years. And we are particularly well positioned in that space with our Prime Water Re-Use Systems and our other energy efficient equipments.",
            "I guess the last point I\u2019d make is that, overall based on the research we\u2019ve done, it certainly seems clear that customers are becoming more bullish as they look over the next 18 months of investment levels and over two-thirds of them responding to our survey indicated a desire to increase production capacity, as well through new equipment purchases.",

And that\u2019s significantly increased year-over-year. So, overall the research is telling us, you know, relatively promising pieces of news here."

Based on your prepared remarks, the way I\u2019m interpreting kind of what you were saying is that, the Liquids side of the business has remained strong. You\u2019re expecting better orders in Q3 versus Q2. Is it fair to infer that it\u2019s really Liquids that\u2019s driving that sequential bounce? Or are you starting to see the Protein business get better as well? And I\u2019m wondering if that incremental improvement is sort of driven by, you know, maintenance catch up and such versus just pure OE purchases at this point?"

            "As we convert from Q2 to Q3, I would expect more of the increase to come from the Protein division, given the weakness they saw in the second quarter. So I do expect that and it\u2019s going to \u2013 and the Liquid Foods that it is a different environment, Liquid Foods versus Protein, because as I mentioned, the Liquid Foods is already a little bit more automated than Protein. So really, what we\u2019re seeing on the Liquid Foods side is more, some capacity increases, refurbishments and just \u2013 more general care and maintenance of the existing.",

But I\u2019m trying to think through the progression of 3Q and 4Q in the segment and the setup that we\u2019re going to have into 2021 from a backlog standpoint, because obviously, the comparison from an order perspective in the fourth quarter gets considerably tougher.",
            "And, once again, you know, I\u2019m sort of wondering here if, at this point you\u2019ve sort of seen enough momentum in the end markets to kind of generate that normal sequential uptick in orders in the year end and if that\u2019s not the case, then how do you think about the setup into 2021?

            "The question that remains the open answer, which is that, it is difficult to answer your questions specifically, because what we really need to see is the conversion rates of those opportunities into orders, right. And that\u2019s been certainly, that was a challenge in the second quarter. But again, based on that increased engagement, we do see that improvement in the back half, which should really more benefit the 2021 or perhaps the fourth quarter, depending on when those orders come in.",
            "But I would say some of the typical seasonal patterns and orders is a little bit out the window in this environment, right because it\u2019s just the different environment that we\u2019re operating in. So again, it\u2019s more about that customer engagement. We do have the underlying consumer demand, support it, but really what we\u2019re trying to focus on is getting that backlog develop in a wholesome as we enter into 2021 knowing that there\u2019s just a significant amount of noise here in 2020."

Is that a fair way to think about how you\u2019re managing production in your business, you\u2019re kind of trying to stabilize backlog and target close to 1 book-to-bill as we think about the fourth quarter and into early 2021?

Maybe we do need to build our backlog which would suggest that we\u2019re going to \u2013 we would like to see a book-to-bill greater than 1 \u2013 1 to 0. And I would say on the expense side, because I know you have that a little bit as well.",
            "But given that increased engagement in the customers and kind of where we see things, we are spending a little bit more as we go in from Q2 to Q3. And at this point, based on that forecasted level of activity, we don\u2019t see incremental need at this point. That said, obviously, if conditions changed, we\u2019re positioned to do additional actions.",
            "On the footprint side, we mentioned, the 2 FoodTech and 1 AeroTech locations. We continue to evaluate our entire footprint, I think that\u2019s appropriate that we should always be doing and we\u2019ll consider that as we go forward from here. It would not be kind of in a short-term reactionary way just because if we did hit orders for the quarter, it would be more how we\u2019re thinking about the business more on a longer-term basis and what\u2019s the right setup for JBT for the next couple of years."

Basically because of the increased consumer demand on orange juice, really what happened was, it was a \u2013basically all the oranges in the country got squeezed during the course of the quarter, sometimes it rolls a little bit into the third quarter. So it was really packed into the second quarter, which makes that decline from Q2 to Q3 a little bit more pronounced than otherwise would have been because of the strength in the second quarter.",

            "So we think that overall for JBT about $1 million and about $700,000 for FoodTech that comes back, additionally we are going to start spending some more money on travel during the quarter as we engage in our customers. And then also, we actually saw a relatively low level of commission expense accrual in the second quarter given the more level of orders that we accrue as we book orders.",
            "So all told, we had $20 million of savings versus our expectations at $15 million and based on some of the - the givebacks or the intentional spending on travel et cetera and the new customer engagement and return of furloughs, I would expect that to go $14 million in the third quarter."
