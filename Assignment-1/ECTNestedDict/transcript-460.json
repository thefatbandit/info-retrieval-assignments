         "Thank you, Donna. Good morning. And thank you for joining us for Enerpac Tool Group\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On the call today to present the company\u2019s results are Randy Baker, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Dillon, Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Schmaling, Chief Operating Officer. Also with us are Bobbi Belstner, Director of IR and Strategy; Fab Rasetti, General Counsel; and Bryan Johnson, Chief Accounting Officer.",
         "Our earnings release and slide presentation for today\u2019s call are available on our website at enerpactoolgroup.com in the Investors section. We are also recording this call and will archive it on the website.",
         "Please go to slide two. During today\u2019s call, we will reference non-GAAP measures such as adjusted profit margins and adjusted earnings. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP in the schedules to this morning\u2019s release.",
         "We would also like to remind you that we will be making statements in today\u2019s call and presentation that are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements. We are making those statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Please see our SEC filings for the risks and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forecasts, anticipated results or other forward-looking statements.",
         "Consistent with how we have conducted prior calls, we ask that you follow our one question one follow-up practice in order to keep today\u2019s call to an hour and also allow us to address questions from as many participants as possible. Thank you in advance.",
         "Now I will turn the call over to Randy."
      ],
      "Jeff Schmaling": [
         "Thanks, Randy, and good morning. I\u2019d like to provide some additional color on our business from a regional view, comment on some of our key verticals as well as what we saw going on in our distributor channel during the third quarter. I will also give a quick update on some trends we are seeing here at the start of the fourth quarter.",
         "We\u2019re starting on slide seven. As Randy mentioned, all of our regions felt the full impact of COVID for most of the quarter beginning in late March. In the Americas, Europe, Middle East and most of Southeast Asia, April and May saw the biggest negative effect offset slightly by China\u2019s recovery from the COVID impact, which started in late March and continued into April and May.",
         "Looking at the core Enerpac product business first, order rates in the Americas troughed in late April. Across our key verticals we saw some strengths in Power Generation with a few nice wins with some large nuclear product orders, as well as some service contracts as several large sites executed their shutdowns.",
         "We also had some nice wins in rail for maintenance equipment despite the overall reduction in rail transport. Our general industrial and oil and gas verticals were down significantly given the reduction in maintenance activity.",
         "From a distribution standpoint, most of our distributors remained opened as essential businesses, however, like us, most of their staffs work remotely and end user contact was extremely limited. Also like us cash preservation was a major driver and most distributors were reluctant to bring on inventory.",
         "We did see an uptick in the percent of their direct shipments in the quarter, which is an indication that some destocking of the channel probably occurred. We do think, however, that this will provide some nice opportunities for restocking once our distributors are more confident in their business outlook and we\u2019re already seeing some of this here in early June.",
         "While quarantined our marketing and commercial teams use the opportunity to launch new virtual training content and conduct thousands of training hours for both our own team, as well as our distributors sales folks. The team showed a lot of creativity to engage with participants, many of them building training studios in their own garages and doing live training throughout the entire quarantine period.",
         "We\u2019re really excited about the level of engagement with our distributors and we think we\u2019ll have a much better trained sales force both internally and externally, as a result to help us sell more Enerpac product when activity picks up and we re-engage with our customers.",
         "Shifting to Europe, the story was much the same, although, businesses and borders shutdown earlier than the U.S., especially in Southern Europe. Sales dropped in April and we saw modest improvement in May.",
         "Within our verticals, we had some nice wins in Power Gen, especially in wind as a result of several years of hard work by the team. These orders position does really well with some of the largest -- one of the largest wind turbine manufacturers, as well as a large installation contractor to provide lifting and positioning equipment for some of the very large turbans being installed these days.",
         "In Asia-Pacific we saw China come back online as we progress through the quarter at the same time as the rest of Southeast Asia and Australia went into shutdown. Many of our large distributors in the region closed completely due to company -- country restrictions on business activity, orders were closed and flights into countries are very limited as well, making it difficult to ship product into certain areas. It\u2019s only been in the last few weeks that our distributors have begun to reopen and local governments have a lot more activity.",
         "Moving on to slide eight and our service business, the COVID disruption combined with a dramatic drop in oil and gas prices across the quarter created a double Black Swan event. Our Middle East region was hit especially hard and our service sales in total were down in the mid-40%s to 50% range.",
         "Over the -- the year-over-year decline -- about a third of the year-over-year decline was due to a very tough comparable from our extremely strong Q3 in 2019, specifically some large projects that we knew weren\u2019t going to repeat this year.",
         "The combination of border closings and the inability to mobilize service teams and equipment in the Middle East, as well as the Caspian drove the balance of the decline in regular activity in what is normally our heavy spring maintenance period for our customers.",
         "We continue to see borders closed in the region and believe it will be some time before we see activity get back to normal levels. There were a few bright spots, however, in the U.S. Gulf and the North Sea and we are awarded a few nice service projects that we\u2019ll be executing here in the fourth quarter.",
         "As we have turned our service focus more towards downstream and MRO, we are somewhat reassured that most of the work that came out of Q3 seems to have been delayed not canceled. So we are busy working with our customers to understand their rescheduling and help themselves -- help them get ready for 2021.",
         "Shifting over to the Cort -- our Cortland business, our sales declined in the low 20% range. While we had some nice product orders in our ropes business sales into verticals such as shipping were very slow.",
         "Within our medical business, the order pipeline continues to be very healthy. However, we did experience some COVID related delays in material supply with one customer and the push out of some orders due to lower demand for components driven by low hospital bed availability, which affected non-COVID related procedures.",
         "In summary for the regions, I can tell you that we worked very hard for all the orders we got in Q3. As we progress through June, we are very encouraged to see signs of recovery in our product business. We\u2019ve come off the bottom of the depressed order, which we saw in April and May, which were at times in excess of 40% and are seeing sequential improvements week-over-week as we progress into Q4.",
         "On slide nine we\u2019ve provided a weekly order rate chart that shows in a little more detail product orders troughing in April, holding steady in May and now showing a nice ramp upward. To-date in June we have seen our product order rates on average about 20% below that of June in 2019 versus the deeper declines we saw throughout Q3. This comes as we see our customers coming back to work, construction sites reopening, distributors turning the lights back on and the general level of activity starting to pick up.",
         "Baring a resurgence of the virus and any associated shutdowns or other foreseen disruptions, we\u2019re optimistic that we will continue to see improving levels of activity. We do realize, however, that recovery may not be linear, it may take some time before we return to our pre-COVID business activity and we have local visibility of the timing of that.",
         "On slide 10, we have included a chart with a range of projections of industrial output by economists at some of the largest financial institutions. As you can see, the dispersion of opinions on whether we will see growth or contraction in the coming quarters is very wide, which confirms the lack of clarity around the future direction of our end markets at this time.",
         "Thanks. And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick for a financial review."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Enerpac Tool Group\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]",
         "As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, June 25, 2020. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Barb Bolens, EVP, Chief Strategy Officer. Please go ahead, Ms. Bolens."
      ],
      "Randy Baker": [
         "Thanks, Barb, and good morning, everybody. We\u2019re going to start today over on slide three. Before we review the quarter, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes discussing the very difficult environment we\u2019re in today.",
         "Enerpac Tool Group is focusing on items we can control in the short-term to ensure the safety of our employees and position the company as strongly as possible for when the markets recover. Our plants around the world have been considered essential businesses and have remained in production with use of extra safety measures.",
         "Over 60% of our workforce remained at home, working effectively with new video conferencing technology. Surprisingly, it has been very effective, in some respects, has increased the efficiency of meetings and the frequency our teams are discussing critical strategic issues.",
         "Additionally, we have suspended all non-essential travel, the only exception being specific customer requests. Our cost control measures have been focused on providing short-term relief to the extreme decline in sales volume.",
         "Permanent cost measures announced in \u201819 and \u201820 have been accelerated to eliminate nearly $33 million of structural and redundant costs. And lastly, we have accelerated the Enerpac manufacturing footprint rationalization.",
         "Our global team have also focused on supporting our communities through protective equipment, engineered and manufactured by Enerpac. Without exception our company has maintained our commitment to safety and supporting our communities in which we live.",
         "As we begin to emerge from the stay home orders around the world, we are preparing our sites and our employees to safely work within the new environment. And as always, we will follow local governmental guidelines to assure -- ensure minimal potential for exposure.",
         "And moving over to slide four, as we entered the third quarter, the impact of COVID-19 was isolated to Asia and had a meaningful impact to our earnings in the second quarter. As we progress through March, the world became fully affected and our order rate experienced a dramatic plus 40% decline. The decline in April was consistent with other conditions reported by industrial peers in calendar Q2.",
         "In early April, we pass through the low point and gradually began to improve through the month. The trough order rate occurred when both Europe and North America were feeling the full effects of the stay home orders resulting in minimal retail activity.",
         "At the same time, our distributors became very cash conscious and only ordered minimal inventory to fulfill immediate retail demand. During the quarter, we believe a significant destocking occurred in the channel, which has not been replaced to-date.",
         "As we progress through the first few weeks of the fourth quarter, the order demand has continued to grow, but it\u2019s still at a normal -- it is still well below a normal run rate for this time of year. Additionally, as oil and gas prices recover due to production cuts and improved demand, we believe our service sales will return to a normal level.",
         "From a projection standpoint, we believe the recovery will be gradual through the coming quarters, provided a resurgence in the virus does not occur and a return to a stay-home order happens.",
         "And moving over to slide five, our third quarter was one of the most volatile we\u2019ve seen on records. Our core sales declined by 38% comprised of 35% down in products and 47% decline in service. As earlier mentioned, we focused on items we could control through short-term cost actions, constraining inventory and providing the best customer contact possible.",
         "As a result, our cash flow on the quarter was a positive $11 million and we maintained our leverage at 1.8 times despite the dramatic decline in sales. Additionally, our proactive efforts to amend our credit facility covenants and repay our senior notes has strengthens our liquidity position.",
         "Our efforts to constrain cost helps to maintain our decremental margin level of 35%, which was at the low end of our expected range. And we accomplish all this without sacrificing our ability to continue to execute our strategy.",
         "On the regional side, North America and Europe experienced a sales decline of approximately mid-30%. China began to recover early in the quarter, while the rest of Asia slowed resulting in a decline in the low 30% range. But the most difficult region was our mid-East -- Middle East operations, which was affected by oil and gas pricing, and COVID-19, resulting in a high 50% decline.",
         "And moving on to slide six, despite the severe impact on our business, in the quarter, we were able to continue to execute our long-term strategy. Our investments in organic growth have become even more important in the current market environment. New product developments contributed six new product families and over 10% of our sales in the quarter.",
         "Our commercial teams have become very creative in their efforts to connect with our distributors, through training and application engineering. We have trained more people in the last 90 days via web conferencing than is normally accomplished in many combined quarters. I\u2019m very proud of the team\u2019s commitment to the Enerpac Tool Group and maintaining a high level of support despite these trying times.",
         "From an M&A perspective we believe our growth strategy to develop or acquire technology remains valid. However, we are waiting for an inflection point which clearly indicates a return to a normal business environment. There are many tool categories, which will add significant value to our company through an acquisition or product development, which remains a top priority in our capital allocation strategy.",
         "Our permanent cost actions -- our permanent cost reductions implemented or announced in 2019 and \u201820 have totaled approximately $33 million and our temporary actions in Q3 contributed $12 million and an expected additional $8 million to $9 million in Q4. We have taken swift action to improve our structure and right-size the business while positioning the company for growth when the markets return to normal.",
         "I will turn the call over to Jeff now to provide some additional insights and our performance during the quarter and then I will come back after Rick Dillon to give some closing remarks. Thanks, Jeff. Over to you.",
         "Thanks, Rick. Turning over to the final slide on page 17, we\u2019ll continue to suspend our guidance until we see improved and stabilized market conditions. Current order trends are pointing towards recovery. However, the potential for resurgence is a real possibility and it can\u2019t be ignored.",
         "As we progress through the quarter, we\u2019ll be looking for stabilization in inbound wholesale orders and indication of strengthening retail demand. And as earlier mentioned we will remain committed to our strategy and continued success with Enerpac Tool Group. We are firm in our commitment to the organic growth, improving our margins to achieve our stated goals.",
         "From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in ourselves and as a normal business environment recovers, we will return value to shareholders through opportunistic share buybacks and reactivate a proactive acquisition plans which supports our tool expansion strategy.",
         "And Operator, with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions."
      ],
      "Rick Dillon": [
         "Thanks, everyone. And let\u2019s turn to slide 11 for third quarter results. Excluding the impact of strategic exits and during the economic shutdown, sales were down 38% and that\u2019s against the record level sales reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 24% sequentially.",
         "IT&S core product sales were down 36%, service was down 47% and Cortland was down 21%. As Randy noted, NPD was greater than 10% of our product sales for the third consecutive quarter, which helped drive sales activity in the middle of the global shutdown. We had a positive $2 million impact from the acquisition of HTL.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7%, decremental margins in line with our expectations. The effective tax rate for the quarter was a negative 7%, resulting in an adjusted EPS of a negative $0.06.",
         "Turning to slide 12, the sales waterfall is just an illustration of what happened in the quarter. Randy and Jeff have already reviewed what we saw in each of our regions, so I won\u2019t spend any time here. I would just qualify that the service decline consists of two elements, the 17% decline associated with known mega projects that would not repeat in 2020, that were in our 2019 results and a 36%, sorry, 30% decline as a result of the pandemic and oil price shock.",
         "So let\u2019s move on to the adjusted EBITDA waterfall on slide 13. Adjusted EBITDA margin was at 6.5% versus 18.8% in the prior year. As we\u2019ve noted, the decremental margin for the quarter was 35% at the low end of our expected range of 35% to 45%. The decline in product sales volume and the impact on our manufacturing facilities weighed heavily on our EBITDA margins.",
         "We announced temporary COVID-19 cost actions that generated $12 million in savings during the quarter. Those actions included employee furloughs, bonus suspension, T&E restrictions and application for certain government stimulus funds.",
         "We received approximately $2 million in government funds from our international locations. These funds are largely tied to wage reimbursements for otherwise furloughed employees. We have received no stimulus dollars in the U.S. to-date.",
         "As we head into our fourth quarter, assuming no meaningful additional government stimulus funds from our international locations, we anticipated additional savings from our temporary COVID actions of $8 million to $9 million.",
         "Our previously announced permanent restructuring actions resulted in $4 million in year-over-year savings in the current quarter and we anticipate $5 million in savings in the fourth quarter. That gives us a total of approximately $13 million to $14 million in temporary and permanent savings expected in the fourth quarter. We are evaluating the nature and timing of any additional temporary actions based on market conditions.",
         "If we turn to slide 14, we can quickly revisit our structural cost progression. We will complete all of the actions associated with the $10 million savings we announced on our last call in the fourth quarter. We are reviewing additional structural cost opportunities and accelerating our Enerpac footprint optimization. We\u2019ll have more information on these actions during our fourth quarter call.",
         "As Randy noted at the end of fiscal 2020, we will have reduced our structural costs by $33 million. Again, this is about positioning ourselves to accelerate into growth and margin expansion when the market returns.",
         "If you turn to slide 15 on liquidity, we generated approximately $11 million in cash during the quarter versus $44 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The lower cash generation is obviously reflective of a $27 million reduction in EBITDA and the impact of working capital between years.",
         "Accounts receivable collection activity remains strong in the quarter. We will continue to monitor our customer collection activity by region for aging deterioration or credit flash liquidity concerns. Inventory levels increased by $1 million during the quarter.",
         "As sales volume accelerated to the trough, we saw inventory levels increasing during the quarter peaking in about early May. We were able to take immediate action to slow down production levels and inbound inventories. These actions allowed us to lever out inventory by the end of the quarter and pending demand levels, we could see a reduction in inventory as high as $8 million to $10 million in the fourth quarter. This is a surgical task of meeting current demand, positioning ourselves for recovery, while managing inventory quantities and cash flow now.",
         "If we turn to slide 16, we can walk through what we\u2019re seeing from a global supply chain and logistics perspective and the specific actions we are taking. Let\u2019s start by level setting on our spend profile. On a normalized global direct third-party spend, our spend range ranges from $150 million to $160 million. We have a supplier footprint that is relatively balanced with our regional sales.",
         "What are we seeing in the market as a result of COVID-19? From a supply chain perspective, no real disruptions or significant price or cost pressures. Commodity prices remain down year-over-year. We have not lost any suppliers or had any shortages, strong long-term relationships with our suppliers is helping us during the crisis and all of our suppliers are focused on liquidity, seeking volume and open to pricing discussions to incentivize orders.",
         "From a logistics perspective, we are able to move product both in and outbound. Although, we saw restrictions during the quarter as countries close their borders. We did not have any significant disruptions. We did see reduction in number of shipping vessels and containers, and we have had some delays but nothing significant.",
         "Availability of airfreight can cause rates to be anywhere from 2 times to 6 times normal rates. Our third quarter airfreight was approximately 800,000. However, that reflects a 60% increase year-over-year on lower volume.",
         "A normalized volume we do approximately 3 million to 4 million of airfreight in a year, rates are expected to stabilize as countries reopen and shipping volumes normalize. Other than air freight, we saw no significant cost increases. We\u2019ve taken several actions in this area as we respond to the crisis.",
         "Over the last few months, we completed the transformation of what was in Asia sourcing office into a global procurement function headquartered in Dubai. This allows us to centralize supplier management and spending controls, and has allowed us to take swift actions during these times.",
         "In terms of direct actions, we have suspended all purchase orders and temporary -- temporarily reduced safety stock levels. These measures were necessary to allow inventory slow to catch up with current demand.",
         "As noted, we have long standing close relationships with our suppliers and are working closely with them to ensure we are able to release purchase orders as demand recovers. Given our size and relative volume requirements, we are willingly accepting some single source arrangements to create critical mass and drive quality standards at our preferred strategic supply.",
         "To manage the risk, we have prequalified multiple suppliers for critical commodities by product family and continuously monitor all suppliers to ensure ability to shift production in a crisis situation in a matter of weeks, minimizing the need to identify, test and qualify new suppliers under pressure.",
         "We also are continuing to negotiate cost reductions with our suppliers. These actions are volume dependent and will impact us favorably as we return to growth. So these actions along with getting boots back on the ground, capturing all available sales and driving new product vitality, give us confidence in our ability to manage our working capital levels during these times.",
         "If we go back to slide 15, we ended the quarter with $164 million in cash, which is about where we started the quarter. Our leverage sits at 1.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA consistent with the 1.8 times in Q3 of 2019 and 1.3 times as of the end of the second quarter.",
         "Our interest rate coverage ratio is 3.6 times TTM EBITDA as of the end of the third quarter. We completed the voluntary redemption of our 5.625% Senior Notes on June 15th. This was funded by drawing $295 million on our revolving credit facility for the $286 million principle and $7 million of accrued interest on the indentures. The revolver has a variable interest rate that currently sits at 1.56%.",
         "On an annual basis at current rates this will result in over $10 million in interest savings and a pro forma interest coverage ratio of 8.8 times. The draw on the revolver on June 15th was a debt-for-debt transaction, our borrowing capacity under the revolver, which is tied to our maximum leverage of 3.7 times was not impacted by the debt-for-debt exchange.",
         "We will continue to focus on practically managing our balance sheet and liquidity. We view cash and our liquidity as one of the strongest assets we have during the crisis. We have used available cash to advance our capital allocation priorities this year, with the $33 million acquisition of HTL and $28 million in share repurchases, including the $10 million in shares repurchased early in the current quarter.",
         "As we said in early April, we will conserve cash during this crisis, limiting all discretionary spends, including capital expenses -- expenditures. We have suspended all additional share purchases during this period of uncertainty. We believe we are in a strong financial position and we will remain diligent in the management of our capital going forward.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to you Randy."

Randy when you talk about visibility in the business, do you feel like you -- can you talk about the visibility, I guess, on the service side, now that some of these economies are starting to reopen, you mentioned some of these more delays as opposed to flat out canceled -- cancellations, just trying to get a flavor for how that could end up coming back?"

But when you think about any maintenance activity, maintenance is not something that you can just give up on, unless you\u2019re going to walk away from a particular asset and we\u2019ve got energy customers, whether it\u2019s wind, nuclear, oil and gas facilities, refineries that need to be maintained.",

But early on in the crisis the maintenance activities that were scheduled were not necessarily -- that we just physically weren\u2019t able to do them because the sites were closed down. So, the volume is still continuing to flow through many of those facilities and the maintenance forecast to happen. It\u2019s just a question of rescheduling itself and so, as I mentioned in my comments, we\u2019re just trying to keep up with all of our major customers and understand as they reopen and as they allow travel, what that scheduling looks like?"

            "Great. Thanks. And then on the prior calls you guys have talked about kind of differences between some of the larger and smaller regional distributors, I apologize, if you said it earlier, did that dynamic still play into this particular quarter or the weakness across the Board. And have you seen any of the smaller kind of mom and pop dealers have to shut their doors or anything of that nature?"

      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Nobody has shut their doors. In many respects, those dealers were considered essential business so they could operate if they chose to do so. Clearly, they took a cash conscious approach, which meant as they got retail demand, they certainly would fulfill it and should get a direct ship from Enerpac and that\u2019s, I think, Jeff mentioned in this comments, that we had an increase in our direct shipments. And so it\u2019s a great way for us to have a visibility into the health of those distributors.",
            "So the larger ones seem to fare better in terms of looking over the horizon on managing their inventory and staying committed to being a major player in the industrial tool markets. But clearly, I think, the smaller player that had a less access to a balance sheet cash that they were being very conscious of not increasing inventory levels."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. I guess, just an additional comment on that one, depending upon the distributor whether it was large or small, also the breath that their own product line and what they offer into the industry kind of dictated a lot in how their activity levels went. If they were in the PPE business or if they were servicing some of those things that were going on during the shutdowns, they were faring a little bit better and we\u2019re a little more active, so."

And then, I think, the one to watch, but certainly, it\u2019s a much lower impact to our revenue base is our South American operations. That is definitely coming to a peak and so I think those areas are going to be effective. We do a lot of business in Chile and Peru as well.

Although, you have service down, but when you look at the waterfall with so much product coming down, it\u2019s going to have -- it\u2019s going to weigh heavier on your margin than if you had an equal mix. And then also if you recall from our prior year discussion, those mega projects that were in the prior year number really came at a higher margin and so it\u2019s kind of a combined effect on our gross margins.",

We look at it in terms of direct, indirect and all the cost associated with employees and some -- all of those variable moves. Our facility type costs are somewhat fixed. I would say, we view all of our costs as variable other than the depreciation, amortization and rate. And so that\u2019s probably gives you almost an 80% variable. It\u2019s just how quickly you can move and act on those costs. And we say evaluating future options or opportunities from a temporary cost savings that includes going after some of those costs other than the ones from like a rent that we can\u2019t get at short-term."

It looks a little bit different than what we had last quarter. So I guess my first question is in terms of the structure cost takeouts, has there been something incremental that was done versus kind of what we\u2019ve previously has known? And then I\u2019m wondering as you\u2019re talking about the incremental margins going forward 2021 to 2024, can you give us a sense for how these temporary costs takeouts might be coming back into the business? Is this something that maybe resets with the new fiscal year and sort of wages normalize and such or is this more volume related and kind of how you are thinking about rephrasing those expenses back in?

We\u2019re -- that first box underneath the progress in 2020, that $15 million is the -- $12 million to 15 million of Hydratight restructuring that we announced in \u201819. We said we\u2019d be at the top end of that range.",
            "The structural cost reduction is the $10 million we announced last quarter and the remaining $3 million of ECS standard costs, which were in that first quarter of this year before the deal closed and then the $5 million is the Cortland plant consolidation. Another $5 million possible with the Enerpac plant optimization and that will accelerate and we\u2019re looking for that to be done in early fiscal 2021.",
            "When you think about the temporary actions that we did, those are -- those actions really level set and end in each quarter. And so in Q4, those will be the actions we announced in the middle of Q3. Those will -- those specific actions will come to an end at the end of Q4.",
            "And as we said, if we need to take other temporary actions, we would, but you should assume that we get back to kind of a normal cost run and the temporary actions for now are there unless we see similar volume that we saw in Q3, then we\u2019ll go back and we\u2019ll announce new or incremental temporary actions. What we have factored in the numbers we gave you are the actions we already announced. They\u2019re just split just on timing between the execution of them between Q3 and Q4."

So we have a fairly strong visibility of our processes. But you never have 100% idea whether that\u2019s going straight into inventory or to restock them, or they\u2019re ordering it from an unknown retail opportunity.",

And I think that\u2019s the strongest element. Now once we get into the latter part of the quarters and our distributors start feeling more confident about how the markets have responded and the stability of their markets, then that\u2019s when I think you\u2019ll see a restock start to occur, but you don\u2019t want to be 100% clear on when that\u2019s going to happen until you see some stability out of it -- all of these regions."

Just on the look forward, I know we\u2019ve parsed out June closely here on this call and I understand completely why, because that\u2019s kind of the first sign of a better uptick here is, just since you\u2019re tracking it daily, do the order sizes give you any information in terms of this as restock or not just if you look at order size?"

So we try to look at did that have a meaningful impact? What we\u2019re looking for is high quantities of our highest profitability cylinders pumps, the core of our product line. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for is, those types of orders flowing through our system at a much faster rate.",

Everyone\u2019s going to look for shovel-ready projects. Bridges typically get included in that, that\u2019s a sweet spot for Enerpac.

            "Well, I mean, I think, that term is used probably to excite people that don\u2019t understand what it means to mobilize a construction job site and I think you characterize it properly. When you think back in history when the T-21 bills were released, that had major infrastructure build outs in the highway system in U.S. It will take about two quarters to three quarters to start feeling the impact either in construction machinery and where you really see it first is in the rental fleets, because those contractors that get earthmoving jobs are going to go rent product first. So you\u2019ll see a drawdown of the rental availability from the major rental houses.",
            "I personally would love to see a stimulus bill that would be meaningful infrastructure building in the country because it would help a lot of localized economies, because when you do a major road job or a bridge rebuild, it affects a lot of peripheral businesses, not just the construction firms that are doing the work. So it would definitely help Enerpac and a lot of other companies. So let\u2019s keep our fingers crossed that we do something there."

But you did say at some point, when there are signs of an inflection point, you could be back in an acquisition mode. How do you characterize the inflection point? Is it just more books coming through and is it -- are there any other indicators that you look for in -- maybe it\u2019s financing.

Nobody wants to go there again. But clearly, if you had a state or a country that had a massive infection rate, their hospitals are becoming overrun and unable to keep up with the demand. Those local governments are going to have to do something to protect their people, and at that point, they\u2019ll have no choice, but to go back into a stay at home order.",

Just two clarifying questions to wrap up, the manufacturing variance at negative $8.8 million, I mean, should I read that slide in a way to suggest that if you were actually flat lining production at current levels, you could have eliminated most of the $8.8 million in manufacturing variances that was really tied to the deceleration in demand or any more clarity there would be helpful as to how to understand that part of the waterfall?"

I wouldn\u2019t correlate that volume with the call it $9 million of manufacturing variances and make that leap. So that said\u2026"

So we have got a lot of flexibility, like the position we\u2019re in and we will monitor rates and the capital markets to make the appropriate decisions at the appropriate time."
