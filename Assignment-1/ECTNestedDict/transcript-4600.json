         "Thanks, Yaki. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I hope you and your families are all safe and healthy. Last quarter, given the uncertainty from COVID, I spent time on the earnings call, providing some insight into how we think about the business focusing on our recurring revenues.",
         "ARR grew 52% compared to the second quarter of 2019, driven by our execution across the three pillars that drive our business. First, landing new customers; second, our expansion over time with existing customers, where we are still extremely underpenetrated; and finally, the renewals of both subscription and maintenance of our perpetual licenses.",
         "On the new customer front, we continue to see greater license adoption on average, compared to the perpetual model. This is partially due to the ease of consumption under a subscription model, but also due to the fact that we are executing on our strategy of acquiring high-quality new logos. We now see the average number of licenses for a new subscription customer is close to five, roughly double what we saw under the perpetual model.",
         "On the expand side, our strategy of acquiring high-quality new logos is also generating greater lifetime value, and there continues to be a strong level of engagement from existing customers.",
         "As of June 30, 58% of our customers with 500 employees or more purchased four or more licenses, up from 48% a year ago; and 24% purchased six or more licenses, up from 16% a year ago. The rapid growth of these metrics speaks volumes to the value our customers see from a larger adoption of our platform.",
         "Turning to product families. 77% of all customers now purchase two or more, up from 74% a year ago; and 47% purchase three or more, up from 42% a year ago.",
         "And finally, the recurring portion of our revenues allows us to move through this time of uncertainty from a much stronger position. 98% of our total Q2 revenues were recurring in nature. As I mentioned, ARR at the end of Q2 grew 52% year-over-year and renewal rates of maintenance on perpetual licenses continues to be above 90%.",
         "Our dollar-based net retention rate, or NRR, was greater than 120% at the end of Q2. As of this quarter, NRR now accounts for the growth in ARR from all customers, and we plan to provide NRR on an annual basis.",
         "Turning to our second quarter results. Total revenues were $66.6 million, up 12% despite the headwind from the much higher subscription mix this quarter. Second quarter license revenues were $34.3 million, which included $34.1 million of subscription revenues, or a 99% subscription mix. Maintenance and services revenues were $32.2 million. To remind you, this line item was impacted by our strategic decision to have our channel partners take on more professional services work.",
         "Looking at the business geographically, North America revenues grew 15% to $45.8 million, or 69% of total revenue. In EMEA, revenues grew 7% to $18.7 million, representing 28% of total revenues. Rest of world revenues were $2 million, or 3% of total revenues.",
         "Turning back to the income statement, I\u2019d like to point out that I\u2019ll be discussing non-GAAP results going forward, which continues to exclude stock-based compensation and associated payroll tax, as well as FX gains and losses.",
         "This quarter and going forward, non-GAAP results also exclude the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible notes issuance in May. Gross profit for the second quarter was $57.6 million, representing a gross margin of 86.5%, compared to 87.3% in the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Operating expenses in the second quarter totaled $61.6 million. As a result, our operating loss was $4 million, or an operating margin of negative 6% for the second quarter, compared to an operating loss of $8.9 million, or an operating margin of negative 15% in the same period last year.",
         "Our Q2 operating margin was well ahead of our guidance, as we: A, meaningfully outperformed on the top line; B, benefited from COVID-related cost savings, primarily due to travel and marketing activities; and C, continued prudent management of expenses across the business.",
         "During the quarter, we had financial expense of approximately $296,000, primarily due to interest expense on our convertible notes, partially offset by interest income. Our net loss was $4.7 million for the second quarter of 2020, or a loss of $0.15 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $9 million, or loss of $0.30 per basic and diluted share for the second quarter of 2019. This is based on 31.5 million basic and diluted shares outstanding for Q2 2020 and 30.3 million basic and diluted shares outstanding for Q2 2019.",
         "We ended the quarter with $326.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term deposits, which includes $215.8 million of net proceeds from the successful convertible debt offering we placed in early May, strengthening an already healthy balance sheet.",
         "For the first six months of 2020, we used $10.8 million of cash from operations, compared to generating $3 million of cash from operations in the same period last year, reflecting the revenue shortfall in the first quarter due to the impact of COVID and the headwind from the subscription transition. We ended the quarter with 1,574 employees, a 9% increase from the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Moving to our guidance for the third quarter of 2020. We expect total revenues of $68 million to $71 million. We expect our non-GAAP operating loss to range between negative $3 million to negative $2 million and non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share in the range of $0.14 to $0.11. This assumes a tax provision of $500,000 to $700,000 interest expense associated with the convertible notes of approximately $800,000 and 31.6 million basic and diluted shares outstanding.",
         "To provide more color on guidance. First, the low-end of guidance considers the possibility of a broader macroeconomics volatility for the foreseeable future, given the potential direct and indirect effects of COVID. With that said, given Q2 results and what we see in the market, we plan to gradually resume investments in the business for 2020.",
         "Second, I want to remind everyone that we will be more apples-to-apples in the second-half of the year, starting in Q3, where the subscription mix was 74% in 2019. As a result, ARR percentage growth will naturally be impacted.",
         "In summary, our philosophy of running the business has not changed. We want to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us in order to accelerate growth, while showing non-GAAP operating margin improvements, as well as cash flow generation. We are pleased with our second quarter results. And as we look to the back-half of the year, the team is focused on executing on a strong close to 2020.",
         "Thanks for joining us today. And we hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy.",
         "With that, we would be happy to take questions. Operator?"

         "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today to review Varonis\u2019 second quarter 2020 financial results. With me on the call today are Yaki Faitelson, Chief Executive Officer; and Guy Melamed, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. After preliminary remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session.",
         "During this call, we may make statements related to our business that will be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws, including projections of future operating results for our third quarter ending September 30, 2020. Due to a number of factors, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. These factors are set forth in the earnings press release that we issued today under the section captioned Forward-Looking Statements, and these and other important risk factors are described more fully in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
         "We encourage all investors to read our SEC filings. These statements reflect our views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. Varonis expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made herein.",
         "Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. A reconciliation for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is also available in our second quarter 2020 earnings press release, which can be found at www.varonis.com in the Investor Relations section.",
         "Also, please note that an updated investor presentation as well as the webcast of today\u2019s call are available on our website in the Investor Relations section.",
         "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Yaki Faitelson. Yaki?"

         "Greetings. Welcome to Varonis Systems Incorporated Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.",
         "I will now turn the conference over to your host, James Arestia. Sir, you may begin."
      ],
      "Yaki Faitelson": [
         "Thanks, Jamie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2020 results. I will cover three topics today before I turn the call over to Guy.",
         "First, an update of our business for Q2; second, what we\u2019re seeing in the current environment; and finally, how we believe the trends we are seeing will benefit Varonis over the long-term. While COVID-19 continue to impact many and our thoughts are with those who have been affected and part of our team, which delivered strong financial results in the second quarter across all regions.",
         "The team is executing well in this virtual environment and our customers and prospects are extremely engaged. Virtual risk assessment and online activities are working well and we continue to see strong inbound interest. As always, we remain diligent in monitoring the business, and we believe that the return to more normal purchasing patterns we saw in Q2 will continue in the second-half of 2020.",
         "As we enter the second part of the year, it is clear that from a competitive and financial standpoint, Varonis has never been in a better position. We believe our unique platform is a massive in this new world. And the transition to a subscription company in one-year is allowing us to navigate the current environment from a much stronger position, with a 99% subscription mix in the second quarter, almost all our revenue today that are caring, providing us better visibility and over time, serving as a tailwind to profitability.",
         "I would like to turn now to the current environment and how we plan to capitalize on the long-term on the trends we are seeing globally. As we discussed in April, companies have now pivoted from emergency spend related to employees\u2019 safety and business continuity, and are laser-focused on the continued elevated risk on a work from home environment.",
         "The powerful data security platform make us uniquely positioned to address this risk inherent to this new normal. The risks stemming from overexposed sensitive data are not new, but reducing them is even more urgent today. As an example, prior to COVID, the Varonis customer had to worry about five offices for the 1,500 users with a handful of remote employees.",
         "Today, the CISO of the company has to worry about 1,500 vulnerable home offices, remote employees frequently used unsecured computer to access critical data, both in Teams and Office 365 and on-prem to VPN. This opens a company sensitive data to enormous risks and system worldwide across all industries are facing the same elevated problems.",
         "At the same time, the threat environment is more dangerous than ever. Companies faced extremely sophisticated advanced persistent threats from external bad actors and hackers, as well as going threats from insiders. Organized hackers routinely bypass perimeters and endpoints, attack weaknesses in active directory, they still been threatened to expose data and hold it for ransom.",
         "At the same time, employees are worried about job security and our customers are seeing more alert, a warning of employees accessing sensitive data outside of their normal habits. This is why our platform is resonating with both new and existing customers, as we believe it provides a much data protection alerting and investigation capabilities.",
         "We are saying that Varonis is very high on the list of priority spending for our customers and the path to double-digit license per customers is clear now than it was just a few quarters ago.",
         "Before I turn the call to Guy, I want to highlight a few important customer wins this quarter that demonstrate the enormous opportunity we have in front of us. We signed a large global manufacturer in Q2 that needed to show up data security and ensure compliance with GDPR.",
         "During our virtual risk assessment, Varonis was able to demonstrate our superior architecture and integration. This new customer purchased more than 10 licenses to support an on-prem and Office 365 cloud environment, addressing data protection, threat detection and response and compliance. This is just one example of a new customer making larger initial investment in the Varonis platform and more quickly deriving value because of our transition to a subscription model.",
         "While we see meaningful increases in adoption rates by new customers, who remain significantly underpenetrated with on existing customer base, which represents a significant go-forward opportunity for the company.",
         "A good example of lifetime value expansion is an agency that allow U.S. county and became a perpetual customers in 2017, buying four licenses to cover several departments. And in 2019, we took advantage of our subscription offering to expand the Varonis platform across all employees.",
         "In January, they confirmed plans to migrate to Office 365 with 0.5 million folders in the cloud that we\u2019re open to everyone. When the migration timeline speed up due to COVID, they renewed all current licenses and purchased seven additional ones ahead of the renewal. This includes DatAdvantage, Data Classification for their cloud data stores, as well as automation engine, allowing them to quickly remediate the open access issues and providing incremental protection.",
         "This is an excellent example of our subscription offering, coupled with a strategy to engage larger customers, who can buy more from us over time is fueling the expansion opportunity within our base. We believe this crisis has cemented the need for our platform and the trends we are seeing should drive greater adoption.",
         "As we look to the back-half of the year, we are very encouraged by our unique ability to solve problems that have only intensified with COVID and capitalized on this long-term opportunity.",
         "With that, let me turn the call over to Guy. Guy?"

            "Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Yaki, I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on your statement that the priority for spending on Varonis solutions has started to increase. I\u2019m particularly interested, I understand the environment and the demand for. But is this existing budget that was already there for Varonis solutions that are now just closing in deals? Are you seeing that companies are actually taking budget from other projects to purchase your solutions?"

         "Remarks": [
            "So we just saw that after a lot of urgency from work from home to add VPN capacity and urgency around laptops and things of this nature, a lot of adoption of Office 365 and Teams, we\u2019re starting to have this just acute risk of people working remotely can access a lot of data in many repositories on-prem and in the cloud.",
            "And customers understand that in order to not to have diminishing returns from this very fast digital transformation with scarcity of talent, they need tremendous visibility in automation. And that really, at this point, we are the only one that provide it.",
            "So \u2013 and in terms of the budgets, it\u2019s not completely earmarked, but we just see that the organizations have a lot of budget for data protection and insider risk and cloud security, and we can get \u2013 we can \u2013 almost always, we can fund the Varonis project from one of these budgets.",
            "So it\u2019s just \u2013 everyday that goes by, it\u2019s becoming a bigger priority. And you see all the workloads in the cloud connected to the on-prem and the data spall, an organization understand if they don\u2019t have something like that in place, they have huge risk."

Obviously, given the pandemic, we would expect that to push some of the business later in the quarter. But just given the strong revenue and subscription results, can you comment anything to linearity as a whole?"

            "Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe first for you, Yaki. Longer-term product question. But I guess, now that the transition of subscription is largely complete, I think, you said a 99% mix in the quarter. How are you sort of thinking about new product introductions in the next six to 12 months as part of this sort of easier consumption model? And what areas could they sort of touch on from a high-level?"

            "Yes. So, for us as a company, what we do most is innovate. And thankfully, we\u2019re in a space that there\u2019s just so much meat on the bone. We believe that there is more ahead of us than behind us. So you have different platforms and also you can go very deep in each one of the use cases that we cater to and integration between the products.",
            "So, we put a lot of efforts on 365. In Azure, which is a massive problem for customers, there\u2019s a lot on content automation and behavior of \u2013 any abnormal behavior with user behavior analytics. So really, in terms of innovation, we feel that we\u2019re firing on all cylinders. And the \u2013 most of the areas we play on, they have a lot of ways that we can innovate and add value to our customers and also integrate all the functionalities.",
            "The other thing that is happening is that, every repository that\u2019s starting to have a lot of data that users are using, we can apply the same game plan of the whole platform with DatAdvantage, Classifying Data, analysts and so forth. So we feel that we can innovate a lot and we have a lot of innovation that we can in the next few years."

            "Got it. Got it. Maybe for my follow-up for you, Guy. Good to see the net revenue retention at 120%. Can you just maybe touch on anecdotally, of course, what you\u2019re sort of seeing from customers on gross retention? And then what licenses are perhaps driving a bigger part of the up-sell, cross-sell performance? Does that make sense?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Absolutely, Saket. So thanks for the question. We\u2019re very happy with the Q2 NRR being larger than 120%. And I think it\u2019s indicative of what we\u2019ve said kind of all along. The fact that customers \u2013 existing customers are not just renewing, but are expanding. And our move to subscription really allows our existing customers to consume more of the platform.",
            "We see many customers buy Office 365 licenses. There are a lot under the DatAdvantage product family, whether it\u2019s automation engine. There\u2019s a lot of \u2013 our 26 licenses offering really allows our existing customers to continue to buy.",
            "So overall, I think it really reflects kind of the commentary on the environment and really the need for the platform. But also at the same time, it shows the tremendous opportunity we have to expand within our existing customer base. So overall, we\u2019re pleased with those results."

Can you just talk about how you see a follow-through coming potentially for that region in the back-half of the year and what you think needs to happen for growth to accelerate? Thanks."

      },
      "21": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So for the work from home, there are several critical aspects. One is massive adoption of 365 and Teams and behind Teams. Teams is a client that enables a lot of collaboration on top of OneDrive, SharePoint and a lot of configuration in Azure AD, which our customers and every organization in the world that use it have no visibility whatsoever. And it\u2019s much harder to manage the data protection and understand everything that\u2019s going on.",
            "The other thing that we see is, Azure and AWS is a lot of those organizations really working with \u2013 on the iOS environment, running a lot of workloads there that connected to the on-prem and through RDP and other mechanics are open to the world and create tremendous problems for our customers.",
            "So this is something in terms of data protection and infrastructure protection that is urging for our customers to order for our customers to manage. And with the 365 repository, we\u2019re just growing very, very fast something that would have taken three, four years, take now six months. And in parallel, the data is growing rapidly on plan.",
            "The other issue is that customers working from home offices that are unsecured, people are online a lot of the time. There are a lot of advanced persistence trade. This is really heaving for cybercrime. So we see a lot of compromised machines. It\u2019s very easy for sophisticated hackers, very easy to bypass the endpoint.",
            "And within the user space, the user permissions, they are trying to access and steel a lot of data. So we really see that from all of these aspects, organization understand that they have this risk that is here, we call it like stationary risk that is constantly increasing and they need to do something in order to fix it.",
            "So for us, what happened is that, it\u2019s just the 365 that we have many licenses there, we took classification licenses, SharePoint, OneDrive, exchange in Azure AD, this is a big platform sale. We can go to customers and do fairly larger deals for the whole 365 and Azure environment with \u2013 this is huge. And they also protect the data on-prem that is going in all the connectivity to the cloud. So we just see an environment that you need to really collaborate people accessing data from all over the place.",
            "And the last thing that see, unfortunately, a lot of the times is insiders employees are scare that they\u2019re going to lose their jobs. And in this kind of environment, sometimes they\u2019ll doing things with data that they shouldn\u2019t do. And organizations are very much afraid of it. They want to make sure that they can maintain the customers and employees and business partners data protected, and they will protect their competitive edge.",
            "If insider is taking a lot of data within when he leaves or God forbid get fired, this is a huge problem for the organization. So this is another thing that we see is just very \u2013 at times very problematic behavior from insiders and sometimes even privilege users, administrators and DevOps people. And this is just an environment if you don\u2019t have something like Varonis, it\u2019s virtually impossible to protect these digital assets and go infrastructure."

         "Remarks": [
            "Just to give some color on the second question on EMEA. EMEA in Q2 actually grew 7%. And if you look at kind of the history of EMEA through the subscription transition, when we announced the transition at the beginning of 2019, the European team was slightly slower to adopt, and we gave a lot of commentary on that last year.",
            "So \u2013 and the North American team was much quicker to adopt the transition. Obviously, we\u2019re starting to see now kind of the flywheel effect on both territories, but we\u2019re very happy with the pipeline in Europe. We\u2019re happy with the team there, and we feel that we have a tremendous opportunity to capture market share."

And I think one of the bigger drivers that we hear from this expanded use of collaboration tools, which you\u2019ve talked about on this call, I\u2019m wondering, can you give us a few examples of how customers that moved to applications like Microsoft Teams are then made aware of Varonis and might partners start to increasingly drive demand for you guys?"

            "Yes. So when you\u2019re starting to use extensively Microsoft Teams, you have channels in OneDrive and a lot of data in SharePoint online. And a lot of just automation and configuration in Azure will be that it\u2019s configuration that it\u2019s not like a human even will do the configuration that are so hard to maintain on-prem, it\u2019s like a computer doing it. And it\u2019s just impossible to understand who can access what people can access from outside the organization.",
            "And once you\u2019re starting to have a lot of data, organizations understand that they have zero visibility. They have no ability to remediate the data to understand what is critical, and they are coming to us. And they are coming to us to with a lot of organic web search and our webinars are working very well. We see a lot of interest there.",
            "And in terms of the partners, I think what happened was is with not a big impact to average sales price and drastic increase in customer lifetime value, we became a subscription business. You think about them. If they are \u2013 they did 100,000, and then they go 20,000 in the next year before. Now if they will do whatever, choose a number, 60,000, 70,000, this is what the customer will buy every year and then they keep buy another 60,000 and another 60,000.",
            "And three years later, this is 200,000 a year. It\u2019s very strategic. Customers are willing to spend a lot of time with it, so they can really implement professional services. And we just see that the partners ecosystem understand it and they understand that this is where the market is going. This is a top priority for organizations.",

And over time, we can get a lot of revenues from customers that most of the time they are delighted with the value that they get. So, it\u2019s \u2013 thankfully, it\u2019s working, working well for everyone."

And obviously, you\u2019re coming off a very strong quarter. I assume July has been strong as well. Has your methodology around guidance changed since last quarter?

            "So kind of if you think about the third quarter, if there\u2019s incremental macroeconomics volatility that could impact us, it\u2019s reflected in the low-end of the guidance. But with that being said, I can tell you, we\u2019re going into Q3 with much more confidence than Q2."

First of all, one thing to note, and I know we talked a lot about that throughout the quarter is that, the risk assessments that we are holding are virtual. We\u2019ve done that before COVID. We\u2019re doing it now. Obviously, all of our risk assessments now are being done virtually, but we haven\u2019t seen any impact. Our pipeline is really strong, very healthy. We feel very good about the second part of the year with the pipeline that we have generated.",
            "In terms of the closing, if you remember, our kind of sales cycle is between three to nine months. And on the larger deals, it\u2019s up to 12 months. So as expected, only a small portion of that pipeline that was related to COVID was closed in Q2. But the pre-COVID pipeline was closed in kind of similar sales cycle. So we haven\u2019t seen much of a change there and that was very encouraging.",
            "In terms of the automation engine, automation engine is consumed by customers very nicely. It\u2019s part of the DatAdvantage product family. So we don\u2019t provide the attach rates. But I can tell you that part of the reason that we moved to the subscription model was, because customers wanted to consume more of our licenses that were geared towards automation, and the automation engine was a big component of that. We\u2019re seeing customers enjoying the value of that product. And we plan to continue to sell that going forward and customers are definitely enjoying it."

And NRR being greater than 120% just is indicative of how our existing customers are consuming more of this licenses and how we can generate higher customer lifetime value over time with this model."

So we have a 74% subscription mix in Q3 2019. And ARR would obviously have an impact, because it\u2019s much more apples-to-apples.",
            "In terms of the new and existing customers, I can tell you that we\u2019re happy with both of their contribution. And if you talk \u2013 if we\u2019re thinking about new customers, I talked about this in some of the other previous questions, we\u2019re seeing increased number of licenses, which is very healthy and our existing customers with kind of the NRR being larger than 120 is also indicative of how they\u2019re consuming.",
            "I think the metric that kind of points out how much more we have to sell to our existing customer base is the number of customers with more than 500 employees, who have four or more licenses and or six or more licenses. And when you look at that growth, it\u2019s grown very nicely over the last year, 58% for four or more licenses versus 48% last year; and 24% on the six or more licenses versus 16% last year, so very nice growth there. But at the same time, and not less important, it shows how much more we have to sell to our existing customer base."

I think it\u2019s reflective of kind of the Q2 purchasing patterns that we saw and how we\u2019ve kind of increased in that line of customers that needed \u2013 need the product and are purchasing us.

So this is something that\u2019s accelerating. This is another like platform sale that you can go and sell for five licenses in one chunk is an an up-sell or new, and this is something that really is a big shortcut to get our customers to more than 10 licenses."

People are accessing from home networks. There is a lot of load on IT, and you need a lot of visibility and automation.
