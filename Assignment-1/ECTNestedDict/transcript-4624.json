         "Thank you, Alison. During the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements which are based on beliefs and assumptions made by us. Our actual results will be affected by known and unknown factors, including uncertainty related to the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic that are beyond our control or ability to predict. Our assumptions are not a guarantee of future performance, and some will prove to be incorrect. For a more detailed description of some potential risk, please refer to our SEC filings, which can be found at fcpt.com.",
         "All the information presented on this call is current as of today, July 30, 2020. In addition, reconciliation to non-GAAP financial measures presented on this call, such as FFO and AFFO can be found in the Company\u2019s supplemental report, also available also on our website.",
         "And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.",
         "Thanks. As Bill mentioned, we want to highlight a couple of points on revenue recognition in the second quarter, AFFO and also outline the impact of COVID-19 related variances in our Q2 results. We generated $34.8 million of cash rental income in the first quarter after excluding $1.9 million of non-cash straight-line rental adjustments, and after backing out $1.4 million of rental revenue receivables we expect to abate.",
         "Two comments on the accounting this quarter. First, on rent deferrals, AFFO includes $1.1 million of deferred rent, which we are recognizing in Q2 and booking a receivable for. On rent deferrals, we have agreed to so far, we expect payment by the end of this year.",
         "Secondly on the rent abatements, after discussion with our auditors, we believe the appropriate GAAP revenue guidance in cases where the Company anticipates abating rent for certain tenants as part of lease amendments, that GAAP requires us to recognize the revenue for the abated rent in the current period despite the expectation of non-payment due to the ongoing lease amendment discussions and agreements.",
         "For the second quarter of 2020, this $1.4 million amount is recorded in rental revenue and accounts receivable. The abated rent will then be treated as a lease incentive in Q3 and amortized against rental revenue over the remaining life of the lease as part of straight-line rent adjustments to arrive at GAAP rental revenue.",
         "We deducted the $1.4 million in rent, we expect to abate from Q2 in arriving at our AFFO. We did not deduct the to-be-abated rent from FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition of FFO. We have provided supplemental disclosure at the bottom of the FFO, AFFO statement in our disclosure so investors are aware of the matter and can make any adjustments you feel warranted.",
         "This supplemental disclosure on the FFO, AFFO statement also shows that we had $1.5 million of uncollected base rent included in revenues as of June 30 in addition to rent that was deferred or expected to be abated. With our announcement of the updated 92% collection result for the second quarter, you can see that much of this receivable has now been collected.",
         "In addition, in performing our quarterly collectability and credit analysis, we recorded a non-material reserve of approximately $100,000 for accounts receivable in the second quarter. On a run rate basis, the current annual cash base rent for leases in place as of June 30, 2020 is $144.1 million. Our weighted average 10-year annual cash rent escalator remains at approximately 1.5% and virtually all of the rent deferrals and abatements we have agreed to cover second quarter rent, so we believe that $144.1 million is a fair representation of the going forward cash base rent for the portfolio.",
         "You will note that we did not disclose our estimate for our tenants EBITDAR rent coverage for this quarter.",
         "This is because much of the financial reporting that we get from tenants still includes time periods prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we wanted to be careful not to present a number that may no longer be representative of current tenant operations. It is our expectation that as tenant operations normalize, we will see rent coverage return to our historical levels over time.",
         "The second quarter AFFO per share of $0.34 represents flat year-over-year results and $0.03 per share decline from the first quarter 2020. Results were impacted negatively by $0.04 per share for the following COVID-related variances, which were offset partially by the accretive benefit of first quarter and second quarter acquisitions.",
         "Approximately 50% of the impact or $0.02 per share was from the $1.4 million rental abatement in connection with the lease modifications as we\u2019ve outlined above. Approximately 25% of the impact or $0.01 per share was due to the Kerrow operating loss given its operations were closed or negatively impacted for much of the quarter.",
         "And approximately 25% of the impact or $0.01 per share was due to other COVID-related expenses, including abandoned deal costs, lease modification costs, the small credit reserve I mentioned and higher interest expense to fund excess cash reserves that we held in April and May.",
         "Turning to the balance sheet. Since our last update, the funding of the final $50 million of nine-year notes of the $125 million private note offering that was announced in March was completed on June 9.Regarding our cash and revolver balance, we ended the second quarter with $4.5 million of revolver balance and about $5 million of cash reserves. And importantly, $245 million of availability on our revolving line of credit.",
         "As a reminder, we paid our full second quarter dividend, which was fully covered by recurring cash flows. Finally, our leverage metrics remain quite strong, with a fixed charge coverage of 4.8 times in the second quarter and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDAR of 5.6 as of June 30. Our revolver maturity can be extended to November 2020 at our option, which is also the timing of the first $150 million of term debt maturity.",
         "We remain committed to maintaining a net debt leverage target below 5.5 times to 6 times. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bill for closing comments."

         "Good day, and welcome to the Four Corners Property Trust Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.",
         "I would now like to turn the conference over to Gerry Morgan, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead."
      ],
      "William Lenehan": [
         "Thank you, Gerry. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our -- us to discuss our second quarter results, and I hope all of you and your families were staying healthy.",
         "We were very pleased with the second quarter results and the strong level of collections we\u2019re reporting for that quarter, and as of today, collections are over 99% for July. I would like to clarify that number for our investors in the plainest terms possible. For all leases in our portfolio, we have already received over 99% of the cash base rent payments for the month of July. Given that we\u2019ve only agreed to abate approximately $20,000 in rent during July and not agreed to any deferrals for the month of July, we believe this is a remarkable achievement for our team and our shareholders given the ongoing pandemic. This is a testament to both the low rents of the properties in our portfolio and to the strength of our tenants and their tenacity in adjusting their operating models to the current COVID environment.",
         "Let me start with a few additional comments on collections. Our team has worked tirelessly with our tenants to stay abreast of their business operations and to work creatively when applicable, on lease modifications. Through this effort, we\u2019ve collected over 92% of second quarter rent payments. In addition, we have agreed to defer approximately 3% of second quarter rent payments until later this year and have agreed or expect to shortly agree to abate an incremental 4% of second quarter rents. This leaves only approximately 1% of our rents for Q2 unresolved.",
         "While most retail landlords have observed their tenants requesting relief over this period, FCPT only agreed to a select number of deferral and abatement agreements in cases where tenants exchanged favorable concessions in lease modifications for those deferments or abatements. These -- importantly, these concessions include lease term extensions, increased financial reporting, guarantor improvement, annual rent bumps, swapping fair market rent adjustments for stable contractual rent, and incremental percentage rent, among other terms.",
         "Despite the ongoing difficulties in coping with the pandemic, through these difficult negotiations, we have longer contracts release duration and higher rent growth than we had going into this, and believe we have strengthened our working relationships with many of our tenants. In essence, the stance we\u2019ve taken over the last few months is that, FCPT is always willing to listen to and work with our tenants, but we need to make sure that we are capturing value for our shareholders as part of any occasion, where we open the lease document.",
         "Free rent relief and deferment is not something FCPT has provided to any tenant and we were careful not to rush to negotiations in the early days of the pandemic when operators were most fearful of the environment. It was very helpful that we\u2019ve acquired and scored in our investment model all of these properties from the past few years. This proved important in determining where we wanted to focus our efforts in lease modification discussions.",
         "Nearly all deferment and abatement was contained within the second quarter, which resulted in our step-up for July collections to over 99% of rental payments. We expect the collection trend to continue going forward and that remaining outstanding rent balances for April through June will reach resolution in the very near-term.",
         "We do note that for a very small number of tenants we established a minimal credit reserve for the second quarter rents. Please note that we\u2019ve included a new slide in our quarterly supplemental entitled COVID-19 Rent Collections Update, which summarizes the rent collection deferral and abatement numbers we\u2019ve disclosed in tabular form. I think you\u2019ll find it very helpful.",
         "The reopening of the country and the impact on restaurant traffic will continue to be a fluid situation and, of course, is hard to predict. As we\u2019ve said in the last quarter, however, we continue to believe that strong operators like Darden, Brinker, Bloomin\u2019 Brands, RBI and others in our portfolio should benefit in the long run from their scale, and in the near term from the investment technology, specifically off-premise and to-go capabilities.",
         "It is worth calling out that in an environment like this is exactly why FCPT has focused on low rent properties with strong sales and rent coverage and on fortified balance sheets. We observed many tenants in the quick service and casual dining sectors returns to sales near 2019 levels by late June.",
         "In the case of quick service operators, some even exceeded 2019 sales levels. This is despite one of the most challenging operating periods in restaurant history. And yet, despite these challenges, we believe our portfolio remains very healthy. The coming months will undoubtedly continue to have market volatility and consumer behavior mix shift once again, but we believe that our conservative underwriting we preach here at FCPT distinguishes us in times of turbulence and we\u2019ll continue to serve the portfolio well through the pandemic.",
         "Our Kerrow subsidiary, which I\u2019ll remind you is the six LongHorn Steakhouses we operate in San Antonio is very ably managed by Carol Dilts. Because of COVID, their quarterly results were a negative $415,000 versus a positive contribution of over $200,000 in the first quarter. Carol and her team did an extraordinary job given the circumstances. In addition, Kerrow provided a real-time understanding of what our tenants were going through and how they\u2019re adapting. Kerrow recovered very quickly from the first phase of COVID and I anticipate them doing well later in this year.",
         "Now, turning to our reported results in the second quarter. We achieved AFFO per share of $0.34, which represents flat year-over-year results. As Gerry will outline in more detail, this is -- this included approximately $0.04 per share of dilution from COVID-related items. Our AFFO this quarter includes the deferred rents outlined above, which believe we\u2019ll receive by the end of the year but excludes second quarter rent we expect to abate in conjunction with lease modifications.",
         "Turning to acquisitions, we resumed activities in the second half of June with even greater focus on acquiring only the most stable and creditworthy properties within our pipeline, and applying that same stringent filter to any new investments. We acquired 11 properties in the second quarter for a combined purchase price of $32.7 million at an initial weighted average cash yield of 6.3%.",
         "In July we have acquired an additional five properties for a combined purchase price of $10.3 million with an initial average cash yield of 6.5%. Speaking to the quality of these recent acquisitions, 17 of the 18 leases are -- at these properties are with the brands corporate operator or guaranteed by the corporate entity and 11 leases are ground leases, where FCPT owns the land and the tenants constructed the building, which typically equates to low rents.",
         "While the pricing of these acquisition stayed in line with our historical yield range, we believe the quality of the real estate and tenant credit are strong, and further improved the quality brand of the overall portfolio. We would expect more of the same in the coming months.",
         "Finally, before I turn it over to Gerry to discuss some of the financial results one operational update and a recap of where we stand today. On operations, we moved into a new larger office space in our current office building in Mill Valley and we look forward to hosting any of you in the area once travel resumes. Our team is currently working remotely but remains highly effective.",
         "In summary, we have posted rent collections for Q2 that are among the strongest in the net lease sector, and we are at a high-level of rent collections for July, which we hope and expect to continue going forward. We are once again acquiring properties and are excited to return to growth and building the portfolio.",
         "Now, Gerry will take you through our financial results. Gerry?",
         "Thanks, Gerry. We remain focused on staying nimble in the current environment. We are pleased with the strong rent collection results and have our year back to the ground on new investment opportunities. We are available to answer any questions on the quarter or the portfolio, so please reach out if you\u2019d like to speak.",
         "Finally, a special note of acknowledgment to our colleague, Laura Gatti, who has worked tirelessly this quarter on collections. Laura was born in Colombia and is the first in her family to immigrate to the United States. We are happy to report that she passed her US citizenship test yesterday. Way to go, Laura.",
         "I\u2019d like to turn it back to the operator for Q&A."

So, it\u2019s still very substantive."

I would say, to the best of my knowledge, virtually all of it\u2019s open and operating to some extent, and most are taking diners into the restaurant, those that are operating on curbside. What I would say is, we\u2019ve seen states go from curbside to 25 to 50 to 75 to 100 and then very often back to 75 or 50 in states like Texas and Florida. But generally speaking, almost all the restaurants are open, and I think we\u2019ll just see it be a fluid situation as time goes on. I would also say that I think a lot of our casual dining restaurants are seeing continued elevated to-go sales, which is something I think we\u2019ll be stickier than many had initially predicted. Almost all of the properties are operating. Sure."

And then, just to clarify, I know you went through a number of lease kind of changes that could be possible, but the abatement part that you mentioned, was it most typically that you gave rent abatement if a tenant agreed to a lease extension? And if not, like what were the other like good amendment changes for Four Corners?"

      },
      "19": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. In all the deferment and abatement discussions, I think almost all of them included lease term extensions of between five and, in some cases, 10 years. We added some properties to master leases. We changed renewal terms to be more favorable. In some cases, we changed rent growth that was 10% every five years to annual growth, which makes a little bit more attractive and having consistent income.",
            "We had discussions with tenants about purchasing properties off their balance sheet. But as you said, Sheila, the big one is lease extensions. And so, we were able to negotiate a very significant number of meaningful lease extensions for what we view is quite moderate rent abatement or deferral."

If that\u2019s something that we would have done absent COVID, that\u2019s sort of how to think about it.

         "Remarks": [

So, it allows us to layer in some diversity of lease term earlier than sort of the 10-year portfolio average. And so, as you mentioned, you get better pricing, better credit, were selecting for properties that have very high-level of performance and given that we have very little lease turn in the next several years, it\u2019s something that we can do pretty favorably. And of course, during something like the current environment that\u2019s the first thing we go to when we open up the lease document is to get more term."

Are the returns attractive enough that funding via common even if that level makes sense to you? Do you ramp up dispositions to trade in and out, issue preferred?

Obviously, shopping center, strip center, grocery anchored, and all sorts of retail landlords are looking for ways to access liquidity, and outparcels are a great way to do it.

Maybe if you were more focused on the breakfast daypart, it was a little worse than that, that\u2019s sort of been slower to recover. So, we felt really quite good with additional cases in the last few weeks, traffic has slowed. But I think we\u2019ll see that come back if cases begin to wane again.

It\u2019s very -- it\u2019s highly dependent on what geography you are in. And then lastly, we operate six restaurants in San Antonio. So we have that case study literally daily of how they\u2019re performing. So, we track it feverishly.
