         "Thank you, Colon. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Franco-Nevada's Second Quarter 2020 Results. Accompanying this call is a presentation which is available on our website at Franco-Nevada.com, where you will also find our full financial results. Sandip Rana, CFO of Franco-Nevada will provide a brief review of our results and Paul Brink, President and CEO of Franco-Nevada, will provide a business development update. This will be followed by Q&A period. Representatives to my executive team are present in our boardroom to answer any questions.",
         "We would like to remind participants that some of today's commentary may contain forward-looking information and we refer you to our detailed cautionary note on Slide 2 of this presentation. I will now turn over the call to Sandip Rana, CFO of Franco-Nevada."

         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Franco-Nevada Corporation Q2 2020 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Candida Hayden. Please go ahead."

      "Paul Brink": [
         "Thank you, I'll be talking about recent business development activity and our future growth drivers. During Q2, we reached agreement on 100 million financing for SolGold, where we will receive a 1% NSR on oil production from a Cascavel property in Ecuador. Cascavel is a large copper-gold porphyry system amenable to block caving, and we believe one of the best copper-gold development projects globally. M&I Resources are 2.7 billion tonnes at 0.53% copper equivalent, very interesting to us that includes more than 21 million ounces of gold. The resource includes a high-grade core of more than 440 million tonnes at 1.4% copper equivalent. So, goal has the option until January of next year to increase the deal by 50% that would be a 1.5% royalty and $150 million financing. They also have the option to buy back half of the royalty for a period of time. We've retained an option to convert the NSR in all metals to a gold only royalty on an NPV neutral basis.",
         "As COVID travel restrictions were in place when we agreed the transaction on site due diligence was deferred. We've provided interim funding to a Lasso goal to continue its activities until we can complete our due diligence. [indiscernible] for the transaction goes to Eaun Gray and our business development team, and they are available to take any questions later in the call.",
         "I'll turn now to our growth outlook, we feel particularly well positioned as the gold price runs with a close to 20 year reserve life and built-in growth for the next number of years. Business development remains active, short-term, we expect to be successful with some smaller transactions; medium term, we're active bidding on larger transactions although as always these are competitive processes. We also expect some attractive energy assets will become available as the sector shakes out. Organic growth is again becoming a big contributor as we move further end of the global market.",
         "Slide 10 shows the expect to drivers -- Expansions on Stillwater, Tasiast and Macassa and the construction of Salares Norte and Coroccohuayco are included in our 5-year guidance. But, we also have a very broad portfolio with 35 other mining development projects and greater than 200 exploration projects. The pace of development at many of these assets has picked up, assets like Ballantyne Lake, Hardrock, [indiscernible] gold in Monument Bay are not in our 2024 guidance and their development is more and more likely.",
         "Slide 11 highlights positive portfolio updates from the quarter. I'll point to one in particular [indiscernible] in Australia that's undergoing a change. Historically mines as a number of open pit deposits they've discovered major underground extensions and are currently developing the first of a number of underground mines. One development, not on the slide, it now appears there's good potential for life extensions at our Sudbury PGM streams. We've also seen great exploration success at a number of our assets, particularly in Canada, [indiscernible] East Gouldie at Malartic and extensions at Macassa and Hemlo. SK Creek is also increasingly looking like it will have a second life has an open pit operation. All this organic growth would come at no cost.",
         "The final topic to cover is our available capital showed on Slide 12, our cash balance is building rapidly we have working capital of [indiscernible] million and we have no debt, including our available credit facilities of 1.1 billion, we have a total of $1.7 billion of available capital to deploy on new opportunities to grow the company. With that, I'll hand it to the operator and we welcome any questions."

      "Sandip Rana": [
         "Thanks Candida. Good morning everyone. As we all know, Second Quarter 2020 was not your typical quarter, Franco-Nevada like many many companies was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company had ended 2019 with very strong performance from its royalty and stream assets, which continued into first quarter 2020. However with COVID-19, we had a number of interest impacted in the second quarter. Our 56 producing assets at the end of March, 15 were impacted in some way. These assets were either mandated to shut down or to partially curtailed production. As of today, we are pleased that almost all of the assets that were impacted have resumed normal operations. Only the Golden Highway assets remained closed.",
         "We look forward to our royalties and streams resuming normal operations and continuing to deliver the growth built into our portfolio. On Slide 3, we have highlighted the gold and gold equivalent ounces for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Overall despite the portfolio not performing as planned due to the pandemic, GEO sold were fairly stable for both periods shown. For second quarter 2020, GEO sold over 104,330 compared to 107,774 a year ago. The company has benefited from GEOs delivered and sold from Cobber Panama as a company began receiving gold [indiscernible] ounces in third quarter last year. However deliveries in Q2 2020 were hindered by the mine being placed on care and maintenance because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect deliveries to ramp up over the next few months as the mine has resumed operations. One other material asset that did deliver last GEOs in second quarter compared to a year ago was Antapaccay. The mine did experience concentrate shipment delays in April and May as a result of the pandemic, but we are beginning to see catch up deliveries of those delayed shipments.",
         "With respect to the rest of the portfolio, one asset which showcased its leverage to the rising gold prices was Hemlo. Franco-Nevada has a 50% net profit interest on the interleague deposit within Hemlo. The company saw substantial increase in GEOs delivered and revenue recognized for the second quarter compared to a year ago. We expect this asset to continue to do well as gold prices increase. With respect to PGM silver and other mining assets, the company did recognize last GEO sold, which was in line with expectations.",
         "Slide 4 highlights are gold and gold equivalent revenue for Q2 2020, Q1 2020 and Q2 2019. The company's gold and gold equivalent revenue increased 26% compared to a year ago despite relatively flat GEO sold. The increase in revenue was due to the increase in gold prices with the average gold price for second quarter being 17-11 per ounce compared to 13-10 per ounce a year ago. Energy revenue had a significant decrease year-over-year decreasing from 27.6 million in Q2 2019 to 14.6 million in Q2 2020. Overall production at the assets did increase for the energy side, but this was negated by the lower oil and gas prices realized in the quarter. As you are aware, oil prices reached historic lows in April 2020.",
         "As you turn to Slide 5, you will see the key financial results for the company. I won't get into the detailed numbers, but the company continues to deliver strong financial metrics being revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income. For Q2 2020 adjusted EBITDA was 158.1 million, 14.6% increase over a year ago. When adjusting for unusual items, adjusted net income was 43.4% higher in Q2 2020 compared to Q2 2019 at 91.8 million versus 64 million a year ago.",
         "On Slide 6, we illustrate the diversification of our portfolio revenue generation. As shown 92% of our quarterly revenue was generated by gold and gold equivalents in second quarter with gold being 70%, silver 10%, PGMs 11% and other mining 1%. From a geographic revenue profile, revenue was sourced 82% from the America with Latin America being the largest.",
         "The third chart highlights the asset diversification of the company. Candelaria was our largest revenue generator at 14% for the quarter, our top four core assets Cobre Panama, Candelaria, Antapaccay and Antamina generated 36% of the revenue for the company.",
         "One area that our Board and management is very proud of is our focus on cost management and being a high margin business. We'd like to stress the strength of our business model and the scalability.",
         "The chart on Slide 7 illustrates that the margin for the company increases as gold prices increase. Our cost structure, which we reflect in our cash cost per ounce includes our cost of sales less cost associated with the energy business. As you can see it does fluctuate quarterly but approximates $250 to $300 per ounce. If gold prices continue to rise, we expect to benefit fully as the cost per ounce should not increase significantly. This is truly a high margin business.",
         "As you are aware, on April 7, 2020, the company did retract its GEO sold guidance due to the uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19. In addition, the energy revenue guidance was [indiscernible] due to the sharp decrease in energy prices and the related volatility. Management is reinstating guidance for 2020, but its royalty and stream assets impacted by the pandemic begin to return to normal operations. Based upon performance for the first 6 months of the year and our expectations for the second half, the GEO sold guidance is 475,000 to 505,000. This guidance is based on commodity prices of $1800 gold, $20 silver, 900 and $2200 palladium.",
         "With respect to the energy division, revenue is projected to be between 60 to 75 million for the year. This is assuming a $40 WTI oil price and $2 Mcf natural gas price.",
         "Before I turn it over to Paul, I wanted to provide an update on the CRA audit with respect to the transfer pricing reassessments received for Mexico and Barbados, there are no material changes to what has been disclosed previously. However, in July, the company did receive a proposal letter related to tax years 2012 and 2013 for foreign accrual property income. CRA claims that the income for those tax years earned in Barbados should be taxed in Canada under FAPI. The tax owed would be approximately $7 million fee for interest and penalties. Franco-Nevada does not agree with the proposal, nor the calculation prepared by CRA and has made this clear to CRA and now, I will pass it over to Paul, who will provide an update on available capital and discuss about it."

So, the First Quantum states that there'll be a fully ramped up by mid-August and then from there, it can take anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks for us to be paid, so we should see some deliveries in August. But, I would say towards the second half of September is when we will get back on track."

I see Weyburn was one of the hardest hit and WTI has recovered since -- I just want to get a sense of in your guidance for energy revenue, how much of that is allocated to Weyburn and how do you think that asset performs in relation to the others in the second half of the year?"

      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Weyburn should improve dramatically in the second half of the year. As you know when the prices collapsed in April and May, the realized price for Weyburn dropped significantly with around $20 a barrel, or so which was less than the cost of capital and operating. And so there was actually a negative -- a small negative balance there on the NRI that will turn around to the back half of the year as prices improved. So there should be significant increase in revenue from particularly the Weyburn and NRI. And second part of the year and that is factored into our guidance for energy."

So, it's -- I guess added to the balance sheet beyond free cash flow. How should we look at the ATM going forward, is this is kind of a constant revenue stream for the company or is this expected to be used for a deal or is there some implication on valuation, we should be looking into for the use of that ATM program."

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. So it's a tool for us and we've been opportunistic initially the goal was to pay off our debt, which we've done. And then part of that is what's in front of us in terms of deal flow. But if the cash does sit on the balance sheet, I think we've shown over time that we can deploy it and it's a very cyclical business whoever has cash usually benefits at the end of the day. Will it be ongoing. I think it's a tool for us to continue to look at using, but as we've always said we will be opportunistic."

And then with regards to the change in guidance for 2020, there is a bunch of moving parts, I guess factoring in COVID related items some changes at the underlying operations and then the change in the commodity price assumptions. Is there any read through on the guidance change with respect to -- if you could provide in terms of the underlying operating asset changes, specifically I guess that result of that I guess Candelaria is one larger change, but is there anything else we should be aware of, maybe for our forecast going forward?"

But otherwise, we assumed the operations will return to normal in the second half of the year."

So I want to core objectives of the company is to have a sustainable and progressive dividend and how that track record where we've increased it every year, unfortunately, we've been able to do so for the last 13 years. Yes, we increased it by $0.01 per quarter recently, and we'll look to increase it is going forward, but there is no metric that we tie it to and depending on where we are in the [indiscernible] it could lead to higher than traditional increases. But again, it will just depend what's in front of us at the time. But we are committed to raising our dividend each year."

Paul, as you mentioned the opportunities out there. Could you maybe in the past, you talked about one opportunity as you talked about as precious metal streams of base metal mines, the other one is of course potentially helping some of these producers transact in M&A transactions -- are those still 2 of the key sort of sources of opportunities coming up?"

So, I would say M&A cosmos is probably slowed down a little bit in terms of funding acquisitions, probably more, what you're seeing is base metals producers and another theme, I would point to is that existing precious metals, royalties are increasingly on the market.

But as we've all seen precious metal gold prices have increased, record high silver prices have increased, has it made it more difficult for you to price some of these deals in that -- as Paul mentioned, these are competitive situations, our producers asking for some of these deals to be priced at spot and would you pay spot?"

How about your other NPIs you're the one Kirkland Lake and the one Goldstrike. Do we expect again the same type of leverage on a go-forward basis and some of those NPIs as well. And are there any other NPIs am I might have missed?"

So I think for the foreseeable future that will be minimal -- Goldstrike just again, it's only applied to certain claims. It will depend upon what flows through, I think a $2,000 goal, you will start to see the leverage come through at the Goldstrike NPI, but the one we are looking forward to is [indiscernible] where we do have a 5% NPI, obviously [indiscernible] was impacted by the fire last year, but it is up and running and that NPI hopefully starting next year, will start to kick in revenue again. So that will probably have the most meaningful impact versus Hemlo."

As you've mentioned earlier today, you talked about East Gouldie zone and potentially some of the other underground zones as well. Could you maybe remind us, this is likely on your website, but could you remind us in terms of, for example, our East Gouldie to 2.7 million ounces and underground resources. How much do you have -- how much of that is on your royalty ground, in terms of the other deposits, Odyssey, East Malartic, what do you have in terms of total resources that could be attributable back to Franco-Nevada."

The -- probably the best place to look is in our asset handbook, where we do have a schematic that shows the position as we understand it of East Gouldie relative to our royalty claims, the recall at Malartic, we have a couple of individual claims we don't call, cover all of the property, but you will see there our best estimate of the portion of East Gouldie that we cover and we do potentially touch on some of the other areas, but East Gouldie is probably the likely area where we'll get more answers.

Right now, you're looking at, I believe, $40 per barrel and $2 per Mcf in terms of -- I believe that's Henry Hub. You know, clearly those numbers, those assumptions are pretty good at this point in time, but Jason, could you remind us in terms of the sensitivity to commodity prices and who knows, it might actually go up from where it is today, if we have more of a V-shape recovery. So I just want to get understanding in terms of your sensitivity to [indiscernible] and also natural gas prices."

It's Jason here and you're right, there is some leverage to revenue from a rising commodity prices, we have leverage in our Canadian operations, mostly through our Weyburn NRI and also some through the Orion royalty. And then in our US assets, we have leverage that comes from really from increase in drilling and activity as operators on our lands in the US ramp up their development pace.",
            "It's very hard to give you an exact number ratio for leverage right now, we're waiting to see as the prices come back what response the operators have in terms of increasing their capital budgets and increasing their development pace. So I think as the prices settle out here and become more consistent, we'll probably get a better idea over the next couple of quarters as to what a rise in commodity price would be for activity risks in the US and then we'll be able to give you a better leverage number to work offloads.",

I think what you saw when the oil price crashed in April was a real pullback from E&P companies in terms of the amount of dollars they we're putting into the ground in drilling and development. As the price rebounce here, there will be a point where operators start to recommence that capital, but we just have to follow -- we obviously don't have the visibility into operators plans and we'll have to wait for them to start to be committing that capital before we have a better idea of how that impacts production going forward."

You obviously had a huge disruptive event that happened where operators cut capital significantly. If they curtailed production, they really trimmed their development plans. We've just recently come back up to $40. And I think E&P companies are still a little bit reluctant to really increase their capital budgets. Most of them, if you look at what they've been saying publicly is that they plan over the next year or so at these types of price $40 or so to try to keep their production reasonably flat or may be introduce a very low rate of growth on the order of not to 5%. Nobody out there right now is talking about growth of 20% or 25% like they were at higher prices. I think that's going to take time, you're going to see you're going to see more sustained higher prices before you would expect those kind of growth rates to come back. So at $40 I think right now in the market that's a recipe for operators to kind of maintain production profiles at a reasonably flat level."

If drilling and development continue at a slower pace, there is less acreage available to buy on the ground in favorable places and if that's the case, we may slow our commitment there, but that's a question we haven't really addressed of Continental yet will have to wait to later in the year before we determine what the appropriate level of spending next year should be."

And yes, you've got your deal with Continental, which regulates how you do things, but philosophically, should we -- would we be surprised we saw enter at oil deal with someone else going forward. I'm just trying to philosophically see back to where you'd be allocating capital, and I realize it depends on what deals come available, but you've talked about doing energy, base metal, precious metals that on a counter-cyclical basis maybe oil is the right thing to do right now."

But in the other commodities, we try and be opportunistic, the general criteria there for the other commodities are, is it a good deposits. That's the number one driver. But if we're doing deals outside of gold. We also say, how do we justify that that is a better deal than we could do in the gold space and some ingredients go into that is I think of jurisdictions, current cash flow and also for those other commodities are we'd be an opportunistic -- do we never going to get the timing absolutely right, but for those other commodities, we want to believe that we are in the lower half of the commodity price cycle when we do that. So as any deal comes forward, those are the criteria that we look at and you're absolutely right.
