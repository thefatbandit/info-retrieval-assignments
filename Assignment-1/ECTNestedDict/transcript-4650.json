      "Ignacio Cuenca Arambarri": [
         "[Foreign Language] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, we would like to offer a warm welcome to all of you who have joined us today for our 2020 first half results presentation. And more important, we hope that you, your family, friends and colleagues are all safe and well during this global pandemic.",
         "Now on to the reason why we are all here, our H1 results presentation, which will follow our normal format. Firstly, we will begin with an overview of the results and the main developments during the period given by the senior executive team that we usually have with us. Our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Ignacio Gal\u00e1n; Mr. Francisco Martinez Corcoles, Business CEO; and finally, the CFO, Mr. Jose S\u00e1inz.",
         "Following this, we will move on to the Q&A session. I would also like to highlight that we are only going to take questions submitted via the web. So please ask your question only through our web page, www.iberdrola.com. Additionally, we expect that today\u2019s event will not last more than 60 minutes. Hoping that this presentation will be useful and informative for all of you, now without further ado, I would like to give the floor to our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Ignacio Galan. Thank you very much again. Please, Mr. Gal\u00e1n."
      ],
      "Ignacio Gal\u00e1n": [
         "Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for joining today\u2019s conference call. Over the last month, we have gone through some of the most challenging times in our lives. Fortunately, in Europe, the spread of the virus is now widely under control and other geographies are also showing positive signs. I hope you and your families stay well.",
         "The confinement measures that had to be implemented as a consequence of COVID-19 are having a profound economy impact. And now probably the main challenge we have ahead is to contribute to a quick and sustained results share recovery.",
         "Our first priority in these months has continued being the safety and welfare of all our employees, customers and society as a large. From the donation of health care materials worth more than \u20ac30 million to the authorities of the countries we operate, to the service to millions of people who depend of our operation to power the houses and businesses, I am proud to say we have delivered on our responsibilities.",
         "Thanks to the dedication and professionalism of all our employees who have always put their duties first, quality indicators has remained at normal levels during the crisis, and we have guaranteed the supply to critical infrastructures. My most sincere gratitude to all the women and men who work for Iberdrola Group, especially those who have been in the field over this month. They all make this company outstanding. Building on our investment in digitalization and technology, we have put in place all the necessary precaution measures to maintain our operations and now to enable a safe return to the workplace.",
         "I am glad to say that just a few days ago, the international certification company, AENOR, has granted the Iberdrola Group a global quality certificate for the comprehensive system of measures we have put in place to manage the effect from COVID on all our stakeholders and especially of all our employees. As a consequence of these measures, employee infection rates has been much lower than the average rate in the countries where we operate, in some cases, up to 10 times lower. However, we have suddenly suffered the loss of two employees worldwide. Our thoughts and our support are for \u2013 with their families.",
         "Now it\u2019s our responsibility to go back to normality, always in a safe manner and in line with local regulation applicable. In Continental Europe, we have already completed the reentry plans and all our employees are back in the office, which have been adapted to ensure social distancing. And similar plans are progressing in other geographies with approximately 50% of our office staff already in workplace in UK and United States, for example.",
         "The commitment of our workforce at solar ANEEL enable us to maintain our ambition investment program. Despite lockdown measures in the first half, we increased investment compared to 2019, which as you know, was already a record year reaching \u20ac3.6 billion in just six months. The close collaboration to our supply chains has been essential to achieve this. In order to help our suppliers maintain their activity and provide them the visibility they require up to June, we have awarded contracts totaling \u20ac7 billion to them.",
         "Since the outbreak of this crisis, we have also focused on keeping security supply to the home industries we serve in all countries. Implementing measures to protect the special vulnerable group, including a free-of-charge service for in-home electric repairs, enabling a special energy service channel for them. It is our commitment to continue navigating this situation in full compliance with our model, which seeks to balance and maximize the interest on all our stakeholders, including, of course, our hundreds of thousands of shareholders.",
         "And in the first half of 2020, we have delivered once again increasing the results. 2020 adjusted EBITDA with the skewed COVID impact exceed \u20ac5 billion, which is a 4.2% increase year-on-year. Including COVID impact, reported EBITDA reaches \u20ac4,118 million.",
         "Over the quarter, we have continued executing our plan. As mentioned, investment reached \u20ac3.6 billion year-to-date. From April to June, even with lockdown in many of our countries, we have managed to increase investment versus first quarter. We\u2019ve also continued improving efficiency with net operating expenses down 3% \u2013 3.3% year-on-year. And we have reinforced our financial position thanks to our full access to market, having even increased our liquidity.",
         "In the last month, we have continued reinforcing our growth potential in the medium and long-term through transactions in Australia, France and Sweden, which create new development platforms for the company as well as with the new addition to our pipeline of renewable project, which is now close to 60,000 megawatts, reaffirming our unique position as first runners in the global transition to clean energy. This leadership is recognized by ESG agencies and specialist investors, which ranked Iberdrola among the top performers.",
         "All in all, adjusted net profit rose by 7.5%, and reported net profit, which includes minus \u20ac153 million of COVID-19 impact and the federal UK government decision to maintain corporate tax rate at 90% as well as capital gains from divestment reached \u20ac1,845 million, up 12% versus previous year.",
         "Focusing now on group operating performance, adjusted EBITDA increased by 4.2% to \u20ac5,075 million, thanks to the positive evolution of Renewables and Generation and Supply. Renewables EBITDA was up more than 5% due to the contribution of new capacity installed over the last three months mainly in UK, thanks to East Anglia ONE offshore wind farm now fully commissioned.",
         "The increase in production at the state driven by new capacity and the normalization of the wind resource and the improvement achieved in the availability our \u2013 this fleet as well as the increase of hydro production in Spain and Brazil by hydro reserve in Spain stand at more than 7.5 terawatt hours, 60% above previous year levels.",
         "Generation and Supply EBITDA reflects an increase in production as well as the impact of price hedge and lower procurement cost. In addition, despite market situation and still challenging result in UK. Improved significantly year-on-year, thanks to the adjustment made in the tariff cap methodology in the fourth quarter 2019. However, additional adjustment will be required in the coming months to reflect the impact of COVID-19.",
         "Finally, network result continued to be affected by the transition to the new regulatory period in Spain, which we expect it to be offset in the future by the higher asset base, especially if the government continues to increase the investment cap was adjusted very slightly in a few months ago.",
         "In United States, despite the stable result in U.S. GAAP driven by the positive effect from the new rate cases in Connecticut and Maine, EBITDA in IFRS has been impacted by temporary adjustment related to the deviation in demand and energy cost versus assumption. As you know, these amounts are fully recognized as regulatory asset, and therefore, will be recovered in the future with positive impact in consolidated results in future as well.",
         "In Brazil, aside from tariff reviews, a higher efficiencies more than compensate foreign exchange evolution. All in all, COVID-19 has a total impact of \u20ac157 million at EBITDA level. The operating situation we were standing to suffer due to the pandemic when we held the last result presentation in Generation and Retail market in Spain, UK in April is gradually normalizing. Monthly power demand has been consistently recovering by around 1.1% per week, moving in Spain from minus 18% in April, minus 25% during the worst week, to minus 5% in July. As a result, we are reaching levels closer to those registered before the crisis.",
         "Similarly, 2021 forward prices are moving upwards, having increased by around \u20ac5 per megawatt hour in the last month. In any case, all our production for 2020 and most of 2021 output is already hedged. Regarding customer debt at Retail business, total rolling credit costs stand at 0.94% of total sales, 30 basis points above usual levels. Our CFO will give more details later on.",
         "In our regulated business, COVID-19 impacts are expected to be mostly covered by regulatory framework, and we have made significant progress over last month in United States and Brazil. In United States, we fill a joint proposal with the staff of the commission and 21 parties more for a new three years rate case in New York, which will imply more than doubling our investment in the state at a return of equity of around 9%, also improving cost recovery, for instance in the case of storm and vegetation management. We expect final approval by the Board \u2013 of the regulator in October with full compensation of the delay of target adjustment from April to November. United States regulators are also launching initiatives to track all related expenses in order to allow recovery in the future years.",
         "In Brazil, an agreement was also reached to recover extra cost related COVID-19 through end of balance sheet loan that will imply BRL 1,660 million for Neoenergia and an extraordinary tariff review is also already under negotiation that we expect will be finalized after summer. Thanks to all regulatory adjustment, we expect to recover most costs related to COVID between 2020 and the following years.",
         "The current circumstances have also led us to an extra effort on cost rationalization having achieved a decrease at net operating expenses of 3.3% to \u20ac2,074 million even after the inclusion of \u20ac33 million of one-off expenses mainly due to donation of medical equipment like ventilators related to COVID-19. All in all, the ratio net operating expenses to gross margin improved by 30 basis points year-on-year to 25.8%.",
         "As mentioned, gross investment reached \u20ac3,582 million, driven by Networks and Renewables with increases about 4% in both cases. This business contributes to 90% of total gross investment. Lower investment in Generation and Supply, partially related to the slowdown of new commercial activity fell by 17%.",
         "Let me highlight once again that quarter-on-quarter, our investment increased by 7% despite the lockdown in most countries. This lead us to maintain our expectation to invest close to \u20ac10 billion in 2020. In terms of new capacity up to June, we have commissioned 1,600 megawatts, and we continue with our plans to install over 2,000 megawatt in the second half of the year, including close to 100 megawatt in Spain with nine project under advanced construction; 500-megawatt in the United States, where we have seven project progressing, with the rest corresponding to UK, Mexico and other countries. We saw in the last 12 months, we have installed almost 5,000 megawatt and we have more than 7,500 megawatts already under construction for commercial operations mostly before 2021 year-end.",
         "Operating cash flow also grew in the first half, reaching \u20ac3,922 million, allowing us to combine the acceleration of reinvestment with the reinforcement of our financial external liquidity. Our FFO to adjusted net debt ratio stand at 21.7%, an improvement of 110 basis points versus 12 months ago.",
         "In terms of access of capital market, despite the overall contraction of serving the debt market, in the last two quarters, we have been able to issue \u20ac2,600 million of new green and sustainable financing, driving group total sustainable finances to close to \u20ac23 billion now.",
         "Following this performance, credit agencies have recently confirmed the ratings for Iberdrola. This comfortable financial position allow us to continue looking for growth opportunity through the greenfield acquisition of the addition of new project to our pipeline. In both case, we are following the same strategy of the last two decades, integrating new companies in new countries and transforming them into platform for organic growth. That was the case in UK, United States and Brazil, where we have multiply investment by two or even by three since the integration in the group.",
         "In the last month, we have announced three transaction that replicate this model. In Australia, we are already have a 300-megawatt wind and solar fiber project under construction. And following one year of conversation, we launched the friendly takeover bid for Infigen, one of the country\u2019s large renewable developers and a company with a strong customer portfolio and deep know-how of the Australian PPI market. This company will add 1,100 megawatt to our installed capacity and a growing pipeline of project which today has already more than 1,000 megawatts.",
         "In France, we have reinforced our presence in the onshore wind market through the integration of Aalto Power, a renewable operator with 800 megawatt in operation of advanced development. Additionally, we have become 100% owners of the company developing the Saint-Brieuc offshore wind farm, which is 496 megawatt, as you know, which is progressing well to reach commercial operation by 2023.",
         "In offshore wind, we have also closed a transaction that create huge potential opportunity for the next decade in Sweden, a country with a clear plan of substituting nuclear power with renewables in the late 2020s and 2030s, reaching a project portfolio up to 9,000 megawatts that could start operating from 2099, putting us in a position that reminds me what we did in UK 10 years ago when the East Anglia fund action was held.",
         "On these projects we further reinforce our renewable pipeline, which as today reaches 58,000 megawatt. 60% of these project are located in the United States and Spain. In United States, we have 20,000 megawatt in total, out of which 7,500 are offshore wind; 5,000 megawatt offshore wind; and 8,500 solar foot double take.",
         "In Spain, over the last year, we have increased our pipeline by 30% to reach 14,000 megawatt of solar photovoltaic and onshore wind. The remaining 40% is spread over Brazil, Mexico, Continental Europe, UK, where we have already, as you know, 4,500 megawatt of offshore wind project and the rest of the world. Out of this total, we already had 7,000 megawatt of renewable capacity under construction, 80% which will be finalized by 2021 with 1,000 megawatt of onshore in Brazil completed in 2022 and the Saint-Brieuc offshore wind project in 2023. Additionally, we have 14,000 megawatt, which already had permits, most of which will be operating by 2024 and 37,000 megawatts more of pipeline in earliest stage of development we will mature from 2025.",
         "Let me highlight our pilot in an offshore wind, which amounts 12,000 megawatt in United States, UK and Continental Europe, with full seabed rights before including the transaction of Sweden. In order to assess the dimension of offshore wind pipeline, it\u2019s essential to understand that offshore wind generate around five times the build-up per megawatt of other renewable technologies like, for example, solar photovoltaic. You see Iberdrola taking a leading role in the acceleration phase we are entering. All countries are taking multiple measure to anticipate the investment in many cases driven by reconstruction plans.",
         "In Europe, the European Commission presented the long-term buyer for the period 2021 to 2027 for \u20ac1.1 trillion and the next-generation new recovery plan with an allocation of \u20ac750 billion, which \u2013 of which more than half, \u20ac390 billion, will be subsidies with the rest B loans with the different levels of conditionality, depending on countries. Close to \u20ac460 billion, that is more than 25% of the combined amount, will be dedicated to green and climate-related investments.",
         "In Spain, the government has submitted the revised National Climate Energy Plan to Brazil and is also reaffirming the green ambition with a climate change and energy transition bill that is currently being discussed at Congress. In UK, the grid recovery fund was already approved. In the United States, around $3 trillion were approved by the federal government to provide relief in a wide range of areas which respond to COVID pandemic. A new PTC extension was also passed with five years of safe harbor. At the state level, we continue to see more and more ambition green target. For instance, New York has set an objective to reach 70% of renewal energy by 2030, with the coming offshore wind actions, and Virginia has also increased offshore wind actions.",
         "Finally, in Brazil, an economic stimulus package was approved for around BRL 750 billion. As we anticipated in last result presentation, we are currently executing new Iberdrola Retribuci\u00f3n Flexible program, which will amount to at least \u20ac0.232 per share, either in cuts of shares and will be paid on the 4th of August. Adding up the interim dividend paid in February, total shareholder remuneration amounts \u20ac0.40 per share, reaching already the floor set for 2022, three years in advance, reaffirming our model that seeks to create sustainable value for all our stakeholder, including, of course, our shareholders.",
         "A model that has made us a best-in-class company in ESG investors. After 20 years anticipating the transition to green and a more sustainable energy system, today, prestigious international entities, such as ROBECOSAM or MSCI are giving us the highest rating and the largest investment fund in the world. BlackRock considered our bond as dark green, the highest green bond rating.",
         "Just a few days ago, we signed a new facility with the European Investment Bank and the ICO \u20ac800 million, driving the total green and sustainable financing in the group for more than \u20ac22 billion now.",
         "I will now hand over to the CFO who will present the group financial result in more detail. Thank you.",
         "Thank you, Pepe. To conclude, over the last six months probably in the most challenging scenario indicates, Iberdrola has continued growing. And we have achieved this reaffirming the same model we have been implementing for 20 years. A model based on social market economy, on a strong belief of the benefit of balancing the long-term interest of employees, shareholders and societies as a large.",
         "In moment like this, everyone needs to move from words to action. And the 40,000 employees of Iberdrola have proven their willingness to do it. Maintaining electricity supply with absolute normality in all our countries; providing visibility to our suppliers so that they can preserve jobs with \u20ac7 billion awarded in just six months; dedicating \u20ac33 million to the purchase and donation of health suppliers in the countries we are at present; and progressing in the execution of our investment plan.",
         "Despite all restriction, we have started the construction of 350 new megawatt this month. And year-on-year, we have completed close to 5,000 megawatts, increasing our total installed capacity for more than 53,000 megawatt, almost 2/3 of which are Renewables.",
         "We have been able to combine this growth with efficiency measures, driving the net operating expenses down by 3.3% and with a strong financial position, as shown by all our solvency ratios and our available liquidity with the exist \u20ac14 billion. Reported net profit grew 12% to \u20ac1,845 million, despite the negative impact of \u20ac553 million as a consequence of COVID-19.",
         "For the rest of the year, we are confident that we will continue to perform according to our plans. We maintain our target to invest \u20ac10 billion in the year, installing totally 4,000 megawatt of new capacity. Results will also be supported by tariff reviews in Brazil and especially by the new rate cases in New York, which we expect to close in October with retroactive effect from April. And we will continue putting in place new efficiency measures.",
         "We have lived three months of a sharp contraction in economic activity. But our diversified business model has proven once again our capacity to resist external shocks. These are unprecedented times. And despite seeing clear signs of improvement in power prices, demand and overdue debt, it\u2019s still early to be certain about the evolution in the coming months.",
         "As explained earlier, regulators in all our market are also working on measures to mitigate impact. Taking all this into account, we are today maintaining our net profit guidance at mid-high single-digit growth with even growing in line with the net profit. We still have significant challenge ahead, but you can be sure that everyone in Iberdrola will continue to rise to them.",
         "Thank you very much. And now we reply your questions."
      ],
      "Jos\u00e9 Sainz": [
         "Thank you, Chairman. Good morning to everybody. I will now go through the results. I would like to start explaining the two main COVID impacts considered in our accounts totaling \u20ac228 million at the EBIT level. \u20ac157 million related to demand decrease, affecting both Generation and Supply up to \u20ac92 million, and Network business, \u20ac65 million. As I was saying, this is the \u20ac157 million goes at EBITDA level. And another \u20ac71 million of bad debt accounted for as provisions, reducing our EBIT: \u20ac35 million in the Network business and \u20ac36 million in Generation and Supply.",
         "In Networks, as the Chairman has said, we are expecting recovery of most of the impacts through the regulatory mechanisms. And in Generation and Supply, bad debt impacts will be managed through our commercial activity. And as also the Chairman has pointed out, we have submitted a proposal for recognition of impacts in the SVT tariff into the UK regulator.",
         "Our reported first half EBITDA decreased 1.4% to \u20ac4,918 million. Total adjusted EBITDA is up 4.2%. FX lowered our EBITDA by another \u20ac92 million related basically to the real evolution that has depreciated 19% against the euro during this period. The dollar rose around 3%, and the sterling was flat. Reported net profit was 12.2% up to \u20ac1,845 million and adjusted net profit is up 7.5%.",
         "Our adjusted results, already advanced by the Chairman, as we have explained already in the Q1, exclude the most relevant non-recurring items, both in 2019 and 2020 first half, but not \u2013 but does not consider any FX impact. As you can see in the slide, 2020 first half adjusted EBITDA is \u20ac5,075 million, excluding the \u20ac157 million COVID demand effect. First half 2019 adjusted EBITDA was \u20ac4,868 million instead of the \u20ac4,990 million reported as it excludes \u20ac121 million of non-recurring, \u20ac89 million from our LNG contract sales that we did in the second quarter of 2019 and \u20ac33 million from settlements in the Spanish networks. As a consequence, adjusted EBITDA grew 4.2% instead of the 1.4% fall reported.",
         "If we would have added the FX impact, \u20ac92 million, our adjusted EBITDA would have grown 6.1%. Adjusted net profit of \u20ac1,670 million instead of the \u20ac1,845 million reported exclude all the COVID net impacts in our accounts, \u20ac153 million, net of impacts; the already mentioned on EBITDA level; and another \u20ac71 million of bad debt net of taxes.",
         "Adjusted net profit also exclude the \u20ac485 million of the Gamesa gain and another minus \u20ac157 million of non-recurring negative tax impacts, mainly due to the UK deferred tax impact as they did not reduce the tax rate to 17% from 19%. As a result, adjusted net profit grew 7.5% instead of the 12.2% growth reported.",
         "Revenues fell 9.9% due \u2013 to \u20ac16.5 billion, impacted by COVID and weather-related lower demand. And procurements fell 16.3%, reaching \u20ac8.4 billion. As a consequence, gross margin was down 2.2% to \u20ac8 billion, also affected negative by \u20ac121 million of negative FX impact.",
         "Net operating expenses improved by 3.3% to \u20ac2.1 billion. The improvement in net operating expenses is driven by cost containment and efficiency plan. Positive FX impact compensates the \u20ac33 million of donations and other expenses related to COVID accounted for in the second quarter.",
         "Levies fell by 3.4% to \u20ac1,057 million with lower output and prices in Spain being a key factor to this evolution. As you can see in the slide, Spanish taxes on generation improved \u20ac28 million.",
         "Analyzing the results of the different business and starting by Networks, its EBITDA fell by 10.6% to \u20ac2.3 billion, considering \u20ac65 million negative COVID impact on demand and \u20ac140 million \u20ac130 million of IFRS accounting effects in the U.S. that will start to be recovered from the second half of this year onwards.",
         "As you can see in the slide, Spain contributed 34%; the U.S., 23%; Brazil reached 21%, and the UK contributed another 21%. In Spain, EBITDA fell 5.5% to \u20ac791 million due to a 50 basis points lower remuneration for this year, bringing down revenues by \u20ac29 million and the impact of the mentioned \u20ac33 million of positive settlements accounted for in the first half of 2019. Net operating expenses and taxes improved, compensating partially this fall.",
         "In the U.S., IFRS EBITDA was 25% down to $588 million, driven by $142 million negative temporary adjustments under IFRS as a consequence of difference in volumes and energy cost due to an extremely mild winter and storms that appeared in the second quarter. Most of these negative impacts will start to be recovered during the second half of this year and following years. U.S. GAAP EBITDA, excluding those accounting translation impacts, decreased just 0.9% or $144 million more than the IFRS EBITDA reported.",
         "In Brazil, EBITDA grew 4.2% to BRL 2.6 billion. Tariffs revisions in Coelba and Cosern from April and in Elektro from August, increasing contribution from transmission assets and cost contention due to efficiency plans have been almost compensated by BRL 150 million of COVID impact on demand, expected to be recovered mostly in the third quarter of this year. A BRL 1.7 billion COVID account as a balance sheet and as an off-balanced loan for NEO has already been approved by AML.",
         "Finally, in the UK, EBITDA was 3.3% up to \u00a3431 million, with higher revenues both in transmission and distribution as a consequence of the growing asset base due to investments, partially offset by \u00a320 million less revenues due to lower demand to be recovered in 2022.",
         "Renewables EBITDA grew 5.3% to \u20ac1.2 billion, driven by the growth in the UK and the U.S. and despite weak conditions in the second quarter. Nevertheless, hydro conditions were good, and our level of reserve increased 55% year-on-year. Our average operating capacity increased 6.1% and our total installed capacity reached close to 33,000 megawatts or an increase of close to 8%.",
         "In Spain, EBITDA was \u20ac301 million, 21% below last year despite an 18% higher output due to 51% higher hydro production or whereas higher PV capacity. But this was more than compensated by lower prices in our sales to our supply business.",
         "In the U.S., EBITDA increased 12.4% to $313 million, caused by a 21% higher output following the 791 megawatts increase in operating capacity and a higher wind resource and higher availability of our fleet.",
         "In the UK, EBITDA was 54% up to \u00a3329, with higher contribution both in offshore onshore, 12% higher and offshore, especially, 270% more as a result of the East Anglia production which is ramping up as its 740 megawatts are already in operation. In Brazil, EBITDA decreased 12.6% to BRL 269 million, with 7.8% lower output and prices normalizing versus last year extraordinary high levels.",
         "In Mexico, EBITDA decreased 14% to $39 million as a consequence of an 8% lower output. Finally, in the international business, mainly in Europe, EBITDA fell 3.4% to \u20ac177 million due to higher development costs as business expands.",
         "Generation and Supply EBITDA was up 14.3% to \u20ac1.3 billion, including \u20ac92 million negative impact of COVID on demand. In Spain, the EBITDA was up 8% to \u20ac813 million, with 16% lower output, both higher purchases at lower prices versus first half of last year. We continue our active management of our customer portfolio of energy and smart solutions. There are, as I mentioned, \u20ac89 million negative non-recurring from our LNG contract sale accounted for in the second quarter of last year.",
         "In Mexico, the EBITDA grew 3.7% to $423 million, thanks to higher sales as a consequence of an 8% increase \u2013 production increase, partially compensated by a lower availability of one of our plants.",
         "In the UK, the EBITDA grew 130% to \u00a3112 million after SVT tariff was adjusted upwards. Some COVID impacts on demand are being negotiated to included on the 2021 SVT review.",

Are we correct that there has been a small change of language of the guidance, now mid-high single-digit growth instead of previously high? Is it just the impact of COVID? Or is there something else driving the small shift? Does the update guidance mid-high single-digit growth in net profit includes or not the capital gains from the Siemens Gamesa stake? Are you downgrading your guidance? Are you comfortable with full year Bloomberg consensus of \u20ac3.6 billion net income?"

            "Today, the situation is different. The COVID, we know now what has been the impact in our accounts at net profit level represent \u20ac153 million. \u20ac153 million roughly in \u2013 represent 4% to 5% of our annual net profit. So looking forward the full year, it should depends very much about certain factors, as I comment. What is going to be \u2013 there are good signs of stabilization of the demand and power prices. But we don\u2019t know what is to be the future evolution, depending how you\u2019re going to be the COVID behavior in the next month.",
            "Similarly, I think we are collaborating actively with the regulators. We expect recover partially this impact. But I think we are in talks with them, still, we are not already confirmed for \u2013 to recover during this year. So that why, I feel, in summary, our position is that we continue in delivering increased result.",
            "But depending on the evolution of those factors, we could grow something like a mid-or high single digit. I think the fact today, this \u20ac153 million represent 5% or almost 5%, 4% to 5% of our expected net profit. So I think we\u2019ll recover completely that one. The number should be the one. We complete it. Partially, it should be another one. If we succeed already in the negotiation with regulators to be registered this year, certain of these expenses in the account of the year, the results will be one. If we are not succeeding, if we would register the following year, the results will be another one.",
            "So there are too many uncertainties around. Then it\u2019s impossible to say what is going to make. So \u2013 but what is important is to say that our expectation is to continue delivering increasing results, which I think indeed in the certainty period in we are living, I feel is really something very, very important to be said. So there are areas in which we are already \u2013 is in our hands, I think, we are now has to increase the power. The installed power is in our hands already \u2013 almost in our hands to get already the confirmation of our rate cases on New York. It\u2019s in our hands already to reduce already our expenses. But there are areas which is not in our hands, I insist on that one.",
            "So I think if any of you, you can guarantee me that there is going not to be another infection, important infection in autumn, so \u2013 but I think now we are not sure then that cannot happen. We have already passed the worst period. And in the worst period, our net profit is growing by 12%. So \u2013 and that is what I can already tell you for the time being."

So I think there are positive things, which is new rate cases, which is going to be already from April is \u2013 we are already \u2013 this study will be retroactive in April.",

            "I think they have already recognized during these two years that our draft, our proposal, they recognize the best investment plan of those of other networks companies. And until very recent days, Ofgem has pointed publicly to average return around 4.8, so plus 14 incentives. And suddenly, they modified that 1 at 3.9 with no incentive or little incentive. I think also, I think this \u2013 and especially as well surprise because this proposal goes against the government priorities and policies.",
            "The government priorities and policies is saying that they would like to increase investment infrastructures. And this proposal is reducing investment in infrastructures. This is already \u2013 the government would like to increase the need of new jobs, and that is going in the opposite direction. If it\u2019s less investment, it\u2019s going to be less job involved from that one.",
            "Then the government is already \u2013 the policy is net sale of target. And they are trying for these to increase electrification of the economy. With less investment, we are preventing the electrification of the economy. And I think the \u2013 if there are less certification, the emission is going to increase. And all this mess has been generating just because an extra cost for consumer but less than \u00a31 per customer per annum.",
            "So I don\u2019t know how in the regulated activities, how to mobilize the investment required if there are not a stability and predictability. A regulatory sector is not a sector you can give surprises, and that is a surprise. So you have to imagine the investment we are making in this is a stand for over 40 years. So I think we have to take a decision for the next 40 years.",
            "We\u2019ve been investing heavily in the last years in the realty one, expecting a continuity in the terms and the condition, of course, adjusted to the circumstances, but continuity. And therefore, I think if the \u2013 if they are not already predictability, I don\u2019t know how we can already convince investors and to raise money for making already the investment the country require.",
            "I\u2019m sure that then is so strange, all we have already happened, that we will find out a solution. I\u2019m sure the government of UK has been very clear about the climate policies and goals. And I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to help already to move in this direction. Trade unions as well, British trade unions, are very surprised. They are already calling for a solution to protect the houses of jobs, not only in our companies, in the companies and their suppliers. I think we\u2019ve been developing during the last eight years a British supply chain with employees based on a thousands of people without putting the jobs at risk. So \u2013 and that is reasonable. The trade unions are already worried for what can already happen.",

So far, setting a part of all noise, the only measure which is confirmed with impact to Iberdrola has been the increase in transmission cost for renewables, which in the case of Iberdrola has a small impact in our financial result.

We have already thousands of megawatt in construction of \u2013 in advanced stage for starting construction rapidly. And I feel certain that it\u2019s an opportunity of acceleration. I think that is what we are making last year and this year, accelerating new construction in that one.",

I think there are certain things which are already helping on this direction is the improvisation of the existing power plant. I think we can use the existing transmission with \u2013 we can hybridize and putting beside the existing power plant, another one of Renewables with that are already helping because it\u2019s not needed to build a new transmission infrastructure about pushing infrastructure for making that one. So that give already an opportunity of acceleration of the investment and opportunity of increasing the investment in the country. The details, 11th of November."

So I think that is fully realistic. 14,000, which is with permit. So those one is going to start construction. I\u2019ve mentioned some during this year and the rest during next year. So I think all these two probably will be all of them completed prior of 2023, 2024. And this one with permits in process, I think most of them is will be mature from 2024 onwards.",

And we have to do something to secure the service to absorb the fixed cost that the system have.",

If it\u2019s needed, some system have to be introduced in order then that will be compensating the manner to maintain this one the activity in those ones.",

So the objective of the carbon issues, Europe are so clear that there are certain processes which can be electrified, but there are things which cannot be electrified. I think it\u2019s easy to electrify the electric bacon, it\u2019s easy to electrify the cooling and heating of the homes, but it\u2019s not easy to make another thing to electrify. For instance, to production of ammonia.",

I think they make the process where they call steam reform and where they generate CO2 which emitted to the atmosphere, and they are already generating a hydrogen with this hydrogen is used already for this process.",
            "So that can be transformed. And I think in like that one, there are several process for heavy transport. Same thing as well for heavy transport, probably today, still is not the most competitive thing to use already batteries the export with trucks of a vessel with battery. But I think probably with hydrogen is a good solution.",
            "That\u2019s why I think what they are already promoted is very easy. All those things which can be already electrified have to be electrified. The hard thing had to be used for those processes, which cannot be electrified, but can be already transformed in that one.",
            "And \u2013 but this hydrogen have to generated using already electrolyzers by electrolysis. We\u2019d know through the use of fossil fuels for production. So I think that, that is a positive approach. And for that, I think that it seemed, the gigawatt will be needed on the range of 40,000 megawatt of installed capacity of electrolyzer in this one.",
            "That is a huge amount of electricity generated because it works 24 hours a day. And that\u2019s why we are already aware of that one. And that\u2019s why we have already, just in this moment, launching the first largest project of hydrogen with electrolysis to be made probably in this moment in Europe, but certainly in Spain, which is going to generate this hydrogen inside of fertilizer company using the electricity generated for a photovoltaic power plant, which is close to that one.",

We are \u2013 we see that, that is an opportunity, clear opportunity for energy consumption, clear, clean energy construction in the future and of course, who would like to be in the first \u2013 on the front of this development.",
