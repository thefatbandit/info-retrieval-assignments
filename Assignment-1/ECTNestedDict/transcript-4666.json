      "Jim Thompson": [
         "Thanks, Lisa. Good morning. As Lisa said, our top priority remains the well being of our team, tenants and communities. As of the end of July, 95% of our tenants are open, compared to 75% two months ago. The majority of tenants that have reopened experienced better than anticipated initial success and had been encouraged by consumer reception.",
         "Customers appreciate that retailers are taking extra precautions and measures to help them feel safe and welcomed in their stores. Regency is also working side by side with our tenants, including implementing increased safety and cleanliness procedures and installing enhanced signage and wayfinding. We will continue to make additional modifications and adjustments to help our tenants and their customers feel safe and comfortable.",
         "As highlighted in our business update posted on our website, as of the end of July, we have collected 77% of base rent for Q2, including executed deferrals. Looking beyond quarter end, we have collected 79% of July base rent on that same basis. We are encouraged that July collections have trended ahead of April, May and June as at the same point in time for those respective months.",
         "We have purposely taken a very deliberate approach to negotiating rent deferrals with our tenants. As tenants began opening or have visibility on when they would be able to open, we were in better position to understand their financial needs to open and operate successfully.",
         "Just as important, Regency has been able to obtain certain non-monetary concessions in our deferral agreements, including waiving co-tenancy clauses, lifting use restrictions, extending terms or requiring enhanced sales reporting.",
         "Even with tenants that are still limited on how they can operate due to government orders, such as full service, dining and fitness categories, we are seeing that the better operators are able to adapt to the circumstances and are creative in how they successfully operate their businesses during this time.",
         "For example, we have many nail and hair salons that have extended their normal operating hours in order to accommodate more clients. restaurants that are creatively using additional outdoor areas for seating, such as sidewalks and even parking spaces, and fitness operators that are hosting outdoor classes and adding additional class times to accommodate customer\u2019s modified work-from-home schedules.",
         "At the same time, in certain markets that had reopened, but restrictions have since been put back in place, many tenants are unfortunately experienced a regression in the progress they have made over the last several months.",
         "Just as we did during the initial shutdowns and impose restrictions in March, we will continue to work with these tenants to provide support and flexibility as they navigate the evolving environment.",
         "While our operations teams have been primarily focused on providing support to our 8,000 in place tenants throughout the pandemic, we are also continuing to negotiate and execute new leases with retailers including grocers, off price, banks, home improvement, service users and restaurants.",
         "We signed over 120,000 square feet of new leases this quarter, including a new anchor lease with a home improvement retailer in a former Kmart space in Florida with rent over -- rent growth over 55%.",
         "Although, our net leasing volumes were down this quarter due to limited new leasing activity, it\u2019s worthwhile to mention, that we renewed nearly 1.2 million square feet of leases with positive rent spreads.",
         "While the more -- majority of new leases signed in Q2 or begun pre-COVID, we are seeing tenant interest falling and it terms similar to pre-COVID expectations, while there\u2019s no questions our op team is keenly focused on collecting rents due and papering lease modifications. This hint of new lease interest is energizing to me and certainly our leasing teams. Mike?"

      "Laura Clark": [
         "Good morning. And welcome to Regency\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Chief Investment Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer.",
         "As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future business and financial performance. These are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in our presentation today and on our filings with the SEC.",
         "The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter\u2019s earnings materials, all of which are posted on our Investor Relations website.",
         "Please note that we have provided an additional COVID-19 disclosure in this quarter\u2019s supplemental package and have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information regarding COVID-19 Business Updates and Impacts. Lisa?"
      ],
      "Lisa Palmer": [
         "Thank you, Laura. Good morning, everyone. I hope you\u2019re all doing as well as possible. First, I just want to open and acknowledge and thank the amazing Regency team. I\u2019m extremely proud and grateful for the dedication and commitment our team has demonstrated during this incredibly challenging time.",
         "As we\u2019ve continued to navigate through the last several months, the entire Regency team has prioritized the well being of their fellow team members, our tenants and the people and the communities that our property serve, while also making great progress in assisting tenants with successful re-openings, improved rent collections and rent deferral negotiations.",
         "As states and markets have lifted restrictions over these last few months, we\u2019ve been encouraged by the success that our tenants have experienced. Our base rent collections for the second quarter including executed deferral agreements was 77% and nearly 80% in July. We\u2019ve seen firsthand that as tenants have been able to reopen, consumers are eager to return to some sense of what was once normal and that means resuming some of their prior shopping behaviors.",
         "Despite the progress Regency and our tenants have made, we are keenly aware that there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty ahead. It is so difficult to predict the future and we know that this situation will continue to evolve and maybe more challenging as this disruption is even more prolonged.",
         "We don\u2019t know for how long the virus will continue to spread without an effective treatment or vaccine. We can\u2019t predict how resilient consumers will be or how tenants will be able to adapt and innovate or some tenants will need additional support in order to survive.",
         "But what we do know, as we look towards the future, we are certain of Regency\u2019s combination of unequaled strategic advantages that we\u2019ve worked to build over time. This combination affords us the opportunity to withstand this difficult time and I\u2019m confident that we will emerge well-positioned for future success.",
         "The quality of our geographically diverse portfolio comprised of necessity based retailers has never been more important than it is today. Our development program was a pipeline of exciting value add projects is structured to provide timing and financial flexibility. Our highly engaged team achieving great results while doing business the right way, and perhaps, most importantly, in today\u2019s environment, a balance sheet and liquidity position that was rock solid entering the pandemic, enabling us to absorb the body blows that we\u2019ve endured the past four months.",
         "Given our strong balance sheet and belief that our rent collections will continue to improve over time, our Board again declared payment of our quarterly dividend at the same level. Our ability to continue the dividend at the current level is an output of a strong starting position of a very low payout ratio, combined with actual results that while certainly not up to our historic performance levels appear to not only have stabilized but to also be trending in a positive direction.",
         "Working closely with our Board, we will monitor our financial metrics and projections in addition to economic and industry trends, and we will make future dividend decisions based on the facts and circumstances at that time.",
         "Before handing over to Jim, I\u2019d like to touch on Regency\u2019s continued commitment to corporate responsibility. In addition to our strategic business advantages, Regency has always had a strong set of core values that have guided our business strategy since we were founded over 50 years ago.",
         "Among those core values is a commitment to do what is right, for the environment, our people, our communities and our company. By doing what is right in each of these areas, we\u2019re effectively managing risks and ensuring the success and sustainability of our business.",
         "As I hope you saw in our recently published Annual Corporate Responsibility report, implementation of these initiatives occurs across all departments at Regency and is ingrained in our culture.",
         "I\u2019m confident that this commitment to do what is right along with the combination of our unequal strategic advantages will continue to position Regency to be a leader in the shopping center sector going forward. Jim?"
      ],
      "Mike Mas": [
         "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As we know, Q2 results were meaningfully impacted by rent collections that remained the low pre-pandemic level. To better understand its impact, we\u2019ve enhanced our disclosure in our supplemental and I strongly encourage you to reference those added pages, if you haven\u2019t already.",
         "I\u2019m going to focus my comments on uncollected rents and specifically how those amounts are recognized in our results, both earnings and same property NOI. And I\u2019ll finish with some comments on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Given continued uncertainty, we will not be providing forward looking guidance at this time.",
         "Uncollected pro-rata rents and recoveries billed in the second quarter totaled over $84 million. Following an extensive collectability review, based on a multitude of factors including credit rating, location and chain performance, tenant category, tenant communications and a host of other relevant inputs, we deemed nearly 50% of these rents, even if contractually deferred as likely to be uncollectible.",
         "To use a more common description, we\u2019re accounting for these receivables on a cash basis. Meaning the income was not recognized in the quarter and will only be recognized as revenue when and if cash received.",
         "The balance of the uncollected pro-rata rents and recoveries billed in the second quarter, approximately $44 million was from tenants with financial and operational attributes, warranting being accrued as revenue and carried as a receivable at quarter end. Again, this includes rents that were contractually deferred.",
         "Importantly, when including accrued rents and recoveries, together with collected billings, Regency has recognized revenue in the second quarter, equating to 86% of total quarterly billings and other income.",
         "The uncollectible lease income charged this quarter. Again, moving tenants to a cash basis of accounting also resulted in a reversal of previously recorded straight line rent. On a non-cash basis, this negatively impacted the second quarter by approximately $19 million. Together, current quarter uncollectible lease income charges are impacting NAREIT FFO by $0.35 per share.",
         "Moving to the balance sheet, during the quarter we took additional measures to enhance our already strong liquidity position by issuing $600 million of 10-year bonds and repaying the defensive draw we made on our line of credit in Q1 bring in our line capacity back to a full $1.2 billion.",
         "As of quarter end, we are carrying approximately $600 million of cash on hand. Together, with our earnings announcement, we also noticed our intent to redeem the entirety of our $300 million of bonds maturing in 2022.",
         "The stronger than anticipated rent collection rates in the quarter, combined with the progress we are making on tenant negotiations, gives us confidence to use the material portion of our cash balances to retire this near-term debt and eliminate the added interest expense.",
         "We continue to have a $265 million term loan outstanding maturing in 2022 and we will monitor our progress and the evolving retail landscape over the next several months before deciding to retire any additional near-term obligations.",
         "With our line of credit fully available and our pro forma cash balances following the bond redemption, we remain very well-positioned with over $1.5 billion of liquidity more than covering development, redevelopment commitments and debt maturities through 2022.",
         "Before we turn to your questions, there was one person deserving of a special mention this quarter. Laura Clark will be leaving Regency for an exceptional opportunity within REIT Land and we could not be happier for her. Laura\u2019s contributions to Regency had been significant, as everyone on this call likely knows and while she will be missed, we are excited to watch your career continue to grow. Best of luck, Laura, and from your Regency team, thank you.",
         "With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hi. Good morning. Thank you. It looks like local tenants comprised 23% of your ABR but only about 16% of the deferrals that you\u2019ve agreed on. Can you sort of discuss your approach to dealing with those local tenants and attempting to collect rent, maybe specifically restaurants. There\u2019s been a lot of press reports about permanent restaurant closures. There\u2019s obviously a lot of concerns that non-payment of rent potentially turns into vacancy. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for your strategy to both collect that rent, but also mitigate that potential occupancy loss within your own portfolio?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Hey, Christy. This is Mike. Let me start with a little bit on our disclosure and then I\u2019m going to pass it on to Jim to more directly, I think, answer your question. We did highlight our local exposure and then we also highlighted our collection rates for local tenants both for the quarter, as well as in July one, and you see a decline in rate of collection there. I\u2019d like to note, however, that we have found that the local payers have been later than our national tenants.",
            "So measuring one month of local payment rates versus three months has been, I just want to make that distinction that, the local tenants have been paying a little bit later in this environment. In fact, if you were looking at our collection rates in July, at the same point in time as that of April, May and June by months, you\u2019ll see that that local collection rate is actually increased sequentially for all four months and we feel like that momentum is pretty positive and consistent with the other directional changes that we\u2019re seeing in our portfolio. With respect to the follow up, I\u2019ll let Jim give you some color."

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. Christy, what I\u2019d say is, we\u2019ve been very, very focused over the last eight years, 10 years, 12 years in our proactive asset management of merchandising and really enhancing the quality of our smaller shop tenants. So, as we look at that that group as a whole, that -- they\u2019re really good entrepreneurs, the business is their livelihood, so they\u2019re very invested. They\u2019ve got significant skin in the game and they\u2019re important players within the merchandising shopping center.",
            "So, by and large, they\u2019re nimble, they\u2019ve reacted well to the changing environment, our -- as I said in the opening remarks, I think, our teams are actively engaged in deferral plans to assist these folks get back on their feet. We\u2019re clearly going to have some fallout at the end of the day, but by and large, these retailers were doing well pre-pandemic and we want to do the best and everything we can do to help them survive and thrive post-pandemic."

         "Remarks": [
            "And if I may just quickly address the restaurant closures, I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any doubt that we\u2019re going to see a lot of failures in the restaurant category. But I think that the numbers that you see and the news reports that you\u2019re reading really are looking at America as a whole. And I like where we\u2019re positioned, close to the neighborhoods, close to people\u2019s homes.",
            "And also from an exposure standpoint, we have a lot less in sort of that fine dining, if you will, which I think is going to be probably the hardest tip. But as more people continue to work-from-home, and perhaps, moving forward as people continue to work-from-home even in a permanent state, I do believe that having those options for people close to their homes, the neighborhood community shopping center, we\u2019re still going to have restaurants as an important part of our merchandising mix that are -- at our really high quality portfolio going forward."

      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just thinking about the broader, including national and regional tenants, and, Jim, you mentioned in your comments in the opening remarks, being thoughtful about future performance and thinking about future performance and doing those deferral deals, have you done any rent abatements to-date? And in terms of that, looking at that unresolved bucket overall, what is your desire to keep pushing for deferral agreements, so pushing that deferral percentage higher here versus going down the road of litigation eventually?"

         "Speaker": "Christy McElroy"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Christy, that\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019d like to answer that by kind of opening up our playbook on the whole deferral process and our approach to it. As I said last quarter, we started out being patient deliberate. We didn\u2019t engage in the original on slot rent relief request back in March and April of that rather prestart tenants, we want them to get open and we\u2019ll address their needs when there\u2019s visibility.",
            "And now that we moved from 59% of our retailers open at the end of April to 95% today, I think, we\u2019re now in a more rational environment both tenant and landlord, we both have much better clarity and visibility as to needs. And we\u2019re finding good common ground for fair trade offs between a repayment plan and non-monetary concessions to create win-win for both of us.",
            "So as we kind of rewind early on in the process, we initially prioritized our top 300 tenants, which represents about 70% of our ABR and that was the first group we actively went out to work out agreements.",
            "But as of today, as we sit here, we\u2019re actively engaged with every one of our open retailers -- open and operating retailers, crafting modifications where needed and you can kind of see that priority strategy evidence in the 84% national and 16% local executed deferral agreements. So that mirrors exactly how we attacked the situation.",
            "Obviously, the categories that are hardest hit theaters, entertainment, fitness uses, full service restaurants, child related services. We continue to be very patient with this group, as these uses in general are still closed or operating under limited levels of occupancy.",
            "So, again, just to reiterate, we\u2019ve been very delivered in the papering process, as evidenced by the 4% executed deferral that you might see that stat in the investor slide deck that we sent. But the majority of uncollected rent is from tenants that we have ongoing relationship and dialogue with today, but have yet to pay for the agreements. We believe we will continue to close the gap on this uncollected bucket, but each deal is individually in nature and it will continue to take time to resolve."

            "I will add the -- I will add one thing, I think, it\u2019s important. Well, tracking these exact -- these deferral agreements is important. You really can\u2019t lose sight that our existing leases are binding contracts and the deferrals are just modifications outlining payback programs. The collectability of the outstanding receivable is really the key to the success and really coming out the other side of this pandemic the way we want to see it."

Should we expect the lag and occupancy declines as you possibly move tenants out, as it seems occupancy held up better than the NOI decline indicates? How should we think about that in our models?"

And there are going to be many that will fail and we know that. Even Laura\u2019s last day, she would be given me the eye that I\u2019m not allowed to provide any future NOI guidance, so I\u2019m going to refrain from that. But, absolutely, do expect that we are going to see occupancy declines and the NOI is reflecting, the reserves are reflecting some of that today."

And something a little more positive, feeling omnichannel now post-COVID is really emerging as the gold standard for navigating sales and wallet share for your tenants or retailers. How are you positioning Regency to capture the increasing demand trends of the omnichannel efforts and how are you facilitating bringing in tenants with the strategy and focus?"

What we like about our portfolio is the fact that we really have -- we are close to the neighborhoods. And we have a really high quality portfolio as most publicly and even -- and prior to institutionally owned shopping centers are, there are 30,000 to 40,000 shopping centers in the U.S. and we are going to continue to see store closures. We know that.",
            "But physical presence remains such a critical component in this omnichannel world, these retailers are going to keep those stores that are most productive, that have the highest quality, that can touch the most people and we\u2019re really well-positioned to take advantage of that.",
            "What this pandemic has done has really just accelerated that trend. To accelerate it for the retailers because they\u2019ve been forced to really innovate and move faster. And we\u2019re going to continue, Jim, even mentioned it in his prepared remarks, we\u2019re going to continue to do all that we can to facilitate for that retailer, so that we can partner with them and best enable them to satisfy their customers, which are our customers as well our shoppers."

            "Hi, Derek. This is Mac. We continue to evaluate these projects one at a time. Each one takes a lot of experience, a lot of discipline that we\u2019ve always shown. And when we start a project is based on a lot of factors, some of its pre-leasing, some of it\u2019s the format, some of it is the location, it\u2019s really a risk adjusted return at the end of the day. And so we\u2019re setting up projects that are ready to go and some that aren\u2019t ready to go, but we\u2019re continuing to advance entitlements to put ourselves in a position to start.",
            "So that when we have visibility to a green light position, we\u2019ll be in a position to start. So it\u2019s tough to tell you exactly when each project is going to start today, but we have lots of experience in this and we\u2019ll know on a case by case basis when to start projects. And I think we\u2019ll be able to also take advantage of a declining construction costs which will help our yield as well.",
            "And so we\u2019re setting ourselves up well, having this platform of offices throughout the country where we have local sharpshooters and local teams ready to go. I think really gives us a distinct advantage. So we\u2019re excited about that and the teams will be ready to start these projects when conditions present themselves."

Just -- I am going to follow-up on Mac\u2019s comments, because I think, it is a balance, as well as Mac and team are preparing at the property level and tenant demand, and in fact, will probably drive much of that decision making. We\u2019re also thinking about funding, right?",
            "So we need to align both the opportunity with the development, with the opportunity on the funding side. And as you know, prior to the pandemic, with free cash flow being our primary funding source of our development pipeline, that may change, but we have access to multiple sources of capital, whether that be property sales of lower growth assets or potentially even new capital in the form of debt or equity. We\u2019re preparing on that front as well."

So I guess the question really is, when I think about when we get to the end of 3Q and we\u2019re looking at I think your report your July uncollected at 21%. Are you going to have to go through sort of the same exercise to try to figure out what\u2019s uncollected and how much to reserve against it? And is there any reason to think that there\u2019s something about this mix that\u2019s either better or worse and it was in 2Q.

To the extent they move out, you won\u2019t have that debt expense, but you\u2019ll have no income. So the impact would be the same.",

Again, 40% of those did collect rent -- did pay rent in the second quarter that is 50% as of July, I think, that\u2019s a helpful statistic as well. Put in context of our opening percentages being materially higher than they were three months ago. At this point in time, that\u2019s about the best we can give from a forward looking perspective."

It\u2019s not a decision just to hold it, just to hold it.",

            "Owners of these properties, I think, really recognize the long-term value and they\u2019re not willing to sell them. There is really a scarcity of that product. But for those sellers that are willing to sell them, there is high demand for grocery-anchored neighborhood centers.",
            "The ones that are holding up the best are a little bit smaller because of just the amount of capital that\u2019s in the marketplace. But we\u2019re seeing cap rates really hold tight. They\u2019re really quite strong. There has been -- buyers are trying to figure out how best to underwrite forward cash flows. And they\u2019re cautiously underwriting limited growth for the next couple years and then in year three, typically, they\u2019re sort of back to historical norms.",
            "So we have some properties that we have put on the market and we\u2019re seeing a lot of demand. There is also demand for debt that\u2019s allowing people to execute, 50% to 60% permanent loans are available at tremendous rates, better than we\u2019ve seen a long, long time. So for our type of product, values are holding up really quite well. And I\u2019ll let Mike talk about how that relates to our NAV."

            "I\u2019ll actually jump. I\u2019ll give Mike a break. Since I keep tossing all of the reserve questions, too, I think, Mac said it well, and this is something that we\u2019ve been talking about quite a bit. There is still -- I think that, I said it in my prepared remarks as well, neighborhood community shopping centers and essential retail has never been more important than it is today. And I think that you\u2019re seeing that with how cap rates are responding.",
            "So they\u2019re have -- while there is not much change in the applied cap rate, what\u2019s really difficult to know is what is the NOI stream and also the cash stream even to recapture more NOI as we release. Because I do -- we do expect that there is going to be a significant amount of releasing that\u2019s going to happen in the future that\u2019s going to require TI spend.",
            "So from a valuation perspective, I mean, I can\u2019t -- we\u2019ve provided all of the information that we could provide. It really does come down to where does NOI settle and we\u2019re not -- we don\u2019t know that yet. It\u2019s still -- it\u2019s -- there\u2019s still too much uncertainty.",
            "So where does that new kind of base settle and then from there, I do expect that we\u2019ll have -- we will obviously have growth as it was pointed out earlier. We\u2019re starting at a lower base. We\u2019re going to continue to release and we\u2019ll see probably above average same property NOI growth in our portfolio for a period of time. But it will take capital to do that.",
            "So I know that I didn\u2019t exactly answer your questions Floris, but everyone\u2019s estimates are going to be different and we are -- we just need a little more clarity as to when this is really over and then we can start to recover from there."

The better operators were already focused on how can they best serve their customers in the most profitable manner. And they\u2019re -- while they\u2019re -- Kroger is focusing on the larger robotic automated warehouses partnerships with Walgreens. Ahold, I think, in Albertsons probably the most focused on the micro fulfilment centers.",

All of them are focused on how best to serve their customers in the most profitable way and there is still no argument that the most profitable way today, because that change in the future absolutely never say never.",
            "But today it\u2019s to bring the customer in the store. So they\u2019re still all very focused on serving their customer in an omnichannel fashion, but to the extent possible the most profitable way, which is in sending them to come into the store.",
            "With that said, again, you see that, you do see all the better operators are investing more in technology and spending more on the different means of that happening. And we continue to have the conversations. We continue to partner with them. We continue to help them where we can to facilitate that delivery of their goods. And I don\u2019t mean literally, I mean, within our shopping centers.",
            "It\u2019s going to continue to evolve. We\u2019re going to continue to see consolidation in the grocery. I think that scale matters. I think that having the cash flow and the money to invest and innovate and to invest in technology and invest in serving their customers, that\u2019s where the winners will be."

And typically, the more productive stores are going to be more profitable. So that certainly plays a role as when they\u2019re thinking about their network of stores and fulfilment centers. They are going to be very reluctant to close something that is profitable.",
            "They could use that store as the core or the center of a little of a smaller network if you will and add micro fulfilment around it to continue to service the customers even out of that particular store. So it absolutely is an input and a variable."

Now, as I stated earlier, we\u2019ve identified a collection of tenants that equates to about 20% of our rent roll is now on a cash basis.",

But as Jim kind of spend some time on earlier from a local tenant perspective, at least, it -- this is a storm for them that is pretty challenging. And that it\u2019s the severity of the circumstances, the inability to operate at all in some cases that has changed our perspective from a classification standpoint.",

Some of these -- lot of these local tenants are not built to pay a lump sum rents, right, just deferring it and paying it back in a year. And I would think maybe it\u2019s a little bit of a ball on shackle to some of these local tenants. How are you thinking about that and if deferrals even make sense to a lot of your tenant base?"

It\u2019s -- part of it is if there are 15-year operators always done exactly what they said and they\u2019re a great operator. I\u2019m going to bend over backwards and try to figure out how to make that tenant successful. We got a lot of tools in the toolkit. We\u2019ll employ them as we see fit.

But we\u2019ll continue to look at that. But these are good properties to have as well. I don\u2019t want to dismiss them.
