         "I would now like to turn the conference over to Steffen F\u00f8reid, CFO and CEO of H\u00f6egh Partners. Please go ahead."
      ],
      "Steffen F\u00f8reid": [
         "Thank you Keith, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to H\u00f6egh LNG Partners earnings call for the second quarter 2020. For your convenience, this webcast and presentation are available on our website.",
         "With me today I have Mr. Sveinung St\u00f8hle, the CEO and President of H\u00f6egh LNG and Mr. H\u00e5vard Furu, the CFO of H\u00f6egh LNG. The announced management transition for the partnership, Mr. St\u00f8hle and Mr. Furu will take over as the CEO and CFO of the partnership respectively with effect from tomorrow, August 21. ",
         "Turning to Page 2, in today\u2019s presentation I will take you through the quarter and then hand over to Mr. St\u00f8hle who will take you through the market section. After a summary at the end of the presentation, you will have the opportunity to ask questions to all three of us.",
         "Before we start, please take note of the forward-looking statements on Page 3 and a glossary on Page 4. ",
         "Turning to Page 5 and the highlights, I would like to start with some comments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of today, the partnership has not been materially impacted by the pandemic. The H\u00f6egh LNG Group has taken steps to mitigate risk from COVID-19 and ensure the health and safety of our crews and staff, which is our highest priority. This includes developing mitigating actions for crew rotation, and I\u2019m happy to say that safe crew rotation changes are now being done at acceptable frequency for both officers and ratings at all vessels. Thanks to the hard work of our people onboard the vessel and onshore, the fleet is operating as expected despite the pandemic. All charter parties remain in full force and effect and revenues are being collected in accordance with contractual terms. ",
         "I\u2019m therefore happy to report that all units in the fleet had 100% availability in the quarter. This resulted in total revenues of $34.4 million and a segment EBITDA of $36 million in the quarter. Based on a distribution of $0.44 per common unit, this resulted in a solid coverage ratio of 1.24 in the quarter.",
         "Turning to Page 6, we are putting more numbers to the quarter, which shows an improved operating performance compared to the same quarter last year. The segment EBITDA of $36 million in the quarter is up from $31 million in the same quarter last year. The improvement is explained by higher time charter revenue and lower operating expenses in the quarter, mainly due to the schedule of hire for H\u00f6egh Gallant and maintenance expenses relating to H\u00f6egh Gallant and PGN FSRU Lampung in the second quarter last year. The improved operating result led to a distributable cash flow of $18.7 million and, as already mentioned, a strong coverage ratio in the quarter.",
         "Again, I would like to thank all of our seafarers and onshore staff enabling the partnership to deliver stable operations during these unprecedented times. ",
         "Turning to Page 7, we are showing the development in key metrics over time, and as you can see from the graphs, the consistency in operating performance stands out. The only exception is the second quarter last year, which was impacted by the scheduled dry docking and maintenance of H\u00f6egh Gallant. H\u00f6egh Grace is the next vessel due for periodic survey, expected to take place late 2020, early 2021; however, this will be carried out afloat and is not expected to cause significant downtime or off-hire. ",
         "I would further like to highlight the stability in distributions from the partnership through the pandemic, and with the signing of the five-year subsequent charter relating to H\u00f6egh Gallant during the quarter, the average remaining contract length stands at approximately 9.2 years at the end of the quarter, underpinning the stability in cash flows.",
         "Turning to Page 8, we are showing the income statement in more detail. Total revenues of $34.4 million in the quarter is up from the same period last year, mainly due to 100% availability of all assets in the quarter compared to 60 days of hire for H\u00f6egh Gallant in the second quarter last year. The increase is partly offset by lower revenues relating to reimbursable costs in the quarter.",
         "Vessel operating expenses of $5.7 million in the quarter is down from the same period last year mainly due to engine maintenance expenses on H\u00f6egh Gallant and PGN FSRU Lampung in the second quarter last year. ",
         "Equity in earnings of joint ventures in the quarter compares to equity losses of joint ventures in the same quarter last year; however, excluding unrealized losses on derivative instruments, equity in earnings of joint ventures would have been $4.2 million in the quarter compared to $3.1 million for the same quarter last year. The increase is mainly due to higher revenues related to reimbursable costs partly offset by higher maintenance expense in the quarter. ",
         "Total financial expense of $6.6 million in the quarter is down from the same quarter last year mainly due to lower interest expense as debt is amortized and a foreign exchange gain in the quarter. ",
         "Turning to Page 9, the balance sheet has not changed much since year end 2019, with total liabilities and equities standing at just below $1 billion at the end of the quarter. One thing worth mentioning is that in addition to the $25 million of cash on the balance sheet, the partnership had approximately $88 million in undrawn amounts under the two revolving credit facilities at the end of the quarter, taking the total liquidity to approximately $114 million. ",
         "Turning to Page 10, we are showing the overview of the partnership\u2019s fleet of modern assets, and as already mentioned, the main focus during the quarter and across the fleet has been to develop and implement COVID-19 risk mitigating measures and ensure safe crew changes at acceptable intervals. In regards to H\u00f6egh Gallant, the subsequent charter is now in force with a term running through July 2025. The charter became effective May 1 this year and is contributing with two months of earnings in this quarter\u2019s results. The vessel is operating in LNG carrier mode under a seven-month charter while offered for long term FSRU employment on several potential projects.",
         "Regarding our parent, H\u00f6egh LNG Holdings, all vessels in our fleet are on contract and business development activities are high, and as we will touch upon in the next section, the parent is in advanced stages of negotiations on several potential projects with a scheduled investment decision this year. If everything goes according to plan, this should lead to growth opportunities for the partnership over the next year or so.",
         "With that, I would like to hand the word over to Mr. St\u00f8hle, who will take us through the market section of the presentation.",
         "Thank you Sveinung. I would like to turn to Page 16 for a summary, where I would like to highlight the following. First of all, the partnership has not been materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to date. During the quarter there was 100% availability of the fleet, resulting in stable operating performance and a solid coverage ratio in the quarter. The market fundamentals are strong and the partnership is enjoying strong support from its parent, which is a market leader in the FSRU segment. ",
         "With this, that completes the presentation and we would now like to open up for questions from the audience. "
      ],
      "Sveinung St\u00f8hle": [
         "Thank you very much Steffen, and good morning everybody. My name is Sveinung St\u00f8hle, for those of you that have not met me, and I very much look forward to taking over together with Mr. Furu, the CEO and CFO positions respectively going forward.",
         "First on the market section, Slide No. 12, you will see an overview of the pipeline of FSRU projects that the parent is currently involved in. Actually, please note that this is not an exhaustive list but it\u2019s a list of the, call it closest in time type projects that we are currently have under development.",
         "As you will see, we have split the list of the projects into three categories: from the left, where we are already selected as the FSRU provider, in the middle the ongoing tenders, and then on the right bilateral projects, meaning that we are in direct negotiations with the client. To note on this projects, all of them have start-up dates from 2021 to 2023, most of them in 2022. On the left side, the two projects in Australia are probably the ones which are the most advanced where we basically are waiting for the final investment decision over the next few months, and that could also be the case for at least a couple of the ongoing tenders, especially in the Philippines and in South America.",
         "Overall, we have at the moment five FSRUs for which we are seeking long term charters. Two of these we have already allocated to the two Australian projects - that\u2019s the Esperanza and the Galleon, and that leaves three FSRUs to be covered with the remaining seven projects that we have on this list. That means that we are very comfortable with securing these contracts, and all of these contracts except one will be eligible for a potential drop down to the partnership given that they all have contracts which are more than five years, actually most of them were 10 years, so a healthy project pipeline which would and will underpin further growth.",
         "Turning then to Page 13, a view of how the market looks. Looking at the graph on the left, it shows the global monthly LNG trade, so in the first half of this year actually the LNG demand is up 6.5%, and if you look at the curve on the top, meaning the curve for 2020, you will see that the curve actually turned in July and then turned upwards again, and [indiscernible] so this shows again the very strong resilience of the LNG market. As listed here, in particular for example in China, the imports bounced back in the second quarter and increased with 20% year-on-year. I think this is a remarkable achievement and shows that the LNG asset commodity is holding up extremely well compared to any of the other energy markets.",
         "Moving to Slide No. 14 and a view of a bit longer term on the expected demand for LNG, again this is a forecast from IHS, and you see that compared to the estimate that IHS had at the start of the year, the demand curve has moved to the right but nevertheless still growth in 2020, and then a strong pick-up in demand as from 2021, leading to a total demand estimated for 2024 of around 430 million tons per annum, and that\u2019s up from roughly 365 in 2020, meaning an average growth of some 4% plus per year over the period. This demand is led by China and the emerging markets in South and Southeast Asia. ",
         "What\u2019s driving this growth? In addition to the general energy transition away from coal and oil, if we then move to the next slide, Slide 15, which shows you how prices have developed comparing liquids and LNG and including coal, it\u2019s clear that today LNG, spot LNG is actually cheaper than coal. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever happened before, and that has a very strong effect on demand. Obviously the price of LNG will move up and down going forward, but there is a split in the market and it\u2019s obvious that the drive away from the particular coal but also oil products and the availability of LNG in the market going forward will mean that LNG prices will stay very competitive in the time to come and that definitely bodes very well for more demand for LNG, and obviously then there will be the need for additional input facilities in the form of FSRUs, which is what we provide.",
         "To complete on the market section on Slide No. 16 is the overview of the total fleet and the order book. As you can see, the order book is actually very stable and the number of companies operating in the FSRU segment is also very stable. There has been two deliveries in the quarter, two new builds, one for Swan Energy which is for a project in India, and one to [indiscernible] which has chartered that FSRU to accelerate. That leaves a total fleet of 37 on the water. There are four new bid FSRUs on order, of which two are in contract already, and there are four conversions of which all are on contract. ",
         "There are no new orders that have been made for FSRUs. I think it\u2019s a very manageable order book, but obviously there are FSRUs available and that means that from a market point of view, the competition between the companies you see here will continue. But we do believe that we have the assets that makes us very competitive in this market and in particular for the projects that we showed previously.",
         "That completes the market overview, so I hand back to you, Steffen."

I believe on the last call, you guys said that you could expect to see a drop-down coming your way in 2022, and I just wanted to understand if that\u2019s still your expectation given the ongoing tenders that you guys described.

            "Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say that some of the projects have seen slow progress over the last quarter, others on the other hand are very much following their original timeline and actually some were actually moving quicker, in order to take advantage of the low price. It really depends on where it is and to a large extent it has to do with how the area or the country has been affected with lockdowns and what have you, but I do expect that these things will bounce back and we are finding ways to basically continue development even with the difficulties in logistics and the inability to have physical meetings."

         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. Just a final quick question about the availability of financing for these drop-downs. I know you guys have also discussed in the last call about financing availability for the drop-downs and what the availability is there, but I was just wondering if you could provide some commentary on that as well and also in the context of your deleveraging progress, because I believe before you had mentioned that you\u2019ve been targeting roughly on the next year to deleverage on a debt to EBITDA basis by about half a turn, so just wondering how your expectations--you know, how the financing availability has changed and how your expectations of deleveraging have been impacted, if at all."

         "Speaker": "LiamGarrity-Rokous"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, so in that respect, the parent has financed the drop-down candidate with bank debt at the parent level, and this bank debt will follow the asset when dropped down to the partnership, so what the partnership has to finance is the equity portion of this transaction since the bank debt follows. What\u2019s available to us is we have the common units, we have the preferred units potentially we could also increase leverage slightly, but I think if you look at the pref market, the prefs have upheld quite well through the turbulence. Obviously we will need to see an uplift in the common units for that cost of capital to facilitate an acquisition, but I think once we are in a position to negotiate an acquisition, we will have to look at the sources available to us at that point in time.",
            "At the same time, we are deleveraging and at least on a net debt to EBITDA basis, we see that the ratio is going down, and I think for this quarter it was below 4."

Maybe just a question for you, Mr. St\u00f8hle, and congrats for taking the new position as CEO, but where would you like to focus your time and energy, maybe in the first six months coming into this position, maybe some color on the strategic direction you\u2019d like to take the partnership in and where you\u2019d focus your time and energy would be helpful."

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Well, obviously as you know, looking at the assets in the partnership and the contract coverage, it\u2019s very much a stable and transparent business, and I think the direction is very clear. Number one, we will continue with the strategy that has been in place with stable dividends and continued very good performance. In addition to that, of course as has been discussed, securing additional growth will be on the agenda, but obviously that will need to come in place when there are available drop-down candidates from the parent, which I would say looking at it from my side, the prospects for that looks very good. ",
            "Then we do have on the agenda to basically improve on the financial structure, make that more efficient going forward. But in the short term, I think the company has been very well run by Steffen and taking over, I think this will be mostly focused on continuing on the good path that we are on and then taking one step at a time."

            "That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s really helpful. You made an interesting comment on the market competition for FSRUs, so maybe could you provide a little bit more color on that and where you see that coming from, and whether you see that competition really significantly different from, let\u2019s just say a year ago or even six months back."

         "Remarks": [
            "Well in actual fact, there isn\u2019t very much change if you look at the structure of the market, that there are four main players. It\u2019s us, Excelerate, Golar, and BW, and then potentially one more coming from Dynagas when they will have their FSRUs delivered a year and a half from now. The other FSRUs in the market, most of them have been ordered directly for a specific project, so they are not really in competition, but obviously you only need one competitor to make a competition, so clearly the competition is still there. ",
            "But if you take each of them, clearly I think Golar hasn\u2019t shown very much interest to add to their fleet, and I doubt very much that that will happen. As for Excelerate, they have a relatively aging fleet with smaller capacities on their vessels, but obviously they are a fleet which is very well run and operates well, and then BW, now that fleet is up to four, so I understand that they are still interested to keep growing in this market, which leaves us with at least three or four competitors. At the same time, we have a larger fleet, we have operations which show that we can operate in any market in any geography, which we have done, so I think that going forward the competitive environment in this market will continue to be the same as it has been. I don\u2019t really see newcomers coming in, at least certainly not in the new bid market. There are some conversions that are being done for specific projects, but clearly our focus is very simple at the parent level and that is to secure the long term contracts that we are working on, as explained, for the four or five units that we have available, and then clearly we will be back in expansion mode after that. But all the contracts will have to be in place before any new orders are made by our company."

I know you mentioned in the outlook statement the general risk of counterparties delivering here and the credit risk associated with these counterparties. Can you maybe talk to--I know you guys haven\u2019t been affected by COVID as much, but is that comment purely related to COVID or is that another structural change in the market here in terms of the credit risk of counterparties, or is that just purely COVID related?"

We are collecting revenue according to contract and our counterparties are paying according to contract, so we have not seen anything there, but I think it\u2019s prudent to expand on that risk section given the uncertainty following the COVID-19 pandemic.

It\u2019s netting out the costs that we have, so when we perform work for our charter and we incur costs, we get them reimbursed, and this quarter was a bit--you know, it has accumulated a bit costs that we got reimbursed from previous periods."

I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the results for the parent that we announced this morning, but obviously we have a major cost saving plan in place that we implemented earlier this year, and one of the factors there is definitely to reduce SG&A. I think that goes across the group, so the answer to your question is we clearly expect that we will be able to reduce administrative costs fairly significantly as compared to the previous quarters going forward. I would say likely also the same for operating costs, but that will take a little bit longer time to show up."

It\u2019s a big spec to take - you know, it costs anywhere from $60 million to $100 million on top of [indiscernible] which you most likely cannot trade afterwards, so I think for people to take that risk, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very likely."

Obviously there has been orders made previously on a speculative basis, but we haven\u2019t--the last one was made two years ago, so I doubt very much that we will see any major numbers in that respect, simply because people have understood that this market is not a shipping market and it takes time to get the experience and win the contracts, and therefore I think pure speculative orders, if any, will be very far in between.
