         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you. My first question was about the spin-off, any update of the spin-off of the core business? And then my second question is was management\u2019s observation of the recent trend in the budget allocation of property developers between various channels, including the marketing channels, these channels, e-commerce coupon channel and also the brokerage distribution channel and what\u2019s the outlook for the second half? Thank you."

      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So, I will translate the response. Based on our understanding, developers usually will balance their promotional channels in their budget as a whole. The cost of distribution channels is relatively high and they usually will control their budget in this area. In terms of advertising, it is a long-term promotional tool and they do place emphasis in a higher budget on advertising in their budget as a form of promotion. In terms of leads, which is a service we began 2 years ago and it is product that you can see \u2013 where you can see your potential clients relatively directly. And it is a popular product with developers and you can see from our growth in revenue in our financial statements. And in terms of e-commerce coupons, we see that today they are not used as widely in the market. So their numbers are actually lower. Thank you.",
            "Okay. So, Miranda I will translate your question. And if there is anything that needs to be added let me know. So the question was regarding whether in the budget for developers, the amount allotted for distribution channels should be relatively constant as a percentage. And whether the budget for online distributions and advertising is awfully fixed percentage and whether there may be some cannibalization between listings and leaks business, which explains the difference between OSHA explains the difference in lower listings revenue versus higher leads generation revenue. The response was that the developers have a total budget for their marketing efforts on this could vary based on their cost basis for different projects as well as different forms of marketing.",
            "In terms of channel distributions this percentage in the budget could depend on the project as some products sell well in certain cities, which means that they could have a lower percentage of the budget and in terms of leads and listings, having potential cannibalization. Both are combined is not does not make up for the highest costs for developers in marketing on the highest usually being their direct marking centers at the project locations themselves and we see a very fast growth in leads generation, because it\u2019s relatively new comparatively speaking, it\u2019s only been in existence as a service for 2 years, excuse me. And the leads are and listings are usually supporting products that support each other instead of substitutes. We see that in our client base, most developers will place orders for both products. And in terms of effect, advertising and listing helps with their brand and project recognition and it leads to new leads. So we see them as working together on behalf of our clients. And we also see that in the future, there is room for growth to increase the budget in this area in both advertising listing and leads generation combined. Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you. So my last question is about our leads generation services. So, first of all, if we look at the sales cost for the company actually declined year-over-year and we also tracked third-party data shows seem to suggest a material increase in the company\u2019s overall traffic. However, our leads generation services revenue increased a lot in the quarter, which we seem to conclude that\u2019s because the fees volume has been increasing materially, which is that a result of the increasing traffic to these conversion rates, because given that traffic seems may not be increasing materially while this volume increase a lot. So if that\u2019s the case that our traffic to leads conversion has increased materially, then my question is what kind of initiatives has the company taken to increase this conversion? Thank you."

      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So I will briefly translate the response. So, basically the development of leads generation similar to how initially online websites, were developed, where users will log on to website and leaves without necessarily the websites using their information that they left behind. In terms of our lead generation, we have made our content better in terms of meeting the specific demands of end users, whether that is in the form of IM messaging, calling for information, or signing up for real estate events. This combined makes our platform more efficient, more user-friendly and more useful for our end users. And this makes our products more efficient in terms of an increase in the targeted leads and an increase in \u2013 leading to an increase in leads generation revenue without an increase necessarily in traffic. So, our product has seen improved technology in terms of more defined user profiles and information that our developer clients find very useful. Thank you."

This is a one-time occurrence and will be seen only in this quarter only. The income tax benefits, is from the past tax withholdings in the past year that has been allocated to this quarter.
