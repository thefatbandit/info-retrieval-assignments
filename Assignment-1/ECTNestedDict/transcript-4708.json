      "Clive Newall": [
         "Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Joining me on the call today are Philip Pascall, Chairman and CEO; Hannes Meyer, CFO; Tristan Pascall, Director, Strategy; Juliet Wall, General Manager, Finance; and Simon MacLean, Group Reporting Controller; and Rudi Badenhorst, Director of Operations, Zambia.",
         "As usual, before we proceed, I will draw your attention to the fact that over the course of this conference call, we'll be making several forward-looking statements. And as such, I encourage you to read the cautionary note that accompanies our second quarter MD&A and the related results' news release as well as the risk factors particular to our company, which are detailed in our most recent annual information form and available on our website on SEDAR. A reminder that the presentation which accompanies this conference call is available on our website.",
         "So as usual, I'll get us started with some opening remarks, then Tristan will provide an update on Cobre Panama before Hannes' review of the financial results. We will then open the lines to take your questions.",
         "Again, there continues to be very little as usual these days as the pandemic continues. We have seen some easing of restrictions related to COVID in a few jurisdictions, but in others, new or tougher restrictions are being put in place. For this call, this is now the second time that the majority of the participants are dialing in from home, but we are hopeful that over the next few weeks, some kind of normalcy will resume as more offices open.",
         "At the start of the quarter, globally, governments were beginning to deal with COVID-19 as its serious impacts were being better understood. Similarly, we have put in place various protocols and measures to protect our employees and communities, but otherwise, our operations continue to operate fairly normally.",
         "In early April, as you know, a suspension of labor in Panama resulted in Cobre Panama being placed on preservation and safe maintenance, which impacted production significantly. However, as recently announced in early July, we were given the go-ahead to resume operations. And we are now back on track to deliver our revised production expectations. Tristan will provide more detail on the activity at Cobre Panama in the quarter and what the plan for resumption and ramp-up entails.",
         "Despite the suspension of Cobre Panama, the quarter was really solid, both operation and financially. We delivered a significant improvement in costs and production consistent with the revised guidance. Our C1 costs were at the low end of the guidance range, and our all-in sustaining costs were better than guidance. Kansanshi was steady with improved throughput and recoveries on both mixed and sulfide ore circuits.",
         "Sentinel was the star of the quarter. Production was at its highest levels since 2018, and costs were at a record low as a result of increased throughput, lower fuel prices and currency depreciation.",
         "In May, Ravensthorpe shipped its first nickel as restart and ramp up to full production continues. We had an additional nickel shipment in June, and deliveries are expected to continue monthly for the rest of the year.",
         "Although the impact of the pandemic at our operations has been manageable so far and has had a relatively modest impact operationally, I do need to acknowledge the impact the pandemic has had on our workforce, many of whom have been unable to return to their families and homes for extended periods as a result of quarantine requirements, rotation, timings and travel restrictions. On behalf of the entire company, I'd like to thank our people who have made these personal sacrifices, and we recognize the significant contribution they continue to make to the success of the business.",
         "I would also like to express our sincere condolences to the families and colleagues of the 5 members of our workforce in Panama that perished as a result of COVID-19. The company continues to place top priority on health and safety throughout our operations, and this will continue in future as we focus on measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 amongst our workforce and communities.",
         "Now I'd like to turn things over to Tristan to provide an update on Cobre Panama. As most of you know, Tristan was GM at Cobre Panama through the construction phase until being pointed -- appointed Director, Strategy earlier this year. However, he has continued to provide oversight as the operation navigates the current unique environment.",
         "So over to you, Tristan.",
         "Thanks, Hannes. So operator, can you please open the lines to take questions?"
      ],
      "Hannes Meyer": [
         "Thanks, Tristan, and good day to everyone.",
         "I'd like to take you to Slide 8. And there's a presentation available on our website if you want to follow that in the presentation and it's called Overview.",
         "In summary, total copper production was in line with the same quarter in 2019. And total unit cost C1 and all-in sustaining costs achieved their lowest level in 3 years. Sentinel performed exceptionally in this quarter with the highest production since the fourth quarter of 2018 with record low unit costs.",
         "There were robust performances at both Kansanshi and Guelb Moghrein, with both operations achieving a reduction in unit costs and consistent levels of production. Guelb Moghrein's C1 was the lowest in over a decade and the lowest reported all-in sustaining cost. Production benefited from Las Cruces operating at normal throughput levels compared to the impact of the land slippage last year. As Tristan highlighted, there was reduced production at Cobre Panama as it operated under preservation and safe maintenance mode.",
         "Copper prices were relatively low for much of the quarter, but have trended upwards from the end of June into July. As a result of the recent increased prices and given uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19, the company has taken the opportunity to extend its copper sales hedge program out to December 21 to mitigate any future price risk. I will talk to this as well as our nickel hedge program in more detail later in the presentation.",
         "The company has also hedged 151 million liters of ultra-low sulfur diesel as part of our cost management strategy. Ravensthorpe completed the commissioning of 2 high-pressure acid leach circuits in April and May, respectively, with the first shipment of nickel occurring in the quarter. Production is expected to continue to ramp up throughout the third quarter.",
         "Turning to Slide 9 on production. Total production for the quarter of 169,000 tons was slightly higher than Q2 2019. Sentinel's performance was particularly pleasing with higher throughput driving production to one of its highest quarterly levels, 11% higher than the same quarter in 2019.",
         "Kansanshi delivered another robust performance with higher throughput and recoveries, ensuring overall production was in line with the same quarter of 2019. Las Cruces operated at normal throughput levels compared to the same quarter in 2019, which was impacted by the land slippage. Cobre Panama production was lower than planned as a result of preservation and maintenance mode operation. Gold production of 55,000 ounces was lower than the same quarter of 2019, reflecting preservation and safe maintenance at Cobre Panama and planned maintenance at Kansanshi.",
         "Turning to the next slide, financial overview. Comparative EBITDA of $352 million in the quarter benefited from favorable movement in the hedge program and foreign exchange as well as lower costs. There were gains -- these gains were offset by 12% lower market copper price as well as cost in ramping up production at Ravensthorpe. There was a comparative loss of $84 million in the quarter and a comparative loss of $0.12 per share. And net finance expense of $186 million has been recognized, of which a significant portion which previously been eligible for capitalization in the same period of 2019, but it's now expensed following the declaration of commercial production at Cobre Panama.",
         "Net debt was marginally higher than the previous quarter, impacted by timing of service, preservation and safe maintenance period at Panama and ramp-up costs at Ravensthorpe. In addition, the phasing of tax payments was relatively high in this quarter.",
         "And then going to Slide 11, which has got the exchanges and comparative EBITDA just depicting that and showing the impact of the metal prices -- production, but also offset by benefits on the hedging and the ramp-up cost of Ravensthorpe.",
         "Going to the next slide, Slide 12. Copper unit cash costs, both C1 and all-in sustaining costs for the quarter, were at their lowest level for 3 years. Copper all-in sustaining cost of $1.62 per pound and C1 cash cost was $1.20 per pound for the second quarter of 2020. The $0.15 per pound and $0.12 per pound decreased, respectively, compared to the same period of 2019.",
         "Lower C1 cash costs reflects, in particular, decreases at Zambia operations due to lower fuel cost, favorable ForEx, lower maintenance at Kansanshi and increased production at Sentinel. Sentinel achieved a record low C1 cash cost of $1.36 per pound. Lower C1 cash costs for over a decade at Guelb Moghrein with lower mining, fuel cost and higher realized gold prices and the lowest reported all-in sustaining costs. C1 cash costs include contribution from Cobre Panama of $1.72 per pound, which is higher than planned as it was operating under preservation and maintenance. Lower all-in sustaining cost reflects lower C1 cost combined with lower royalties.",
         "Turning to the next slide, copper hedging program outlook. Copper hedge program has been extended to December '21 to ensure stability of cash flows while maintaining compliance with financial covenants and with the fluctuations in commodity prices.",
         "The bar chart represents -- presented here shows the split between swaps and collars at 29th July. The company has unmargined copper forward sale contracts a little bit more than 210,000 tons at an average price of $2.71 per pound outstanding with maturities to December '21. In addition, the company has unmargined 0 cost sales contracts for just a bit more than 200,000 tons at a weighted average price of $2.70 pound -- per pound at the bottom to $2.94 outstanding with maturities to July '21.",
         "Approximately half of the expected copper sales in the next 12 months are hedged at an average oil price of $2.70 per pound. The company also has just under 8,000 tons of unmargined nickel forward sales contract at an average price of $6.76 per pound with maturities to February '21.",
         "Turning to the next slide on debt and liquidity profile. The company ended the quarter with $882 million of net unrestricted cash and cash equivalent and was in full compliance with all its financial covenants. Taking into account forecasted operating cash inflows, capital expenditure outflows and available cash and committed facilities, the company expects to have sufficient liquidity through the next 12 months to carry out its operating capital expenditure plans and remain in full compliance with its financial covenants. We continue to take action to manage operational prices and also to further strengthen the balance sheet.",
         "Turning to the next slide on 2020 guidance. As noted by Tristan, Cobre Panama copper and gold guidance have been reduced following its preservation and maintenance period operation. Production guidance for all other copper operations remain unchanged. Total copper production guidance is now 725,000 to 770,000 tons compared to 755,000 to 805,000 tons guidance previously issued. Total guidance has been -- gold guidance has been reduced to 230,000 to 250,000 ounces, a 20,000-ounce decrease from previous guidance.",
         "Nickel production guidance at Ravensthorpe has been narrowed to 15,000 to 17,000 tons. Cash cost guidance has remained unchanged and is not being reduced as COVID-19 does pose some additional risk. However, we have been operating over the past quarter at the lower end of the C1 guidance and slightly below guidance for all-in sustaining costs. Total capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged, but with a change in allocation to reflect essential sustaining expenditure and phasing of expenditure as well as reduced capitalized stripping at Cobre Panama. Full year depreciation expense guidance has been reduced by $50 million to reflect reduced Cobre Panama production.",
         "Thank you. And I will now hand back over to Clive."

      "Operator": [
         "Good morning. My name is Cindy, and I will be your conference operator today.",
         "At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quantum Minerals second quarter earnings results conference call. [Operator Instructions]",
         "Mr. Clive Newall, President and Director of First Quantum Minerals, you may begin your conference."
      ],
      "Tristan Pascall": [
         "Thanks, Clive, and thank you to everyone who's joining the call.",
         "Certainly, the second quarter at Cobre Panama was a challenging period, but there were some strong successes along the way, and we're confident in the ramp-up for the remainder of the year. As Clive mentioned, at the beginning of the quarter, during the first week of April, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Panama ordered the temporary suspension of labor activities on site in -- to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "I'll emphasize that First Quantum acted early in response to the pandemic. When COVID-19 was declared an international public health emergency, the company moved quickly to introduce health and sanitation protocols across all of its sites. By the beginning of April at Cobre Panama, we had already implemented health and sanitation protocols and reduced the personnel on site down to around 2,800. In response to the Ministry of Health Resolution, the company placed Cobra Panama on preservation and safe maintenance beginning on the 7th of April in order to ensure the safety and the protection of personnel, the environment and also the assets. And personnel levels were reduced down to about 800.",
         "Clive mentioned the tragedy -- the tragic loss of 5 members of our colleagues from Cobre Panama who succumbed to symptoms associated with COVID-19 in April and May. We extend our deepest condolences to their families. And we'd also like to thank the medical staff from the Ministry of Health who treated our people in hospital and those who continue to work on resolving the wider pandemic in the country.",
         "We've been working with governments on their response to the wider pandemic, and this has included donations of medical equipment, including PPE, testing kits and ICU equipment. And we've been helping to support families in need with food and supplies in our surrounding communities. We've always been committed to giving back to our communities around the mine and providing help and support when we can.",
         "In order to sanitize the mine, Cobre Panama implemented a deep disinfection program. We've been working closely with our unions, our suppliers and the local community in this. For example, the local women's cooperative have been producing many of the face masks for the site. And we set a very high standard for COVID-19 protocols on the site. It's a testament to the hard work of each and every employee on the site that we are able to successfully implement these standards. Many of our people work extended rotations throughout the quarter away from their families, and we thank them for their commitment and support.",
         "The temporary suspension orders from the Ministry of Health were lifted on 3rd of July, and we announced shortly thereafter the resumption of normal operations. We've implemented already a reopening plan, under which we expect operations to ramp up to full production by mid-August.",
         "The priority for Cobre Panama continues to be health and safety of the workforce and surrounding communities, and the strict protocols and sanitary vigilance remain in place as the new normal way of working. The reopening plan provides for the safe and sanitary increase in personnel on site for around 800 that were on site during preservation and safe maintenance. At the end of last week, there were around 1,450 personnel on site, and we expect to be at around 1,850 personnel by the end of this week with another 600 personnel already in preemptive quarantine. Each movement of personnel currently involves 14 days of preemptive quarantine with testing at front and back to ensure no contagion. We are able to run at full production with around 2,200 frontline personnel, but we're aiming for a sustainable full complement of around 3,400 to be brought back to site in a phased manner and in line with the health protocols.",
         "Only essential frontline personnel are on the priority list to return to site, and our support areas are working remotely off-site. We are also adapting to push new ways of working in the case of travel restrictions, such as remote and virtual maintenance support, so we can utilize our personnels' expertise from their home countries.",
         "In terms of production, during Q2, we did run at a reduced level of operations really in order to keep vital equipment warm and dry and free from condensation in the Panama climate and to ensure good environmental standing. We were cycling through each mill train running one at a time. And as a result, we produced around 21,000 tons of copper and 7,800 ounce of gold in the quarter. Recoveries were slightly impacted by the increased proportion of surface stockpiles we processed under the restricted operations, but we do expect recoveries to return to normal levels for the rest of the year.",
         "The cash cost of production in Q2 reflect the lower production level and included with the C1 and all-in sustaining costs is $4 million associated with health and safety protocols. A further $6 million in costs associated with placing the operation in preservation and safe maintenance were incurred in April but excluded from cash costs. For the rest of the year, unit costs will reduce as a result of the higher production volumes. But we do expect some ongoing higher health and safety costs.",
         "In terms of guidance, we've taken a cautious approach. We recognize there are some risks out of our direct control, which may yet emerge as a result of the pandemic. So production at Cobre Panama for the full year 2020 is now expected to be between 180,000 and 200,000 tons of copper and between 70,000 and 80,000 ounces of gold. We currently have 1 train running at near capacity and will bring up the remaining 2 trains over the next few weeks. We do have some catch-up on prevention and maintenance but stand very confident for the operation to be fully ramped up by mid-August.",
         "Our expectations for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021 are that we can ramp up to the 85 million ton annualized throughput with confidence. We're actively working on mine plans for the expansion to 100 million tons per annum at present and remain on track with the timetable on the 43-101 for this expansion.",
         "With that, I'll now ask Hannes to take you through the finance presentation. Thanks, Hannes."

            "Orest, yes. So as I said, we can run all 3 trains with about 2,200 people. But that's really the frontline guys driving trucks, the operators on the process plant. We'd like to get at a sustainable the full level of about 3,400 people on site, and we'll phase that up. So mid-August, we're comfortable in that. On a sustainable basis, we'd like to have that 3,400 people, and that would underline that capability. And that will come from mid-August. I think it will just get more and more reliable across the year.",
            "So Q3 will still be in a ramp-up because of the workover, July, August and then into September. And I think you'll see Q4 at a fairly steady level or going well."

            "And look, we tend to be opportunistic in that. So if the market is there, we'll extend those maturities and go back and issue new bonds and extend that. But it's a matter of market conditions determining that."

So we'll see a continuous benefit on dollars exchange rate. Where the oil price is, most of the agents, they are oil price-based. And we've renegotiated fuel contracts and ensure that we have excellent diesel fuel costs for the remainder of this year going into next year. So I think Sentinel is set to continue to impress throughout this year."

So at Cobra Panama, I think the one area where CapEx -- where the main component of CapEx looking forward is the 100 million tonne per annum expansion. And we had envisaged some capital in the second half of the year, and we'd still like to make progress on that. We'll see how that goes in terms of permitting, ready to start that work. And that's probably the major one from Cobre Panama. The sustaining capital and so on that you see for the businesses in the tailings, and that needs to happen in order. What we've done there is shift the schedule a little bit, but that capital would be required nonetheless. So it's just a scheduling element there.",
            "Elsewhere at Cobre Panama, the capital has been saved really on component change-outs because we haven't been burning machine hours, for example, on the large rope shovels. Those really are very chunky capital commitments to do the undercarriage change on the P&H shovel. And so when we're not burning the machine hours, we're able to push that out. But the depreciation of that reflects elsewhere in the business.",

And in terms of Cobre Panama, we're comfortable with the level that we're spending in the mine in order to keep the production profile correct for next year. The work that needs to go in and the work where we're putting it in is, can we make the mine run at an optimum level of 100 million tons per annum.

The oil price was $24 a barrel, which, of course, it's moved from -- you don't get it for $24 a barrel because it's in contango as the years go up. But that already looks like it was for virtually every month going forward, we would look pretty good and therefore, we can retain low operating costs.

I can paint a scenario for you where we ramp up very -- in a very orderly fashion. But right now, the virus in Panama, it looks like it spiked and reached its maximum, but that would be very early to say that with -- in a definitive fashion. So we're just aware that there's a large body of contagion in the country, and so we need to be checking people very carefully as they come through. And potentially, if you had a group come through and there was co-transmission, then we would need -- we would delay that group of people coming in. So it's that kind of thing that would knock you back. But otherwise, yes, in an orderly -- in terms of -- everything ran like clockwork, then I think yes, we would definitely be pushing those numbers."

Just trying to figure out, thinking about the guidance for next year, how much of that reiteration of the 2021 CapEx guidance reflects the FX gains, particularly in Zambia? Because just reading through the script, it looks like you have pushed out some of the 2020 CapEx items into next year. So I'm trying to figure out how much offset you get through either FX or just overall like CapEx savings."

There's some rollovers that I don't want to comment in detail on next year's CapEx, but we should be ballpark the same sort of number. But I don't want to -- it's a detailed exercise that we go through end of the year, evaluate the new plans. I think it's probably safe to stick with sort of similar numbers for now."

And it'll probably give an alternative too because there are some slightly different routes that I'm going to take.

And what I mean by that is, of course, for the next couple of years, our main aim -- and in your discussions, you've just been having with Hannes has to do with debt reduction and the like.

But taxes, if you look at the history, it's had a history of changing quite rapidly. I think most recently, it's been in a better frame of mind over the last, I would say, 1 year, 1.5 years, where there has been -- it has a bit more stability in terms of the taxes in Zambia and some relief in terms of certain of those previous tax meters that they introduced."

And I notably ask on interest expense, was there just a small, like timing difference in terms of when the cash outflow was relative to I think it's like your '23 and '25 notes. I think the coupon is technically April 1, but maybe it was paid at the end of last quarter. And that might explain why interest expense was only interest expense. Cash paid was only I think $66 million this quarter."

The $770 million to $810 million of total guidance, obviously, there's some noncash in that. Could you just refresh what the current view is of cash interest expense? And then as well, any additional cash items? I know -- I think it's $95 million or $100 million kind of at the end of the year to the Chorus group. Is there any other items that we should just make sure we're modeling correctly below the cash from ops line there?"
