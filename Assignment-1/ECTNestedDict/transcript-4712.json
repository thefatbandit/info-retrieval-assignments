         "Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, and welcome to Realogy\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Realogy\u2019s CEO and President, Ryan Schneider; and Chief Financial Officer, Charlotte Simonelli.",
         "As shown on Slide 3 of the presentation, the company will be making statements about its future results and other forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on the current expectations and the current economic environment. Forward-looking statements and projections are inherently subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of management, including any statements we make related to expectations with respect to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.",
         "Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. For those who\u2019ll listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein are as of today, July 30, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. Important assumptions and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified in our earnings release issued today as well as in our annual and quarterly SEC filings.",
         "Also, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call, and per SEC rules, important information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release. Lastly, for the second quarter of 2020, the relocation business continued to be reported as discontinued operations.",
         "Now I will turn the call over to our CEO and President, Ryan Schneider."
      ],
      "Charlotte Simonelli": [
         "Thank you, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into our financial performance, I would like to say, that I\u2019m very pleased by both the swift actions we took across Realogy, as well as the progress delivering on our strategic priorities. We adapted new ways of working and remained focused on emerging stronger on the other side. Amid this uncertain time, Realogy has become more agile and efficient and has effectively managed the areas of our business under our control.",
         "Now onto the second quarter performance. Q2 revenue was $1.2 billion, down 27% versus prior year due to lower closed transaction volume. While the year-over-year decline was expected, we have now seen new open transaction volume rebounding, especially later in Q2 and in July. Operating EBITDA from continuing operations was $172 million. We were pleased with this delivery in the midst of a crisis and benefited from strong cost management, exceptional performance from our GRA mortgage JV and improving closed transaction volume in the latter part of the quarter. Despite the volume decline, we held operating margin flat at the Realogy level in the quarter with a strong focus on cost management.",
         "Q2 operating EBITDA was down $63 million versus prior year, primarily driven by the closed transaction volume decline and by a 164 basis points year-over-year increase in agent commissions split. The higher commission splits year-over-year was primarily driven by upward pressure from retention efforts over the last 12 months and the mixed shift to higher performing agents in the quarter. We expect this pressure to continue in the second half of 2020. Our GRA mortgage JV contributed $35 million in operating EBITDA. This strong result was the combination of the strategic progress we made expanding geographic coverage, growing loan officers and improving service quality over the past year, which enabled us to capture more business.",
         "We also benefited from a very attractive Q2 mortgage environment, which has been driving a refinance boom. This demonstrates the power of our ancillary businesses, which is a strategic advantage, and we really liked the financials. We successfully reduced costs and reallocated spend. Collectively, operating marketing and G&A expenses declined $95 million in the quarter. The permanent cost reductions, we worked hard to deliver, continued to come to fruition and contributed to the quarter along with the temporary action we executed and realized in Q2.",
         "Given the improved transaction volume, we are saying, we have pulled back many of the temporary cost actions. We anticipate that approximately $30 million of the temporary cost savings will remain in the third quarter. We also expect nearly all temporary cost actions will be lifted by Q4. Finally, on cost, we are using learnings from this crisis to identify ways we can permanently lower our cost base across Realogy. It\u2019s too early to give you the overall numbers for 2021, and we still have work to do, but we are encouraged by our early findings. Just to give you one example, we expect to reduce administrative facilities by $10 million to $15 million in annual lease expense.",
         "We ended the quarter with $686 million in cash, inclusive of revolver borrowings we proactively drew down at the onset of COVID and generated free cash flow from continuing operations of $106 million, including discontinued operations, free cash flow was $47 million, as we saw a use of working capital driven by our securitization facility. We have been proactive with our balance sheet and remain committed to deleveraging. In early June, we executed an oversubscribed $550 million second lien notes offering maturing in 2025, thereby eliminating the 2021 notes overhang. The transaction lengthened our maturity profile while also supporting our near term liquidity.",
         "Our total net leverage ratio was 5.6 times. And the senior secured leverage ratio was 3.29 times as of June 30, 2020, well within compliance with our financial covenant in the second quarter. Finally, last week, we amended our credit agreement to ease the 4.75 times senior secured leverage ratio, financial covenant to 6.5 times commencing in Q3 2020 for four quarters, with a gradual return to the original level by mid 2022. This was accomplished for a minimal upfront cost with no change in pricing. As our Q2 results show, we are well in and expect to remain in compliance with our original covenant, but took this proactive measure as tail risk insurance for the next four to eight quarters.",
         "Overall, I am very pleased with our performance in Q2. Despite COVID related volume declines, we successfully managed costs to ensure operating EBITDA and free cash flow delivery in the quarter. We also continued delivering key strategic priorities during the quarter to ensure continued momentum.",
         "I will now turn the call back to Ryan to discuss what we are seeing more broadly across the business."

         "Good afternoon, and welcome to the Realogy Holdings Corp. Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call via Webcast. Today\u2019s call is being recorded, and a written transcript will be made available in the Investor Information section of the company\u2019s website tomorrow. A webcast replay will also be made available on the company\u2019s website.",
         "At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Realogy\u2019s Senior Vice President, Alicia Swift. Please go ahead, Alicia."
      ],
      "Ryan Schneider": [
         "Thank you for joining us this afternoon. I want to start by thanking Realogy employees, affiliated agents and franchisees for their dedication and hard work, helping customers safely buy and sell houses during these challenging times. I also want to thank our employees and agents for their openness sharing the different challenges COVID created in their local markets that openness helped us move quicker as a company to implement solutions to better support agents and customers. And finally, thanks to all of our employees for their thoughtful dialogue on diversity and inclusion, especially those who shared experiences that help all of us better understand the unique challenges people face today. And for all of you joining our call today, I hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy.",
         "Today\u2019s discussion will be structured like last quarter. I will start with summary remarks and key takeaways. Then turn over to Charlotte for a brief overview of the financials. And I will come back to talk about what we\u2019re seeing in the housing market, including early results from July. So I\u2019m excited to share our Q2 results and our continued strategic progress during this incredibly turbulent time. We demonstrated strong performance delivering a $172 million of operating EBITDA from continuing operations in Q2, even in the depths of the COVID crisis.",
         "Our operating EBITDA performance in the quarter was driven by three things. First, closed transaction volume across both our franchise and owned brokerage businesses fell dramatically in April and May, but improve markedly in June. We are seeing continued closed transaction volume improvement in July, and we are particularly excited by the very strong new open transaction volume we have seen in June and July, which I will share with you later in the call.",
         "Second, we delivered substantial cost reduction in the quarter, both temporary reductions, we shared with you on our last call and permanent savings we implemented in 2019. And third, our mortgage business had a very strong quarter. We made good strategic progress in this business in the past year, especially expanding our coverage in the market and greater integration with our brokerage business. This strategic progress combined with the obviously strong refinancing trends, help drive the quarter\u2019s results.",
         "And along with our operating EBITDA delivery, we continue to invest and drive our strategic agenda in the second quarter. So first, our technology focus and innovations are delivering results. We had substantial adoption acceleration of our products in the quarter. We delivered real expansion of our virtual capabilities in the past four months, virtual staging, virtual open houses, virtual tours, virtual title closings, virtual mortgage closings. We also continue to deliver marketing lead generation and other products to help agents do more deals. The combination of virtual capabilities, strong products and increased adoption helped agents drive volume successfully and safely during this crisis. And we are excited to virtualize and simplify the real estate transaction in the future.",
         "Second, we grew brokerage agents 2% year-over-year and our top two quartile agent retention improved a bit. The Q2 competitive environment was overshadowed by COVID, but pretty much continued the trend from Q1 of 2020 of being more rational than a year ago. Third, we continue to expand our other strategic growth initiatives. We are growing our Corcoran franchise. More broadly, we like the pace of franchise sales, even during COVID. We\u2019ve been able to do franchise sales and onboarding of new franchisees in a purely virtual manner, which will serve us well in the future. And we are increasing our marketing for high-quality lead generation efforts, like our new AARP program. And forth, we seize the market opportunity to refinance $550 million of debt at an attractive price. We retired our 2021 unsecured notes, improving our debt maturity profile and lengthening the term of the debt on our balance sheet.",
         "Putting this all together, we demonstrated resiliency in tough times. We feel good about our performance and trajectory. And we really like our position for the future, especially given the improving volumes we are seeing in June and July. But we are closely watching the COVID and macro uncertainty. I look forward to sharing more detail about what we are seeing in the housing market, what we\u2019re seeing in consumer behavior and our thoughts on the future later in the call.",
         "So I will now turn over to Charlotte to briefly discuss the financials.",
         "Thank you, Charlotte. What I want to do now is tell you what we\u2019re seeing in the world and what we expect in the future. So let me start with our numbers. So in Q2, Realogy\u2019s closed transaction volume was down 24%. Brokerage closed transaction volume is down 30% in the quarter, with June down 17%. Franchise closed transaction volume is down 20% in the quarter, with June only down 2%. And the main difference between our brokerage and franchise closed transaction volume numbers is the same geographic variation that we referenced last quarter. For example, in Q2, New York City closed transaction volume was down more than 50%.",
         "Now some of the delta is driven by price, since there were fewer Q2 transactions in the highest price ranges, e.g. million dollar plus homes where our brokerage business is just more heavily represent. But closed volume trends continue to improve in July based on the preliminary data through most of July, franchise closed transaction volume, excuse me, is up about 10% versus 2019 and brokerage closed transaction volume is up about 5% versus 2019. On the franchise side, the improving closed transaction volume is driven by price. And on the brokerage side, the improvement is from both units and price.",
         "More interesting for the future is what\u2019s happening with open transaction volume, which remember is the new contracts getting signed. Open volume is showing very strong growth. In June, open volume was up 21% versus 2019, up 30% in franchise and up 9% in brokerage. And again, most of the delta was driven by geographic variation. And based on the preliminary data through most of July, this trend continues to improve with both franchise and brokerage open volume up approximately 30% versus 2019.",
         "So what\u2019s driving such strong, open volume growth across both our brokerage and franchise businesses. So let\u2019s first, there\u2019s definitely some pent-up demand from the massive drop off we all saw in late March, April and May. And second there\u2019s no doubt, the incredibly low mortgage rates are helping more and more people buy homes. But third, low inventory is really driving up price. Today, we are seeing inventory down at least 15% or more in every price band compared to a year ago when inventory was already at historic lows. And that depth of inventory decline and especially the fact that the inventory is down across all price bands is something our most tenured industry leaders here, at Realogy, say they have not seen before.",
         "And then finally, we are seeing both incremental housing transactions and people willing to pay more for a house because of the societal shift driven by the COVID crisis. We are seeing increased demand for suburban living in multiple geographies, driving more transactions and higher prices. We are seeing increased rotation in homes within suburban markets as people\u2019s needs are changing, e.g. greater home office needs, e.g. putting a premium on outdoor space, e.g. the ability to live in a different geography given virtual work.",
         "We\u2019re seeing well-off consumers accelerate second home purchases. And frankly, we\u2019re seeing the already ongoing flights to attractive tax and weather destinations accelerated. And we see these four consumer shifts, I just mentioned, when we look across both the transaction data and the anecdotes we get \u2013 when we survey large numbers of consumers and agents across our brands. So we\u2019re really excited by what we\u2019re seeing in June and July, right? The new open volume is incredibly strong. But we\u2019re not running away too much with our excitement, and you shouldn\u2019t either, right?",
         "The volume drop in March, April and May was unprecedented. In the increase in open volume, we\u2019re seeing here in June and July is also unprecedented. And how long this growth will continue is hard to predict, right? There\u2019s macro and COVID uncertainty. And we just don\u2019t know how long trends like pent-up demand and like the consumer behavior changes we are seeing will last. So because of that, uncertainty, we are very focused on what is actually happening today and sharing that with you. We are not actually extrapolating too far into the future.",
         "So look, wrapping up, Q2 began with unprecedented challenges and an unprecedented drop in volume in our industry. And even though there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty at the start of the quarter, we are excited to execute too with $170 million in operating EBITDA from continuing operations. We moved very rapidly in the crisis. We demonstrated strong results on cost. We continue to drive strategic success like technology delivery, agent growth, corporate expansion, and mortgage.",
         "We strengthened our balance sheet and we\u2019ve even launched efforts to re-imagine our business and re-imagine how we operate the company. Putting all this together, especially coupled with the very strong and improving open volumes we\u2019re seeing in June and July. We really like our position for the future.",
         "So Charlotte and I look forward to taking your questions today."

            "Good evening, guys. Thank you. I appreciate the metrics on June and July trends. Now squaring that all up, do you have expectations for what you think transaction volumes will look like in 3Q and how that would break down by size versus price?"

         "Speaker": "Tommy McJoynt"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, look, we\u2019re not giving guidance on 3Q transaction volume, but I basically just gave you, the actual closed volume for the month of July most of the month. And I gave you our open volume in both June for the whole month and July month to date. Now open volume typically takes 45 to 50 days to turn into close volume. And look, there is a wide range around those numbers. Some deals closing one day. Some take six months. So there\u2019s a wide range around them. And then we\u2019ve got a little bit extra uncertainty here because with COVID restriction, you can \u2013 sometimes they can delay closings. And if there\u2019s a big problem, we did see a cancellation spike back in March a bit. So that could always change things. But look, the opens are kind of up 30-plus percent.",
            "And so you can do your own math on those things and your own assumptions about the distributions. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to give you prediction as much as to give you the actual numbers and let you decide how you think the world\u2019s going to go. And again, we really love the trends. We can\u2019t exactly say what will happen with August and September because of COVID and macro. But boy, that we love the trends and we thought giving you as much detail as we could effectively up through last week would be the most helpful thing of what we\u2019re seeing in the market and what applies for our future."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Got it, thank you. And switching gears, there\u2019s a few moving pieces in the franchise business this quarter. Obviously, some less marketing spend and you had announced the termination and the listing fee contracts. Could you just kind of walk through those moving pieces and have made an impact that segments bottom line?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Tommy McJoynt"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So on the franchise side of things, we did have lower marketing expenses. We also had a lower contribution into the brand marketing fund. And so those basically are more correlated the absence of the revenue, but also the absence of the spend. We actually recognize that in the P&L as it gets spent. So that\u2019s more of an EBITDA neutral. There were some minor impacts in the P&L. And I think, when we publish the Q, there\u2019ll be more information available for you in that. But the bigger driver on the franchise side was the absence of the brand marketing fund and then the marketing expense, and then the additional cost savings, the temporary cost savings that plowed through the P&L on a pro rata basis, sort of based on the number of employees we have. That\u2019s impacts across our business."

      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you and good afternoon. I guess my first question is, as you think about stronger housing market, which seems a little bit different than maybe what we were here for a few months ago. How do you think that ends impacting the competitive landscape and things like splits? Does that bring back the heated competition compared to maybe what things were working like a few months ago, or does that change that in some way? Any color there that\u2019d be great."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Anthony Paolone"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, I draw less. Look, the competitive environment, bluntly has not really been correlated with the housing market strength. 2018 and parts of 2019 were kind of flatten, in some cases, even down housing markets and the competitive environment at times with just incredible. We\u2019re happy to like Q2, like Q1, felt like a much more rational competitive environment the year before, still tough out there. And we\u2019re part of that tough competition out there in the market. The bigger thing probably for splits is, remember the stronger the volume is on \u2013 out there. The more people can kind of work their way up the tables.",
            "And so I think there may have been a hypothesis that going into COVID that we housing years. Maybe you won\u2019t have to pay as much in split because people don\u2019t do as much volume, but the stronger volume comes back, then the more bulk business people don\u2019t do. And, especially as the higher end agents like Charlotte talked about, you get kind of higher splits, kind of coming from that as people move up the tables. But look, we\u2019d rather have the stronger volume and pay people to move up the tables then the reverse. So we\u2019re okay with that. But the market strengthened and the competitive environments have not been really correlated. And I don\u2019t think that is, what\u2019s ever really driven the competitive environment. But there is the relationship with just pure volume and splits that we have talked about before."

      "10": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Got it. And then in the title and mortgage business, which did really well. Any senses to how much was just, the sheer amount of refinancing is quite strong, but just also, it sounded like maybe you all gained market share. And so I guess, particularly something like the guaranteed rate joint venture doing $35 million versus it was like $7 million a year ago. If you had this level of market share, what would last year been just trying to dissect those as we think about the future of these?"

         "Remarks": [
            "It\u2019s funny because of all the refi stuff, it\u2019s a little bit harder to rip that apart. But look, let me just tell you our story, right, which is, we started this new thing a couple of years ago and we lost money on it the first year we were building it up and, we started off with not the greatest position as we were building off something that had been kind of falling apart before. But boy, over the last couple of years, the team\u2019s worked really hard. We\u2019ve expanded the number of loan officers substantially, the quality of loan officers gotten better. We\u2019ve expanded our geographic coverage and guaranteed rate us on the mortgage title side. Our brokerage business has done a lot of work to better integrate this thing into the brokerage business to improve how much of our owned business, we capture effectively through our mortgage or excuse me, through our brokerage business.",
            "And that would have taken last year\u2019s number and definitely made it bigger all on its own. And then there was clearly a big chunk that comes from just the market here. So we haven\u2019t actually ripped it apart to get to the decimal points you\u2019re talking about, but we really liked the trajectory. And we liked the financials. And this shows the power of ancillary services and a lot of people talk about someday they\u2019ll make money from ancillary services, but we\u2019re doing it right now in this quarter was one of our better examples of it."

No one at Realogy, that I\u2019ve only been here a few years, but I talked to all of the veterans, no one has ever seen. Even if you go back to the great recession, the speed of the drop that happened in late March, April, especially, and no one has ever seen the speed of the comeback that\u2019s happened in June, July. Like we were talking to, we\u2019re going to have our busiest closing day we\u2019ve ever had since I\u2019ve been here tomorrow. And we were literally talking about taking people from other parts of our company to help our title team get closings done. And so it\u2019s just an unprecedented thing.",

There\u2019s a bunch of things in the economy right now that has economist by training, but thankfully never practice seem very hard to square in this unique environment we\u2019re in. You\u2019ve just hit on another one. I don\u2019t have an answer for you, but what I do have is the actual data that we\u2019re seeing in the market. And then what we\u2019re worried about that could hurt that down the road. But also just what the momentum is this more like housing market and our company has. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an answer that squares the circle on your question, just like three or four other kind of big macro contradictions out there in our economy right now."

            "We are not seeing that yet. We\u2019ve heard the same. There was a bit of noise in the jumbo market back in April, May. We may have even mentioned in our last call, if we got the question, I don\u2019t even remember. But it was \u2013 there was a bit of noise in the jumbo market about people tightening and a bit of a harder time getting mortgages, but we have not seen that playing out yet. Like the other factors that I listed that could be one of the things that slows down the party at some point here. But when you\u2019ve got macro uncertainty and COVID risk and some of the consumer trends and not knowing how long they\u2019re going to run, I would just put that on the list of things that could be a headwind to housing. But we\u2019re not seeing that be a headwind right now. And other than that jumbo market anecdote from a few months ago, this topic has not come up for me, my team or our mortgage business in the last couple of months."

And should we think about the cost saves is kind of a net reduction. Can you expend flight items?

So how you should think about it as in the two buckets, the first is the $70 million to $90 million that we talked about, which is pretty evenly, phased by quarter throughout the year. So those are the permanent cost reductions we had already announced. And then from a temporary cost save, we had the $80 million to $100 million that we delivered in Q2. And then that drops down to $30 million in Q3, and next to nothing in Q4. As far as reinvesting back, there\u2019s always other costs that hit the business. We do have slightly higher litigation right now, there\u2019s other things going on. But so it\u2019s not a direct correlation. Like there\u2019s some spend back in the business, but it\u2019s relatively minor."

So with the brokerage business accelerating up 30% in July and open transactions, and as you mentioned, Ryan, we\u2019re all trying to figure out kind of what\u2019s sustainable versus what\u2019s pushed out or pent-up. Maybe it\u2019d be helpful if you could talk through some of the geographies there, so trying to figure that out a little, I know you mentioned New York City being down 50% at one point. What\u2019s the recovery looks like there and in some of the other markets that were hit hardest versus, what did some of those markets that perhaps under the same level of lockdowns, et cetera. How did those trends versus to what degree have those markets accelerated? Thank you."

            "Yes, sure. That\u2019s a great question. Let me just give you some detail. I\u2019m only going to focus on the brokerage business and let me talk about open volume, which was kind of plus 30% through July. So look, New York City is still by far the toughest, just given the degree of lockdown and challenges there. It\u2019s still pretty substantially negative. It\u2019s not negative 50% anymore, but it\u2019s negative 30% to 40% still, when you look at July. The other one that was really tough, which is big for us was California was negative in terms of open volume through May, June was kind of breakeven. July is up 30%. But that\u2019s the first month up from after a lot of decline.",
            "Whereas, places like Florida were pretty good in June and very good in July way above 30%, Texas and Arizona even with the COVID situations there, plus 25%, 30%. New Jersey is one of those destination suburbs is up more than 50%. New England is up more than 30%. And so it\u2019s really, the geographies, the kind of did better through the April, May time, like, Florida and Texas, and maybe a New England have continued to be stronger than the average. The ones that were really tough, like in California, like in New York are improving. But are still out are kind of below the average. And but then the overall, obviously looking pretty good, but so we\u2019re watching it pretty closely at those local levels.",
            "And again, a lot of the things like New Jersey and New England is that suburban effect, I talk about. Connecticut is on fire, right? New Jersey is on fire, Florida, which also includes that vacation home and that would you call it, attractive tax weather thing, acceleration on the consumer side. So there\u2019s a lot of things coming together to lead to some of the regional strengths, and some of the regional challenges, but that\u2019s a little bit of local color what we\u2019re seeing on the brokerage side and franchises in the same ballpark, a little the numbers are different, but the direction is often the same."

It sounded like there\u2019s going to be a bit of mix in there, which may or not \u2013 may not normalize to some degree in the near term here. And then the retention side, which seems a little more structural and the question is really, if the market is normalized a year from now, however we want to define that could splits actually step back a bit for the first time in a while, or is 74% kind of the starting point.

We need to wait to see how it evolves right now.

What was the actual number in 2Q? And then the brokerage commissions were up year-over-year, which was encouraging. I was just wanting to make sure the lost USAA affinity business, we thought that that might push brokerage commissions down. Did that actually impact 2Q or not? We can start with those."

It\u2019s an increase year-over-year, because those transactions came at a lower commission split because of the high-quality led\u2026"

The pent up demand or whatever, or is this actually tied to secular forces, which we actually think it\u2019s the latter. But when you survey your customers, I know you\u2019ve done that. I\u2019m curious as to whether or not you\u2019re asking them when they decided to start their home purchase process, because I might give you a sense for whether you\u2019re seeing some pent up action or whether you\u2019re talking about people who\u2019ve just \u2013 it\u2019s like sort of just the demand has been created when COVID hit in the aftermath. So have you asked that question? Are you getting any sense from that?"

And for all we know it\u2019s already run out, possibly who knows. The price thing, the upward price benefit, we\u2019re all getting in volume on inventory that may run for a pretty long time because there\u2019s just not that much inventory out there. And even when you look at the July new listings, there\u2019s clearly a lot more demand than the new inventory coming to the market.",
            "The real big question is how long do you kind of secular consumer changes are going to kind of go on. And from the survey stuff and the agent anecdotes and franchisee anecdotes, I get, I think a lot of that \u2013 the decision, it was not pent up demand, it\u2019s decisions people have made in months like May and June, for example, right? Hence more June and July kind of open volume strength. And some of those have some natural ends to them, right? If people are accelerating their second home purchases, which isn\u2019t that big of a \u2013 in the scheme of things, in my view, there\u2019s still \u2013 you\u2019re only going to do one second on purchase property. So, some of that\u2019s going to run out. The more secular shift to suburban living and some of the rotation within the suburban markets, that\u2019s the one \u2013 those are the ones with both the big numbers associated with them, but also the big uncertainty of, is it a small group of people kind of rush into the accidents to do those things, or is that a really big secular trend that could go on for a long time.",
            "And I just think we\u2019re too early, right, to actually know the answer to that yet, because again, we\u2019re kind of looking at seven weeks here, a very interesting kind of unprecedented volume acceleration. And so that\u2019s why we kind of focused on look, here\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing and even telling you what we\u2019re seeing in the different local geographies for the previous question. But there\u2019s a real chance that this thing is got a lot of legs to it, but there\u2019s also a real chance that whether it\u2019s COVID, the macro or something else, you could \u2013 this thing could kind of like fall off a cliff pretty quickly and go back to kind of a normal housing market. I think the low rates parts probably here with us for awhile and that\u2019s very favorable. So those are my thoughts, but that\u2019s also why we\u2019ve probably gone more detail in this call than we usually do and how we\u2019re thinking about the future."

If we\u2019re in just to kind of a volume bubble here, right? What you would do on the cost is different than if you\u2019re in a much stronger housing market for multiple years, in terms of kind of how you\u2019d want to kind of manage the margin and make sure you\u2019re investing to support a much larger volume than your kind of you\u2019ve been used to dealing with this industry for many years. So that\u2019s probably the easiest one. I think there\u2019s some of the stuff on what we\u2019re doing virtualizing the transaction that will be increasingly helpful if this is an ongoing trend. And then, I like our position in business mix.",

Even like a New York City, we love our business in Manhattan and Brooklyn, it\u2019s huge, but go add up our business between Sotheby\u2019s, Coldwell Banker and Corcoran on Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey.

I mean, the inventory for the last, whatever two and a half years has been pretty historically low when you look at how many months inventory are out there, right? If six months is the historical average, it\u2019s been like four months inventory for a couple years and it\u2019s even less right now. And all the things that have historically shaken a little bit of inventory, like the higher price thing have actually not done to your point. Look, I still believe there\u2019s a huge new construction thing going on here, where as a society, we\u2019re just not building enough homes period of any type. And you can see it in the new construction numbers and where they are relative to like, even just the late 1990\u2019s and stuff like that.",
            "And there\u2019s all kind of reasons for that. So I think that\u2019s a piece. The thing that may do a little more unlocking though to me, if I was going to look for a positive is that thing we\u2019re seeing of kind of rotation in the suburban market where people want to need different things. But when we survey, thousands of customers and agents, what people want to need different isn\u2019t the same thing, right? Some people are looking for more on the home office side or more on the external space side, others have those things, but don\u2019t want or need them as much as before. And that might be able to actually unlock some inventory if that suburban rotation is not a temporary thing and is a longer thing.",

But I do think we\u2019re well positioned to capture, whether it comes in units or price. And because of that suburban massive presence we have, I talked about, I think, where the world is going is in our favor. But we would love more inventory out there too."

            "Thank you so much guys for squeezing me in. So two quick ones, one the commission rate, and I apologize if I missed this earlier. But the commission rate actually ticked up a bit in both the franchise and own side of the business. And I think that\u2019s the first time in a while we\u2019ve actually seen that tick higher. I think in this industry, typically when inventory is very tight, you actually can see some compression on the commission rate, just given kind of the competition amongst agents. So curious if you can just comment on kind of what drove that this quarter? And then second question on the Corcoran side of things, on the franchise we\u2019ve seen some of the announcements. I\u2019m just curious what you can say regarding kind of the pipeline and how things are going thus far relative to maybe how you expected things to go. Obviously COVID throws a bit of a wrench into things. But just curious big picture how that\u2019s going versus you anticipated. And ultimately what the pipeline is looking like in that side of things. Thank you."

            "Thanks, Ryan. I\u2019ll take both of your questions. So look, on the average broker commission rate. Look, we were happy to see it tick up a little bit in franchise and brokerage. And that\u2019s great. We don\u2019t see a trend there, something that numbers kind of bounces around. When you really look back at it over the last, not just a couple of years, but multiple years, those numbers are pretty stable. And a lot of times they move around because of mix. I don\u2019t think this quarter was because of mix. But we\u2019ll take the fact that it was a little bit better, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s yet a macro trend there.",
            "The part of the reason, I think it didn\u2019t go down, you may want to keep in mind is actually the power of agents. I know you talked about agent competition, but there\u2019s \u2013 agents earn this commission in my belief because they actually provide real value. And agents, I think provided even more value during the COVID kind of quarter that we just finished. In terms of the work they were able to do to help customers set the right price, often a higher price, by the way, to the customer\u2019s benefit and to get deals done in a much more uncertain and much more health and safety kind of time.",
            "So, the uses of agents in Q2, I bet is actually up versus normal. That\u2019s a guess, I don\u2019t have the data, but that\u2019s my guess. And I think you should remember, all of the eye buyers shut down and agents powered on and agents got hundreds of thousands of deals done, Realogy agents and other agents. And so, you can see a little bit of a market dynamic there where, somebody has other price or other options kind of went away. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of news in that other than it\u2019s kind of continues to be a relatively stable thing out there. But I do think that there\u2019s \u2013 people are using agents and frankly, maybe even more during this crisis because agents are helping customers power through and get their homes bought and/or sold safely. So I\u2019m a big fan.",
            "And I think they\u2019re actually proved a lot of it in the quarter. Look on the Corcoran side, we\u2019re excited about the franchise launch. We\u2019re excited that, we\u2019re building a portfolio, we added a couple more \u2013 our first Corcoran franchisee just bought a great firm in Northern California to expand. That\u2019s great. We\u2019ve got a pipeline. We can\u2019t publicly announce the \u2013 what\u2019s already been signed and what\u2019s going to be announced soon, hopefully. But we\u2019ve got a good pipeline. We feel good about it. Just like our Sotheby\u2019s business that we launched, whatever it was, coming up on 15 years or more than 15 years ago or Better Homes and Gardens, it was a dozen years ago. You don\u2019t build these franchise businesses overnight, but boy, we\u2019re excited by the build we\u2019ve had so far and what the pipeline looks. And we really like obviously the economics of franchise real estate, especially at the high end where Corcoran plays. So thank you, Ryan, for both those good questions."
