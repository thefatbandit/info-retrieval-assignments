         "This is the Swedish Match second quarter 2020 telephone conference and with me today are Lars Dahlgren, our President and CEO; and Tom Hayes, our CFO.",
         "In the Investors section of our swedishmatch.com website, you will find the presentation for today's call, which is intended to be viewed in conjunction with our prepared commentary, so we encourage you to follow along with that presentation. After our prepared commentary, we will be taking questions.",

         "Slides 3 of this presentation reiterate the headline bullets from our Interim Report released this morning and we refer you to the report rather than repeating them on this call.",
         "I will now turn the conference call over to Lars Dahlgren, who will begin on Slide 4.",

      "Lars Dahlgren": [
         "Thank you, Emmett, and hello everyone. As you may recall, we have a new product segment reporting structure from the beginning of this year. And on Slide 4, we present the sales and the EBIT split under this new segmentation for January to June period of 2020 as well as for 2019.",
         "Due to the rapid growth of Smokefree volumes in the U.S. and most notably ZYN nicotine pouches, the Smokefree product segment has increased its relative share of group results for the first six months of 2020 and accounted for nearly two thirds of our product segments sales and nearly three quarters of operating profit from product segments.",
         "On Slide 5, you can see our sales split by geography as well as the geographical base for each of our product segments for the year-to-date period of 2020 and with a half-year 2019 percentage split per emphasize. Approximately two-thirds of Swedish Match's states from product segments sourced from the U.S.",
         "Within this Smokefree segment, the U.S. is now the largest contributor to sales, having surpassed Scandinavia, which accounts for a bit more than 40% of the Smokefree total. Our Lights, a substantial portion of sales come from markets outside Scandinavia and the U.S., most notably countries in Asia and Europe, including Russia, as well as Brazil.",
         "Moving to Slide 6. Last quarter, we presented a slide on COVID-19 impacts as well as our view of the outlook for the second quarter as the COVID pandemic began to take hold in our markets. During the end of the first quarter, we noted unusually high levels of orders by the trade for our products, most notably for our offerings in the U.S. We had anticipated that a high percentage of the trade hoarding would unwind in the second quarter. This was indeed the case for U.S. moist snuff business and to a lesser extent foreseen in the U.S.",
         "For our U.S. chewing tobacco business; however, our shipment volumes in the second quarter were very strong and it does not appear the second quarter shipment volumes were impacted by the unwinding of trade inventories which could imply unwinding effects in future quarters. For our Scandinavian Smokefree business and for international market expansion projects, border closures and other restrictions had a notable impact on volumes as we lost the vast majority of our volumes normally delivered to travel retail and border shops, and had to slowdown planned launch activities for nicotine pouches in new markets.",
         "As a consequence of travel restrictions, however, domestic and regional shipments were exceptionally strong. The pandemic also required that we put in place a number of hygiene and social distancing protocols in our factories, offices and for our sales force. These necessary steps resulted in extra cost during the quarter and negatively impacted production efficiencies in our manufacturing facilities. For our cigar facility in the Dominican Republic, while staffing levels gradually return to more normal levels toward end of the of April following its temporary closures. COVID-19 safety measures limited production output, resulting in relatively steep declines in natural leaf shipments and increased back quarter.",
         "Our capacity expansion projects for nicotine pouches in both the U.S. and Scandinavia are continuing according to plan. We will touch on COVID-19 related impacts further in the product segment commentary, but do note that one should expect the continuation of elevated costs as well as continuous shipments volatility during this pandemic period. Forecasting with any level of precision is challenging in this environment, but we have been pleased to see recent improvements to production output from our Dominican Republic cigar facility and some increased activity in the Scandinavian travel retail and border trade channels.",
         "With that said, underlying markets and businesses remain strong, and I remain confident in our ability to demonstrate diligence and agility during these uncertain times, while remaining focus on the opportunities that present themselves over the long-term.",
         "Slide 7 highlights a few key points from the quarter regarding our product segments. The strong performance for Smokefree was once again the main contributor to our sales and earnings growth with ZYN in U.S. standing out as the key driver of sales and operating profit growth. By impressive on an underlying basis, the financial performance for us in the U.S. also benefited from reduced marketing spend compared to the prior year period, with the comparison being impacted by reduced activity and some postponement of consumer marketing efforts in the quarter due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as costs in conjunction with the national rollout in the prior year periods.",
         "For our Scandinavian Smokefree business, aggregated shipment volumes were negatively impacted by continued border closures and traveled restriction due to COVID-19; however, positive products and counter mix shifts counteracted the adverse volume effect and both sales and operating profit grow in local currency compared to the prior year. A noteworthy consequence of the closed Swedish border trade was the dramatic increase in purchase volumes on the Norwegian domestic markets.",
         "Light channel and market shifts make it more challenging to get the true read on category developments, we estimate as the overall Scandinavian market with snus and nicotine pouches continue to experience solid category growth. For Cigars, our ability to produce HTL cigars in dose in Alabama in the U.S. was a distinct advantage for Swedish Match as we were able to increase their overall shipments year-on-year despite the reduced production output from natural leaf cigars from our Dominican facility.",
         "The increased shipment volumes were the result of significant increase in sales for HTL cigars, which translated into the negative mixed effects for the quarter. Our Lights business delivered strong financial results with higher operating profit for both matches and lighters despite lower sales for lighters. Profits were the higher as reported, but also in adjusting for restricting charges in last year's second quarter and for the land sales that benefits the second quarter of this year. Match volumes were robust due in part to trade loading in Brazil in anticipation of an announced price was increased.",
         "With that, I will hand over to Tom for some additional comments on the performance for each of our product segments."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Swedish Match Q2 Report 2020. For the first part of this call, all participants will be in listen-only mode. And afterwards, there will be a question-and-answer session.",
         "Today, I' pleased to present Mr. Emmett Harrison. Please begin your meeting."
      ],
      "Tom Hayes": [
         "Thank you, Lars. On Slide 8 and 9, we've summarized some of the quarterly highlights for the Smokefree products segment which includes snus, nicotine pouches, moist snuff and chewing tobacco. Beginning with snus to nicotine pouches on Slide 8, ZYN in the U.S. was once again a major contributor to sales and operating profit growth with a Smokefree segment. Shipment volumes during the quarter for ZYN in the U.S. were 26 million cans and total shipment volume during the first six months of 2020 has already surpassed total 2019 shipment volumes.",
         "We had previously estimated that first quarter shipment volumes benefited from 2 million cans of COVID-19 distributor hoarding and approximately 1 million cans of pipeline sales attributable to new stores added during the first quarter. While difficult to determine with precision, we estimate that unwinding of hoarding negatively affected Q2 shipments by close to 1 million cans. And based on that and measuring distributor shipments to retail, second quarter volumes of ZYN grew by 10% sequentially from the first quarter.",
         "The pace of new store distribution slowed during the second quarter, and distribution bill through the remainder of the year will be limited somewhat due to overall production capacity constraints. With regard to our Scandinavian business, we estimate that the decline in shipment volume was exclusively attributable to COVID-19 effects.",
         "With borders closed as Lars mentioned, Norwegian domestic volume was exceptionally strong as consumers did not have the option of buying the products in Sweden. When comparing Nielsen data to deliveries, it appears that Swedish Match Q2 shipments to Norway were further elevated as the Norwegian trade inventories at the close of Q1 were ahead normally low levels.",
         "The higher Norwegian volumes were positive to our price and portfolio mix. Unfortunately, the depreciation of the NOK compared to the SEK eroded much of that added benefits. Outside of Scandinavia, we were successful in adding two countries to the geographies with ZYN, and nicotine pouches are available as points of trade. However, due to lockdowns, travel restrictions and store closures in a number of markets, we had to modify and in some cases defer our sales and marketing activities in new markets.",
         "Turning to Slide 9 and moist snuff in the U.S., where we reported improved shipment volumes despite trade unwinding for the first quarter COVID-19 hoarding. In large part due to our simplified pricing promotion strategy for Longhorn, both sales and operating profit were down however, due to both portfolio mix shifts and higher manufacturing costs related to COVID. We once again gain market share in the faster growing pouch segment of the market. In this quarter, our share was in the moist snuff pouch segments surpassed our overall share within the moist snuff category.",
         "For U.S. chewing tobacco, like for moist snuff, we noted increased orders in Q1 from wholesalers and retailers likely tied to the COVID-19 hoarding. Unlike moist snuff, however, we could not see any discernible unwinding of trade inventory during the second quarter and shipment volumes increased compared to the prior year. The long-term decline trend of chewing tobacco categories likely to continue, so once should consider the year-on-year volume growth during the quarter to be an exception rather than the norm.",
         "For chewing tobacco outside the U.S., our chew bags and chew bits, shipment volumes for the quarter declined, compared to the prior year, most notably in Germany for a recent court verdict adversely impacted future growth opportunities for chew bags in that market.",
         "On Slide 10, we show the volume trends for the combined snus and nicotine pouch category for Sweden and Norway together, as measured by Nielsen. With border closures and changes in purchasing patterns, it is much more difficult to properly assess market dynamics in individual markets. When looking more on an aggregated view, we believe that combined categories demonstrating continued strong growth in consumer off-take led by the rapid growth of nicotine pouches.",
         "On Slide 11, we presented a standard slide to depict the market trends for the snus category on the volume and value basis as well as market shares in Sweden, according to Nielsen. While Nielsen measures have experienced more volatility and should therefore be viewed more directionally within the COVID context, two points are worth commenting on are, the decline in rates of year-on-year growth for this news category and the weaker relative performance in retail value development in Sweden.",
         "The decline in snus growth rate is at least in part attributable to travel restrictions of the decline in retail value is attributable to channel shifts within Sweden, but we saw a significant volume declines in the more premium price channels like convenience, with stronger volumes and more price sensitive channels like groceries. The value price segment share of the market remained relatively stable compared to the prior year, and Swedish Match's total market share in the category declined 1.2 points compared to the prior year principally due to segment mix shifts and 0.9 points sequentially primarily due to market share losses in the value and Premium 2 segments.",
         "On Slide 12, we have presented the market share trend -- the market trends and market shares for nicotine pouch categories in Sweden according to Nielsen. Supported by strong competitive activity in terms of product launches and in store visibility, the nicotine pouch category has doubled in size over the past year and is now roughly 8% relative to this snus category. Swedish Match's share in the nicotine pouch category has remained relatively stable and our continued objective is to capture a higher percentage of growth within this attractive category. Recall that in terms of pricing during non-promotional periods, nicotine pouches are typically priced in line with or above the Premium 1 snus products and the dramatic growth of nicotine pouches have therefore contributed to a positive price mix effect in the combined category.",
         "Now turning to Slide 13 and to the left, we have presented total combined snus and nicotine pouch category, volume and retail value development on a trended basis for the Norwegian market according to Nielsen. The impact of border closures between Norway and Sweden is quite evident and dramatic in the quarter. Once the borders reopen, Norwegians are more freely able to travel to Sweden; we should expect the extreme level of in-country purchases to revert to more normal levels.",
         "Even at Norway is an all premium market, the shift from Swedish border purchases to Norwegian domestic purchases provided Swedish Match with price mixed benefits during the quarter that more than compensated for the lost Swedish border trade volumes. Swedish Match has gained market share within the snus category, and although we have lost market share within the nicotine pouch category compared to the prior, our market share has remained relatively stable on a sequential basis.",
         "On Slide 14, you can see that the nicotine pouch segment in Norway has grown dramatically over the past two years; and in the nicotine pouch segment, even with our own strong volume growth, our share progression remain a challenge.",
         "On Slide 15, the chart illustrates the dramatic growth of ZYN nicotine pouches in the U.S. on a trailing 12 month basis. Please bear in mind that shipment volumes do not always fully align in timing or magnitudes with consumption volumes, particularly in periods of significant store distribution build due to inventory stocking or destocking effects at the wholesaler or retailers level. In our last interim report conference call, we noted that shipment volumes during the first quarter benefited from both pipeline and COVID-19 effect.",
         "On Slide 16, we have summarized trended volume and market shares by brand within the nicotine pouch category in the U.S. based on distributor shipments to retail. ZYN is now available nationally in the U.S. and despite being in fewer stores and another nicotine pouch competitor, and expanding distribution and aggressive price promotion by other competitors, ZYN's market leading share has remained resilient.",
         "As competition increases and the market expand, our ability to maintain market shares at these levels will become increasingly difficult, but the trend so far is very promising. And with a rapidly growing category, it is still possible to deliver continued volume growth despite market share losses. So I'd like to remind you, however, that until the next phase of capacity expansion is operational, continued volume growth could be limited by capacity constraints.",
         "On Slide 17, you can see the size of our ZYN brand in the U.S. relative to a number of benchmarks in the established western region, as well as for all national launch markets on a trended basis based on distributor shipments to retail. The trend rate can experience fluctuations to distributor ordering patterns as well as promotional activities, but moist snuff -- backed by moist snuff and nicotine pouch competitors. While the growth trends for some of the benchmark has softened, we are encouraged that we continue to see growth in both the western region and regions outside the west despite aggressive promotional pricing and distribution efforts by nicotine pouch competitors in the second quarter.",
         "Looking at U.S. moist stuff on Slide 18, we've summarized trended quarterly category and Swedish Match growth rates based on distributor shipments to retail. It is fairly evident that Q1 2020 growth rates have been favorably influenced by COVID-19 porting activities and an unwinding occurred during the second quarter. MSA data indicates that Swedish Match volumes continue to outpace the categories led by pouches in the second quarter. As noted earlier, we are seeing favorable trade and consumer response to our simplified price promotion strategy for Longhorn contributing to the year-on-year share gains for our moist snuff portfolio.",
         "Looking at U.S. chewing tobacco on Slide 19, where we once again outperform the overall category in both the premium and value segments. Earlier in this presentation, we noted that shipments in the quarter for own brands were up versus the prior year. Over longer periods, there has generally been new single digit volume decline annually for both the market and for Swedish Match, with a shift from premium products more towards value price brands. Our year-to-date shipment volume growth of 1% is likely an anomaly of COVID-19 related distributor purchasing behavior, which could result in distributor destocking in future quarters.",
         "On Slide 20, we've presented some of our recent new products and market activities for snus and nicotine pouches. In the U.S. through 2019, the three depicted U.S. ZYN varieties, which include the citrus flavored SKU, in addition to two unflavored varieties, had only been available in the western region. During this year and especially during Q2, we have expanded the availability of these products nationally. In May of this year, we re-launched our one range of products on the Swedish Match, which provides consumers with a powerful taste experience, featuring large well built pouches and center pouch paper for improved mouth-fill all packaged in a more contemporary design.",
         "Early indications are that this overhaul and brand transition has been successful with one game share within the attractive Premium 2 segments in Sweden. In addition to the one range of products, we also expanded our assortment for ZYN in Sweden, and G4 nicotine pouches in both Sweden and Norway. Our activities and new markets for ZYN outside of Scandinavia and the U.S. have been limited recently due to COVID-19 restrictions, but we were successful in launching the ZYN into a number -- limited number of stores in both Bosnia and Poland since the first quarter.",
         "Moving to Slide 21 in Cigars, Swedish Match cigar shipment volumes increased 2% compared to the prior year, as our shipments for HTL cigars more than offset declines for natural leaf varieties, which resulted from our inability to meet customer orders following the closure and subsequent phase reopening of the Dominican Republic manufacturing facility. The overall cigar category appears to be very strong right now possibly impacted by COVID-19 related changes and consumption patterns. Operating profits and operating margin were down due to both mixed shifts and higher manufacturing costs heavily influenced by COVID-19 related factors.",
         "On Slide 22, we've presented a quarterly trend of Swedish Match cigar shipment volumes as well as our estimate of the U.S. match market cigar category and segment volume development based on distributor shipments to retail. Swedish Match utilizes the externally developed MSA dataset and revisions the historical reporting periods are common as retail stores and distributors are added to the dataset. Based on MSA measures of distributors shipments to retail, total cigar category volumes increased by more than 10% for the first six months of the year, compared to a category growth rate of slightly more than 2% for full year 2019.",
         "Swedish Match's volume under this same measure increased by 15% in the first six months of 2020 with Swedish Match significantly outperforming the category and the HTL segments while growing at a slower rate than the category for natural leaf cigars influenced markedly by COVID-19 production constraints.",
         "On Slide 23, you can see a split of cigar fault volumes for Swedish Match and the comparable market during the second quarter, and on the right side of the slide, you can see our shipping volume trend. The production constraints experienced by our Dominican Republic facility is evidenced by the sharp decline in trended natural leaf varieties as well as the composition of our portfolio in the quarter. Normally, close to two thirds of our portfolio is comprised of natural leaf cigars, if these cigars represented only 55% of our shipments during the quarter.",
         "Moving on to Slide 24 in our Lights products segment, adjusted for currency translation effects, sales for the segment were up 14% and operating profit was also sharply higher. Match has benefited most notably from strong volumes, but also from improved product mix. In one of our larger markets, Brazil, it was the benefit of trade loading of matches in anticipation of an announced price increase.",
         "We sold some land in Brazil this quarter for a gain of SEK6 million and last year's second quarter results included restructuring charges of approximately SEK12 million, both related to matches. Excluding these items, the operating profit for matches was also considerably higher year-on-year. For lighters, volumes were down, but with improved positive product mix, tight control, cost controls and reduced raw material pricing, most notably for nylon, operating profits also improved compared to the prior year.",
         "On the regulatory front on Slide 25, you can see some of the more notable regulatory events, which have occurred during the second quarter. With regard to the FDA in cigars, we note that the filing deadline for FDA applications has been extended to September and we are well positioned to meet the filing deadline.",
         "For chewing tobacco in Germany, the federal administrative court has decided not to grant leave to appeal a lower court decision on Thunder chew bag, so that decision is now final. This is a product specific ruling, but nonetheless, we anticipate that there may be a cessation of sale of most chew bags in their current form in Germany. Sales of chew bags on the German market during the six month period ended June 30, 2020, amounting to SEK46 million and are included within other markets in the Smokefree product segments specification.",
         "On Slide 26, we summarized relevant metrics from our interim report relating to finance costs, our financial position and earnings per share. That finance costs during the quarter increased relative to levels that we've experienced in the past, principally due to higher debt levels as well as low returns on our surplus cash position. The weighted average interest rate of our loan portfolio at June 30th was 2.05% compared to 2.08% at the end of 2019.",
         "Our net debt to EBITDA for the 12 months periods in the June 30th was 2.1. During the first six months, new bond loans of SEK3.175 billion were issued and repayments of bond loans amounted to SEK500 million. During the remainder of 2020, SEK800 million of this debt falls due for payment. As of June 30, 2020, Swedish Match had SEK1.500 billion in unutilized committed credit lines, and cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK3.970 billion at June 30, 2020, compared to SEK2.370 billion at December 31, 2019.",
         "The net debt as of June 30th amounted to SEK13.384 billion compared to SEK11.925 billion at December 31, 2019. The capital duration was 4.2 years with 98% of the portfolio is subject to fixed interest rates. The EPS bridge illustrates the components of our 28% year-to-date growth in EPS, and apart from the after tax effect of our increased operating profits, the reduced number of shares had a meaningfully positive impact.",
         "During the first half of the year, we made share repurchases in the amounts of SEK1.435 billion buying 2.4 million shares at an average price of about SEK596 per share, and during the second quarter, an ordinary dividend of SEK2.20 billion for the 2019 financial years was paid out to shareholders.",
         "Slide 27 simply restates our 2020 outlook from the interim report, which remains unchanged. Our CapEx plans remain on track to be considerably above the 2019 level, and we continue to foresee good market growth for Smokefree nicotine products. While we continue to expect the effective corporate tax rate for the full year to fall within the 22% to 23% range noted in the outlook, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar or more rapid growth of the U.S. businesses compared to where Scandinavian businesses could place added upward pressure on our consolidated group effective tax rates.",
         "And finally, as always, fluctuations in currency rates will affect our future reported results and you may want to take note some of the more important average exchange rates versus the SEK. The average exchange rate in the third quarter of 2019 for the U.S. dollar was 9.6; the NOK, it was 1.08; and the Brazilian real, it was 2.42.",

            "A couple of questions. Firstly, question on ZYN, the current operating margin, counting backwards, it sounds like you are looking at an operating margin right now. That is kind of in the upper end of the 50% to 55% range. Can you confirm this? And can you also elaborate a bit on where you expect this could go, going forward? On the one hand, hampered by increased marketing and maybe price pressure; on the other hand, there is positive scale effects and fewer kickbacks to newly launched retailers, if you could just elaborate on that? That's my first question."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Niklas, I'd say your estimate is good and that the margin that we're experiencing for ZYN in the U.S. right now is heightened expected -- heightened relative to what our expectations were. I would point out that, the extent of marketing that we have been able to do whether it's due to COVID-19 effects or similarly due to the fact that, the general production constraints.",
            "We've been less aggressive in looking to match some of our competitor activities on price promotion in market. So, I guess in some, yes, we do have an operating margin for ZYN the U.S. that is at -- within kind of at or above slightly the range that you specified. But we would expect that margin to moderate, as production quantities come online and as our marketing efforts that were curtailed in the second quarter are able to be put in place."

And then sticking to ZYN, but looking at the European rollouts, obviously a difficult quarter in terms of rolling out the new markets, but can you still elaborate a little bit on what kind of volumes you are seeing in Europe? Are there any markets where you're seeing any similar performance per store as what you've seen in the U.S. rollout?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. And can you also say something more about the regulatory environment? You've mentioned here the FDA regulation on flavors and you've mentioned the date the 9th of September. What do you think the likelihood is? Are you seeing any indication of a flavor ban actually coming in place by the 9th of September?"

As you know, we've already filed our PMTA applications for ZYN, and we stand well equipped to file for our cigar assortment by this deadline.",
            "FDA has indicated themselves that in terms of labor enforcement, they will avail of the SE process. Exactly what that means remains to be determined, whether they will -- it becomes a bit speculative at where they put higher thresholds so to say on what it's actually considered to be substantially equivalent product, if it a flavored products, compared to non-flavored products, that's remains to be seen.",
            "But in terms of federal flavor regulation across all assortment there seems to be a delay, if you listen to what FDA communicates on in terms of prioritizing their agenda. So not too long ago, they talked about coming out with a proposed rule in March of this year, and based on recent communication, at the earliest I'd say towards the end of the year."

      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And on the same topic, but for the European market. As I understand nicotine pouch is more or less entirely unregulated today, and then that might change with the new implementation report from May 2021. Are you seeing any indications there where the market is heading? And for specific countries like Sweden, Norway, Denmark, what are the moves in terms of regulation for nicotine pouches?"

         "Speaker": "Niklas Ekman"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "First of all, if you talk about the evaluation and subsequent revision of the tobacco directive, as you pointed out, that is a possibility that nicotine pouches would be folded in, in the tobacco directive. Similar to what e-cigarettes, e-cigarettes were in the last round, albeit that ZYN today is not a tobacco product, but we think that a common regulation within the tobacco directive could potentially to rather be good for the category as between one go, you would have an inconsistent approach on that regulator, the product.",
            "Because as you point out right now, it's more country specific and there are various examples there. I mean, you take the Czech Republic, as we understand, if there is a proposal to regulate nicotine pouches in, what we've considered a reasonable and rational manner. If you take Sweden, the government has appointed an inquiry that will evaluate tobacco regulation including looking at nicotine pouches. But -- and the report there is not due until 2021, and then when you see what kind of proposals come after that. In Sweden, though, the product is taxed and so it's in that sense recognized by these regulators.",
            "And similar in, in Denmark, there was a political compromise regarding tobacco products. I think it was at the end of last year or the very beginning of this year, where nicotine pouches were singled out, and at least for a two year period where they would -- where they would monitor the development in terms of consumption uptake and so forth. And the youth prevalence that planned flavor ban would not be included in such regulation for nicotine pouches while for example, our chewing tobacco products, as the proposal read would be included. However, we haven't seen and that could be COVID-related just on terms of political agenda. We haven't seen any sharp proposals yet.

And in both those slides presented in different ways, but nonetheless is absolutely common in both, but the growth of nicotine pouches as a category and indeed yours, has slowed according to shipments in the MSA data. And I was wondering what you should read into that? Suddenly, you could make the argument that, actually, demand is slowing. Because if you were capacity constrained and everybody really wanted this product, I would expect Velo to at least remain stable as opposed to decline. Anyway, I'd just like to comment on the current slowdown with actual slowdown shown in on Slide 16 and 17. Thank you. That's my first question."

            "I mean, first of all, Adam, I would urge you to be a little bit careful with quarterly comparisons this year due to the kind of extraordinary circumstances in the marketplace caused by COVID-19. So, I mean, the number in terms of volumes in the MSA data, as Tom stated, has a sequential growth of 10% on shipments from distributors to the retail. And when you look at that more closely on a weekly data, you also see that similar to shipments that we reported that then go into distributors.",
            "The MSA data indicates that there was COVID-related hoarding towards the end of the first quarter and unwinding of the, some of that hoarding in the in the second quarter. So, in that sense, you can say that the underlying MSA growth is actually stronger on a sequential basis. But again, you need to be careful and there are kind of seasonal factors in here, so, even some other categories, the second quarter normally is a little bit stronger.",
            "So, I think, one has to see in these very special times, it's extra important to look a little bit more on the long-term. And what is clear to us is that the category has continued growing nicely and that it has continued to -- the growth has been at least in our case in driven by increased velocity rather than expanded distribution and the inspection or the availability, national availability of new SKUs including these unflavored products.",
            "And on the next slide where you look at these benchmarks, I mean then you get into further details and you have kind of two categories to play with. So, here it becomes extra susceptible to quarterly fluctuations, and you need to bear in mind that we're only reporting here ZYN volumes relative moist snuff category. And if you take the regions outside, the west, there we have seen -- although, our overall market share, it's more or less stable between the first and the second quarter. Overall, market share in what we can call the expansion market has declined a bit. So, you need to add competitive volumes of sale to those benchmarks, if you want to evaluate the home category. And when you're into the west, you're into an even smaller data set and therefore, additionally vulnerable to kind of quarterly fluctuations in ordering patterns.",
            "Long story short we feel very good about the continued growth. And even if there's a slowdown on a sequential basis, it's very strong and we have seen some of this very strange demand in other categories. So to the extent that some of this, for example, if you smoke more cigars, because you're not in a workspace right smoking band, while maybe when you get back to your workplace you go back to using your snus."

We have more recent example of a statewide flavor ban in Massachusetts that only went in force 1st of June of this year. And in that market what we saw was once again based on distributor shipments to retail was in essence a replacement of the velocities of a broader assortment, including flavor SKUs of ZYN with our unflavored varieties. Now, I think it's probably still somewhat early to draw firm conclusions that it's a complete replacement of those SKUs, because some of that obviously is selling those unflavored SKUs into those points of retail.",
            "And in California kind of more broadly it\u2019s not one of our highest performing velocity states. And then if you look more specifically at counties or cities within California, it becomes that more challenging to capture a read on what you see, because it's not that difficult if you're talking about a county or local flavor ban measure for consumers to travel within the states beyond the bounds of that flavor ban to get their unflavored products. But I would say in those jurisdictions where we do have flavor bans, we see an nice attractive velocities and we're not seeing market declines in overall velocities affected by those regions."

And overall, we consider Nielsen to be in terms of market shares and therefore also segment market shares, the trends they're relatively reliable and despite what's going on. And the reason for that is that also that Nielsen data capture the border trade that well. So, there really you see that the value segment has remained relatively stable. We think it's fairly accurate.",

And then going forward as Tom highlighted, we are based on current trends, the capacity constraint for the remainder of the year and then we do everything we can to supply the market and we've been successful throughout the history and then driving efficiencies out to our factory and then we also support the U.S. market with a bit of production from Sweden. We can potentially do a little bit more of that in the second half compared to the first just based on some of the investments in Sweden coming onboard, but we\u2019re talking small incrementals."

What is encouraging with a flavor ban is that with what we've seen is this kind of transition to the non-flavor varieties and we are but for a handful of other competitors alone with having unflavored varieties at our disposal.

So, if you look into for example when we first received our PMTA for general snus already then they were very explicit on the relative risk for general snus compared to cigarettes but you are not allowed to tell consumers.

And it's a good product and people don't stop consuming good products even in such very a bad time. So let\u2019s say are kind of directly hit by restrictions and so forth. And in terms of the mix on the consumer profiles and so forth, that's kind of at the detail level that we don't go into at this call.

In that regard, what I would say is when you look at our Q2 shipments, it was, the vast majority of what we shipped in Q2 was produced at our Owensboro facility. So, the extent of supplemental volumes that we source from our Swedish manufacturing site was somewhat limited. And I think Lars had mentioned obviously, that there does present opportunity for incremental levels of support has market demand and our established distribution base in the U.S. expands over the course of 2020. And that will give you a pretty good sense of our current manufacturing capacity.",

But I would look at that as kind of that future installation in Owensboro to be more of a benefit for 2021.

The store set for tobacco in the U.S., the 85,000, 90,000 stores is about the number of stores that we have shipments to for our Longhorn moist snuff brand. If you look at brands kind of more the market leading brands within moist snuff you have, they may be shipping to 150,000 stores, but really it's more closer to 125,000 is a pretty good number to use in terms of the universe of convenience stores that could be potential market for convenience.

I think you said and so the question is. So is there anything specific we should be thinking about in terms of 3Q? You've already highlighted that the situation in Scandinavia is eased a bit but not that much. Norwegians will find it very hard to buy in Sweden across the border. Are there any other such things we should be thinking about around your business that maybe distorted in Q3 because of the virus?"

I mean we have pipe, the pipeline, whether it's stores receiving product for their first time, whether it stores receiving expanded varieties of product for their first time that's more challenging to understand the placement and reversal of that in market on a quarterly basis. So, I was talking more so specifically about the consumer level on hoarding."

So, it's really the shipment of those levels out to points of trade for sale growth, and those spiked quite markedly in and around the end of Q1. So, portly the reversal of the hoarding consequences that have yet to unwind is one element.",
            "We also talked about the challenges that we've had in our Dominican Republic facility on the, what was the closure and the phased reopening. We are not yet at kind of pre-COVID production levels. So, we will continue to see levels of increased costs and likely adverse elements of adverse mix shifts as we bring on kind of return to more normalized levels at our Dominican facility. And we expect to kind of get to pre-COVID levels by the end of Q3. Those are the two larger pieces.",
            "We talked also about this relationship of shipment volumes in Norway in Q2 versus what underlying Nielsen may otherwise suggest, with a view that a portion of our shipments into Norway in Q2 help to replenish what were depleted levels at the end of Q1. So, there could be some level of unwinding of that effect in Q3. That's kind of a view of the larger pieces. There likely could also be some headwinds within lighters in international markets, as well as even our Swedish distribution business, but those are kind of on the margin."

But as you did also in the end of 2019 and that was on a run rate of 20 million, I think on a quarterly basis and now you say a doubling as well, but now you're on a run rate of 25.

So, you get to some level whether the 25-ish million of production in our Owensboro facility is sustainable for all repeatable quarters. So, there was, I think we've talked historically about installed capacity of roughly or above 80 million cans, and that would be then doubled to greater than 160 million cans once the phase three implementation build is fully up and operational. But there are opportunities to kind of flex. And we are continuing as we become more familiar with the equipment of increasing and improving manufacturing efficiencies with that equipment."

            "I'd say that's not entirely realistic going forward, mainly in the very initial ramp up phase of the U.S. market. The Swedish factory were under extraordinary circumstances to out supply the market and in a manner that isn't sustainable over the longer term. So, that equipment does not have kind of an ongoing capacity of 15 million. And the capacity that is being installed now in the new equipment that is being stored and this just started to become operational in Sweden.",
            "That one is designed for producing the can for European markets, which defers from the U.S. market. It can of course with investments and so forth and the retooling of the equipment be altered and then serve as a back up or under extreme circumstances. But it's kind of more complicated than normal changeover. So one shouldn\u2019t kind of think of that as additional U.S. upside.",
            "Then I would say in that respect what Tom highlighted and that we've been very successful in our store in terms of utilizing the equipment that an operating efficiency level that exceeded a little bit our initial predictions based on this new technology, probably represent more of an potential upside opportunity than kind of any material support from Sweden."

Our market shares and you know broad numbers, but our market shares within the west specifically are mid-80s or so. And market shares for the balance of the U.S. are slightly less than 70%, and holding reasonably firm despite the aggressive promotional pricing activities that have been put in place by certain of our competitors."

We're continuing to see increases in velocities from those stores. So, we have not kind of hit the peak or the plateau even for our earliest installs."
