         "Welcome everyone, and thank you all for joining our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. First of all, I hope you're all healthy, safe and taking care of yourselves. There's a lot going on in the world today that requires our attention, so we appreciate you making the time for us. We're pleased to hold our annual stockholders meeting virtually as we aim to enable broad access and participation, especially in light of continued social distancing recommendations.",
         "I would now like to turn the meeting over to Sivan Whiteley, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, who will lead the formal business of the meeting and also act as secretary."

      "Mari Schwarzer": [
         "My name is Mari Schwarzer of NorthStar Asset Management, a socially responsible investment firm, based in Boston, representing 37,097 shares of Square common stock. Today, I am presenting proposal number four regarding employee representation on the Board of Directors.",
         "Never before in our lifetime have our company or employees faced such uncertainties or such a grim prospect for the future as posed by the current global pandemic. As our company works to navigate these unpredictable times, employees and their relationship to our company can be the guiding force that allows us not only to more safely but also stronger and more competitive. This shareholder proposal encourages the company to explore the ways in which non management employees could attain membership on the Board of Directors, because we believe that all employees are critical to our company's continued success and deserve a voice.",
         "We also believe that employees with a seat at the table are more likely to remain engaged and committed to the company. This time of crisis does not diminish the potential value of adding employees to the board. In fact, crises and transformative areas emphasize the potential value of fresh voices on the Board of Directors. Direct communication between employees and the board could offer significant efficiencies as our company and the economy seek innovative solutions to these unprecedented challenges. The existence of employees on U.S. corporate boards is not unheard of, several other publicly traded us companies have had or currently have workers on the Board of Directors.",
         "We believe that employees on the Board of Directors could help our company continue to thrive in several ways, such as more efficient communication of problems faced by employees and the creative solutions that those workers come up with. Faster alerts to potential pending crisis that could diminish our brand name, increased employee engagement and better retention, expression of employee assessments of managers, executives and workforce morale directly to the board and much more. Our employees are the driving force of our company. But is there trust and management falters due to disenfranchisement or missteps our company could suffer. To prevent this, we suggest allowing an encouraging representation on the board by non-management non-executive employees. We believe that employee representation on the board is a key way to ensure that employees are most crucial resource, remain fully engaged in the long-term growth of our company and help ensure operational excellence. We urge shareholders to vote for proposal number four."

These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. We will now pause for a moment to assemble the queue of questions.",
            "We will now take our only question, which is for our CEO, Jack Dorsey. Yesterday, a report describing Square Capitals processing it's payroll protection plan, PPP, applications was released and detailed that more than $820 million of PPP facilitated as of June 10, 2020. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the ongoing discussions related to social justice and equity, can the board comment on Square Capital\u2019s ongoing efforts to facilitate loans via PPP and other mechanisms, to small businesses run by individuals belonging to historically socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, black, brown and others?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you for the question. We're really proud of our speed and also our ability to partner with our sellers to make sure that they are getting access to the PPP program. We were one of the first to market to make sure that in the second rounds people had immediate and instant access but not only that, something that was understandable, accessible and they could readily utilize immediately to keep their business going. We do at Square and at Square Capital have a significant percentage of those who we serve represent underserved communities. Just some statistics on this 58% of our loans went to women on businesses, 35% of our loans to Square Capital went to minority owned businesses and 85% of Square fellows was outside the most populous U.S. cities.",
            "We're always looking for opportunities to partner with other organizations. Recently, we partnered with Diddy's, Our Fair Share organization, to make sure that black owned businesses were getting access to PPP funds as well. Really appreciate what Magic Johnson is doing in order to get black owned businesses access to these funds as well. So we're looking for, we continue to look for opportunities and continue to serve our purpose of economic empowerment, and that includes every seller but especially those who are most underserved and most marginalized."
