         "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Moelis & Company\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. On the phone today are Ken Moelis, Chairman and CEO; and Joe Simon, Chief Financial Officer.",
         "Before we begin, I would like to note that the remarks made on this call may contain certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those identified from time to time in the Risk Factors section of Moelis & Company\u2019s filings with the SEC and in our earnings release.",
         "Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated. The firm undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our comments today include references to certain adjusted financial measures. We believe these measures, when presented together with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to investors to compare our results across several periods and to better understand our operating results.",
         "A reconciliation of these adjusted financial measures with the relevant GAAP financial information and other information required by Reg G is provided in the firm\u2019s earnings release, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investors.moelis.com.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Ken to discuss our results. Ken?"
      ],
      "Joe Simon": [
         "Thanks, Ken. We earned second quarter revenues of $160 million, up 4% from the prior year period. We were able to shift resources quickly to meet the demands of our clients during the quarter. The extraordinary flexibility of our model is highlighted by the fact that over one-third of our revenues were awarded and executed during the second quarter. These revenues primarily came from a strong increase in our capital markets activity and a meaningful uptick in retainer fees, primarily related to restructuring mandates.",
         "Moving to expenses. Our first half 2020 comp ratio was accrued at 78%. We\u2019re managing the business for the long-term and believe that we have the right global footprint in place. And as Ken mentioned, we\u2019re adding exceptional talent, so that we maximize current opportunities and are best positioned to quickly strike when broader activity rebounds. Our non-compensation ratio was 17% for the second quarter of 2020 versus 23% in the prior year period, absolute non-comp expenses declined 22% versus the prior year, largely driven by a significant reduction in travel and other business development related expenses. As long as, general travel limitations remain in place non-compensation expenses should remain at or below $30 million per quarter.",
         "Moving to taxes. Our normalized corporate tax rate was approximately 25% this quarter. Our taxes reflect a benefit from the current quarters\u2019 operating results and a discrete benefit primarily related to the CARES Act. Regarding capital allocation, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.255 per share. We remain committed to returning all of our excess capital to shareholders. Most importantly, we continue to maintain a fortress balance sheet with substantial liquidity and no debt. We ended the quarter with $194 million of cash and liquid investments and an undrawn revolver.",
         "I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Ken."
      ],
      "Ken Moelis": [
         "Thanks Chett. Good afternoon, everyone. We are following the same strategy today that we did during the financial crisis, and that\u2019s investing in the business at a time of disruption and positioning ourselves for future growth. Our strong balance sheet with no debt, liquid financial position and collaborative culture has allowed us to attract and retain exceptional talent throughout this dislocation. We\u2019ve long discussed a few key areas that we believe would be important drivers of activity.",
         "Earlier this year, we strengthened our client coverage in the oil and gas sectors, deepened our financial sponsor relationship coverage and increased our capabilities and advising corporates on activist strategies. More recently, we announced the hiring of three additional Managing Directors and one Senior Advisor. One Managing Director based in Europe, advises clients in the healthcare sector, which we expect will be an area of innovation and transformation due to COVID-19 and following. We expanded the firm\u2019s capital markets capabilities with two Managing Directors based in the U.S. will be vital in growing that product offering. And lastly, one Senior Advisor is joined to provide access and advice to companies in the media and telecom sector, an already strong power alley to the firm.",
         "So far in 2020, we\u2019ve added 12 managing directors to our platform through external hires and internal promotions. And we will continue to be aggressive in recruiting the best talent for our platform. I know that we have the right talent strategy, capital structure and management team to navigate the current uncertain environment, be very active in the short-term, but also build earnings power over the long-term.",
         "I\u2019ll now pass it to Joe who\u2019ll walk you through our financial results. And then I\u2019ll conclude with a few final thoughts on the environment and the business. Joe?",
         "Thanks, Joe. M&A is picking up and there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for high quality assets across both corporate clients and sponsors. Corporates are reevaluating their business models. And I think we could see waves of significant strategic consolidation activity coming. Sponsors have substantial funds to deploy as well as assets, they need to monetize it. And with the continued stability in markets, they will be active. For some highly leveraged companies, the recent liquidity issues were morphed into a solvency crisis. In these cases, our leading restructuring franchise will continue to win new assignments and be strong contributor revenues over the long-term.",
         "And perhaps most interestingly, during the quarter Moelis & Company advise on 14 capital raising transactions placing nearly $14 billion in capital across both equity and debt. We achieve this without the overhead of sales, research and trading platform. And in a disruptive environment like the one we were in today, we see a unique opportunity for our firm as companies favor the speed and discretion of our asset-light independent model.",
         "In conclusion, Moelis & Company is responding even better than we could have imagined during the early days of the pandemic. Our bankers are very busy and in fact, we have seen an increase in new business activity versus this time last year. As a result, I\u2019m confident about the firm\u2019s future growth outlook.",
         "And with that, let\u2019s open it up to questions."

            "Good afternoon. Ken, just following up on your comments just now. M&A is slowed, restructuring has picked up based on what you\u2019re seeing now and based on your knowledge of your pipeline. Is it fair to say that maybe 2Q is the bottom for Moelis revenue? Could it be 3Q does a weakness extend to 4Q, what are you seeing as sort of the outlook here for revenue versus the 2Q that we just saw and what are the factors that are going to determine if earnings further soften from 2Q levels or rebound in the quarters ahead?"

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks, Ken. So look, we\u2019ve tried in the most stable of markets. I have tried and succeeded. I hope in not giving guidance by the quarter. It\u2019s really just too tough. Like I haven\u2019t said a one-third of our revenue last quarter was awarded and executed within the quarter. So we don\u2019t, these are volatile, volatile times. I\u2019m going to give you this though, Ken. My sense is that the inactivity in the M&A market has definitely bottomed. I mean, I sent a very strong desire to participate in M&A. Especially for high quality assets, and then May start to get driven a lot by financial sponsor activity. But I thought it really started six, seven weeks ago, and then went on a slight pause as we had another biking COVID cases, which sort of made people, I\u2019d say stutter a little bit.",
            "But as of today, we see a tremendous interest. People are saying, look, we need to buy quality assets. We are going to buy them. And if we have to over equitize for a while, we don\u2019t mind, doing that, we want to own them for 10 years. We think the current environment is temporary. So I\u2019m pretty bullish on the amount of activity that we have and that we are accumulating a backlog, it\u2019s just too fragile environment. There are things that, like I said, this started six, seven weeks ago, and then a spike in cases in the South and West, which came out of the blue or let\u2019s put it this way, it was not easy to predict. So I\u2019m just not going to go quarters, Ken, because I think, there\u2019s some \u2013 there\u2019s also an election going on. So there\u2019s lots of things I have no control over. But I do want to say, I feel strongly that people are getting back to business."

         "Remarks": [
            "I think it\u2019s fair enough. And then maybe as a follow-up, how do you see the money center banks as competitors for fees as we look forward in M&A, and some would suggest the banks have strengthened their relationships with their corporate clients with loans and other banking services, lifelines in some cases, and that this will result in more allocations of the M&A fee wallet to the bigger banks. Do you think bolus or the boutiques broadly will have to share more on M&A fees with the banks going forward over the next, I don\u2019t know, year or a couple years, or is this sort of a thesis just complete garbage?"

      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I haven\u2019t heard to see this, but I don\u2019t buy it. Number one early on in this crisis, there were some severe tensions actually. I wouldn\u2019t call them a friendly were really severe tensions. We had a couple of clients that just couldn\u2019t believe what happened in their bed. And I\u2019m talking about, very early March, April till the fed opened up the spigot. But I can tell you that some \u2013 once you see a good friend of your show their teeth to you, I think, they have teeth forever. And that tone changed after the fed came around and all of a sudden money was available. So number one, or there may be some truly rescue financings that are on the hook, but those are few and far between, I think when the fed opens the spigot and there is just tremendous access to the bond market and finance. It\u2019s your privilege to lend to the company not because, your company is real. It\u2019s not the 2009 crisis, where people are desperate to get money. They\u2019re getting it, and they\u2019re getting it in the public markets. Some of the biggest loans right now are being made by what we call the shadow market, which has gotten fairly large. Some of the sponsors are actively competing on some fairly significant direct lending.",
            "And I continue to believe by the way that the middle market will run into significant trouble European banks in their credit quality, their capital ratios, this is not over, this is just starting, I think, in the real economy. Forget the S&P 500, even the Russell, there\u2019s 10 million small mom-and-pop companies in the United States. They are not thriving and they don\u2019t have access to this money. So the loan books against those assets, I think will continue to cause difficulties for some of the large banks. Now that\u2019s a long answer to, I really don\u2019t believe it. We raised $14 billion, some of it in common equity or some pretty significant companies. The fact is, I think we disintermediation \u2013 I think some of the large companies on some of their products. And we weren\u2019t really \u2013 that wasn\u2019t a strategic \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a strategic decision by us, we just have sitting there and could execute it. So if it may become a strategic initiative as we go forward."

            "Great. Hi Ken, hi, Joe. First question here, just love to get a little more perspective on the compensation strategy this year, obviously, big uptick in the second quarter on the comp ratio and just like think about whether something changed on the full year view competitively or just on the revenue outlook. And I also appreciate the back half environment is pretty uncertain at this moment, but are there any parameters for us to at least think about the relationship between revenues and compensation in some different scenarios?"

      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So that\u2019s a fair question. When we last spoke to you, I think it was the second week of April. And I truly had no clue. I think if you go back and play the tape, I think I said, we truly have no clue what\u2019s going to happen next. And it seemed pretty like there could be a dire outcome. So we didn\u2019t accrue much bonus because we didn\u2019t know whether would be a business? I mean, I assume there\u2019d be a business, but I mean a healthy business. By the second quarter and this quarter, we feel pretty optimistic. This is \u2013 and I want to make sure, this is accrual for the first half of the year, what we now see as the run rate. We \u2013 it\u2019s almost \u2013 it\u2019s really a bullish statement that, hey, we do think that there\u2019s money and we\u2019re going to have to pay a bonus pool.",
            "In the first quarter, we weren\u2019t sure. As to what the run rate of the businesses would be in an environment where everybody was locked in their homes, it\u2019s almost there\u2019s a catch up. The second quarter is a catch up, puts us on a run rate for the first half, which reflects the first half, what we see for the first half. I\u2019m going to try. Because I have a feeling 10 people ask me this question. So I\u2019m going to try to lay this out. We don\u2019t see this year as a year of ratios. So I\u2019m not going to answer this year. It\u2019s a COVID year. This is a year I want to get to December 31, whatever bonus payment date is. And what I want to have is a strong balance sheet, the great client set, I want to retain our talent and I want to grow.",
            "I want to grow. And as you noticed, we have been hiring people. And I don\u2019t think that the revenue run rate has anything to do with ratios. It\u2019s just, this is a black swan event that is happening and we\u2019re not going to live by a ratio to set ourselves up for 10 years of growth. This happened to us. We happen to be private in the last crisis. And I started by saying that. We took advantage of it because as a private company, we didn\u2019t have to think about that. And then we set ourselves up for 10 years of spectacular value creation from 2009 to 2019. That\u2019s what I see happening. And so I want to divide it into that period. If you\u2019re paying attention to my \u2013 for the ratios this year, I\u2019m really not. I\u2019m paying attention to quality of the franchise, quality of the client base, quality of the balance sheet. Then we\u2019ll have 10 years.",
            "And then after that, I do think we have a moment here, Devin, where we can a stepped function, grow the company, again. I continue to believe, life will be difficult for people who have bad balance sheets. And by the way too, to Ken\u2019s question, no matter how strong you say you are, if you\u2019re a major financial, you\u2019re levered 10 to one, we are leveraged zero. I still think we can take advantage of that and hire and significantly expand our footprint in what I think will continue to be a difficult environment. So we may run into an elevated comp ratio even post this year. But then after that, we will settle back in. And I think we can run the business as we did for the five to six years post that expansion period of 2009, which was the old comp ratio sub 60%, and get back to that model, but do it in a format that I hope is twice the size of the franchise that we had coming into this crisis."

         "Remarks": [
            "Great. I appreciate all the perspective there, Ken. And then maybe a follow-up just on some of your commentary on M&A recovering recently, I guess, I\u2019m just trying to dig in a little bit more there, and I guess whether you\u2019ve been surprised by the resumption in activity and engagement and really just is this normal kind, of course, of conversation where buyers and sellers are starting to kind of re-engage and move forward on an actual transaction where there\u2019s a reasonable probability of getting to an announcement. Or is this kind of like the stage before, actually, we\u2019re kind of doing the work meaning that, the backdrop is still pretty fragile. And so there needs to be a broader economic reopening and more confidence for prime. Many of these deals actually get to an announcement. I\u2019m just trying to think about what it means that engagements kind of even ahead of where it was last year?"

We\u2019re in the high quality, a lot of our flow businesses and high quality sizeable assets in sponsor land drives a lot of our middle market business. And they\u2019re higher quality. And we\u2019ve had calls where people were looking at them in March, and then we went on hold and people come up and say, we\u2019ve thought about it. We have to own that asset. If it\u2019s a good asset, we\u2019re going to underwrite it and we want to bid on it. And we\u2019re starting to see that there was a pause in March and April, but it\u2019s coming back and I think they\u2019re ready.",
            "It\u2019s not everything, but on quality assets that you\u2019d want to hold for 10 years, there are financial institutions, especially, and by the way, we\u2019re seeing sporadic corporate strategic. I think on the corporate strategic what\u2019s happened is, people really did have to take care of certain things like their own people. There was a lot of distraction, I mean, I shouldn\u2019t call it a distraction. I should call it focus on the health of their people worked from home. There were higher priorities than strategic M&A. But in the financial sponsor world, that is their basic business buying and selling companies and they\u2019re ready to go. And I believe that we will start to see high quality assets execute. And fairly, rapidly as people get concerned that they\u2019re missing the opportunity to have gotten the assets they wanted."

We\u2019re working on different answers, I think from companies on earnings calls and this earning season around kind of their views of the outlook, and some are talking about green shoots, some expect it could remain slow throughout the remainder of the year. And I\u2019m assuming it kind of depends on where you\u2019re focused to the M&A markets or not. Obviously, one thing, and there\u2019s a lot of nuance to different parts of the market geographies customer base, et cetera, I think, as you just mentioned so. Is that kind of the right way to think about it, that there are pockets of very active kind of buyers and sellers and there\u2019s areas that are probably going to remain slower for an extended period of time? Is that the right read?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, I think it\u2019s going to be different. I think right now, what we see is kind of sizable high quality assets in industries that are not directly COVID related, like travel and leisure. Our people will find a way, since, how do you do due diligence? Well, if you can buy $1 billion or $2 billion asset, you think that asset is extraordinary, I\u2019ve noticed people find a way it\u2019s an entrepreneurial world, not everybody\u2019s shutdown. People want to make money and they will find a way to get the diligence done. And those transactions are both large enough to attract the banking market. And they\u2019re large enough to attract financial institutions that have funds to put to work and they are going to do it. I have a good think, that\u2019s a good point, Devin. It might be the meat of the market might be in that very high-quality sponsor market right now. But I think corporates are starting to rev up and come back into it.",
            "Look, I think that\u2019s probably where it\u2019d be ended up, it\u2019ll be different industries and different size. And right now it\u2019s being led by quality assets first. People are almost calling us up and saying, remember the quality asset I want to bid on that. I like that process to start again. And I\u2019m willing to go back to where I was \u2013 in terms of\u2026"

In a case, talk about how the environment and maybe your thinking has evolved after the fed actions earlier this year. And do you think that some activity has come out for good or has it just adding more leverage in the system and maybe expanded the way of restructuring that you could have over the next couple of years?"

So a lot of the capital market stuff, not all of it by the way, but some of it was started out as restructuring and went to capital markets that I talked about. I do think it\u2019s restructuring and will continue \u2013 there is additional leverage in the system. I believe that most people, when they think of a recovery here, think of going back to \u2013 maybe revenues across are down 5%. I think a lot of people like right now, I would have been happy with that, after what I thought was going on. But remember a system that\u2019s levered to EBITDA, if revenues go down 5% or 10%, most companies were built to grow revenues, not to even have flat revenues. And if your revenues are down 5%, that might mean your operating income is down 20%."

But if the ultimate run rate of revenue is down 5%, 7%, 8%, because the economy is suffering, you\u2019ll end up in restructuring with more debt just later on. So I\u2019m very bullish that we could actually see. I think we could see both of these. I\u2019ve never had it in 40 years. I\u2019ve always \u2013 it\u2019s always been talked about like, could you have both businesses go at the same time. In 2008, 2009 now there was no M&A, it was all restructuring and then M&A came back in 2010, 2011. I think M&A is going to come back, I 100% feel that. And I don\u2019t see how we don\u2019t have a very long and protracted restructuring cycle as well. So I think both could hit."

I mean you sound a lot more optimistic on the M&A side and as restructuring continues for maybe one, two years, it looks like you have a better line of sight into 2021. So is there an update on how you\u2019re thinking about dividends? Is it still more congestive to take it on a quarter-by-quarter basis? Or do you think you can opt to the level of dividend maybe in a quarter or two?"

I just like to try and put a finer point on the trajectory of the comp expense, not necessarily the ratio here. We don\u2019t know how the back half will play out, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably fair to expect that this year could be a softer revenue environment. So that intuitively could imply a lower comp dollar for the full year. So relative to last year\u2019s $470 million number, is it fair to expect that it could be lower? Or what are some of the puts and takes that I\u2019m not really considering there. Thanks."

And it\u2019s not just because of our backlog. We have good backlog. I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen. I don\u2019t know what happens with the election, what happens with the fed, what happens with the virus. And so I\u2019m being conservative on it and the answer is, yes, I do think it could be less. And that\u2019s why in the first quarter, I reflected that in our accrual, I just felt like, hey, I didn\u2019t know where the business was going and we were prepared to pay less. I think you should take it by our accrual this quarter that I actually think we are very confident in our business model.",
            "And so we see the probability that we\u2019re going to pay a bonus pool, and we\u2019re going to pay people to be here. And because \u2013 and this is the last point, and I know somebody had asked this question privately, who comes first, the employees or the stockholders. The stockholders come first. Every decision we make is for the stockholders, but you would not like Moelis & Company without its employees and without its talent and without people working hard and knowing that they\u2019re motivated. So we\u2019ve kept a great set of talent. We have hired tremendous people in the downturn. We are continuing \u2013 we want to do that, we want to be even more aggressive. This crisis has not made as much talent available because it didn\u2019t hit the financial institutions first.",
            "The 2008 crisis first hit financials and secondarily hit mom and pop enterprises. My feeling is, this is first hitting smaller enterprises. It will hit the big financials over time. And so we\u2019ve got to be patient, but we think there\u2019s going to be an opportunity to significantly expand our talent base at the right time in the cycle and are excited by that opportunity. So I don\u2019t know if that answers your question. But the best thing I can say is, if this year\u2019s comp ratio is the reason you\u2019re owning our stock, that\u2019s a bad reason to own it."

But I do think loan books will deteriorate our restructuring backlog. Is there future reserves? And if, I think you\u2019ve heard from all the boutiques, they think their restructuring cycle\u2019s going to be large, that comes out of somebody\u2019s lending book. And I think that is an opportunity and it will be there.

And I don\u2019t know exactly what the year looks like. And then, you talked about 2021. I want to say this, I expect elevated 2021, because I expect us to hire more people then we have, since \u2013 I\u2019m not going to pick a date, but since the tail end of the last crisis. I want to be \u2013 I want to prepare people. We\u2019d like to and we don\u2019t want to do it through M&A, which we get to put an asset on the balance sheet. We do it transparent and clean and we do it as hires and it goes through our income statement.",

By the way, we\u2019ve done all of our personnel management, including reducing personnel when we do it without special charges. We do it \u2013 just do it right through the income statement on a clear transparent way. And so when you say elevated 2021, you\u2019ll probably be able to tell that by our hiring, if we continue to grow, it\u2019ll be elevated because we\u2019re going to try to make an abnormal \u2013 we\u2019re going to try to grow abnormally fast. We\u2019re hoping to do that.",
            "Over the long haul, if you want to model the business on a long haul basis, I do think that when we get like last crisis, when we got to 2020, we ran the model at high 50\u2019s comp ratio pretty consistently every single year from 2014 to 2018, right to the end of 2019. And I think we can get back to that once we level off from what I hope and what I think will be a unique opportunity to double the size of the franchise.

Maybe adjust the size of the deferrals, maybe change around some of the composition. Or is that too dramatic a change for to be considered at this point?"

We\u2019ve retained our workforce. There is significant hooks into the firm from our workforce. So I can plan on our team being here. It\u2019s very valuable. They become owners of the company and I like it. And I think it aligns our interest in the length of service. Our length of service, I think is exceptional low volatility turnover.",

But look, last year \u2013 for the first, we went public in 2014 and we had one year of difficult revenue and it led to an elevated comp ratio. By the way, comp ratio that was elevated, but not even above, I think what some of our peers run day in and day out. So I \u2013 that was \u2013 I think we can get back, grow the company, accelerate our growth in the short-term and then get back to what we did for five straight years, which was pretty effective.
