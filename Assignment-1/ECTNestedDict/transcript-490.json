         "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. At this time note that all lines are in a listen-only mode, but following the presentations we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Also note that the call is recorded Wednesday, August 12, 2020.",

      "Rod Baker": [
         "Thank you, Terrance, good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. The second quarter continued to be very challenging for us as our full complements of gaming operations and ancillary amenities remain closed for the entire period due to the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. While we have taken actions to significantly reduce our operating expenses during the closure period, our second quarter results were negatively impacted materially by the closures, resulting in a decrease in revenues, expenses, adjusted EBITDA and cash flows when compared to the same period in the prior year. During the period, the company took measures to significantly reduce its operating expenses to mitigate the decline in revenues in the gaming facility closures.",
         "Human resource expenses in the second quarter, primarily consisted of costs related to remaining personnel required to support the business during the closure period. For the second quarter of 2020, approximately half of the property, marketing and administration expenses were related to direct property operating costs, including property taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance, with the remaining half related to administration costs, including licenses, subscriptions and professional fees.",
         "Great Canadian\u2019s revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 were $62.8 million and $31.8 million, respectively. Revenues for the second quarter of 2020 primarily consisted of the Ontario bundles\u2019 annual entitlement of service provider fees for permitted capital expenditures recognized in full in the second quarter and continued contractual service provider base fixed fees under the respective casino operating agreements, which resulted in a positive adjusted EBITDA.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA was also positively impacted by $20.9 million in lease payments which are no longer recognized as operating expenses in adjusted EBITDA due to the implementation of IFRS 16, the new lease accounting standard adopted in the prior year. During the second quarter of 2020, the company also recognized negative cash flows, which I will now discuss in more detail. As a result of the temporary suspension of operations, we have placed more focus on monitoring our free cash flow, an additional non-IFRS measure, which has been disclosed in our second quarter results.",
         "We believe free cash flow is a relevant measure to assess the company\u2019s performance during the closure period, particularly to understand the company\u2019s non-discretionary cash requirements. In the second quarter of 2020, the company had negative free cash of $123.4 million, which was consisted of adjusted EBITDA of $31.8 million as previously discussed, less changes in non-cash working capital of $22.2 million, capital expenditures of $98.6 million, substantially all of which was in Ontario, payment of lease liabilities of $20.9 million, and interest paid of $13.5 million.",
         "We funded the $123.4 million of negative free cash flow by borrowing an additional $60.7 million on their credit facilities for capital expenditures in Ontario and the remainder from available cash balances. Furthermore, prior to the end of the first quarter of 2020, we borrowed $325 million on the revolving portion of the senior secured credit facilities to ensure we had sufficient liquidity available. At the understanding of our circumstances was enhanced, we felt it was appropriate to repay these additional borrowings during the second quarter of 2020. Shareholders\u2019 net loss from continuing operations was $31.4 million in the second quarter of 2020, due to the previously mentioned facility closures.",
         "I\u2019m now going to provide an update on the company\u2019s outlook. Since the closure of all of our properties across the country, almost five months ago, we started to develop comprehensive reopening plans with the health and safety of our team members and guests as the foundation. As part of the planning process, we work closely with key stakeholders, including our Crown corporations and regulators to ensure our plans properly address provincial health authorities\u2019 guidance and recommendations as provincial economies reopen.",
         "Certain provinces have now approved casinos to reopen as part of their phase reopening plans. And we are working diligently on determining the reopening timelines and dates as we complete the necessary health and safety enhancements outlined in our plans. Since the temporary closures took effect, we have ensured that each of our operating agreements remain in good standing with our Provincial Crown corporations. Once we reopen, we expect our businesses will slowly recover, with the pace of recovery governed by our guests as they adjust to the new environment and gain confidence with our safety measures.",
         "In addition, we expect limitations on guest capacity and ancillary amenities to be in place for an extended period of time. However, as confidence levels increase, capacity restrictions easing, and patrons becoming more familiar with the new guest experience, we expect the business will further recover. Following the Government of Ontario\u2019s lifting of restrictions on non-critical construction projects starting May 19, 2020, we have restarted certain key capital projects in Ontario with appropriate workplace safety measures in place. We continue to reassess the impact to the timelines for the completion of these projects, in particular, the developments at Pickering Casino Resort and Casino Woodbine.",
         "As communicated in last quarter\u2019s call, during the second quarter of 2020, we worked with our banking partners to complete amendments to each of our credit agreements to temporarily waive certain financial and other covenants. As at June 30, 2020, Great Canadian continued to remain in stable capital and liquidity position with a cash balance of $498.2 million and $1 million \u2013 sorry, $1.160 billion of available undrawn credit on our credit facilities, subject to applicable covenants and the ongoing support from our banks.",
         "This was a challenging quarter for Great Canadian as it has been for many other businesses in our country, and we expect to be on a slow path to recovery when we reopen our gaming facilities. As our sites reopen, we will gain a better understanding of our financial outlook while finding opportunities to safely improve our business performance. I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support, as well as our Great Canadian team members for their hard work during these unprecedented times.",
         "As a final and very important comment, I want to thank all of our team members that unfortunately have been temporary left without work due to the closure, for their patience, perseverance and understanding. I look forward to welcoming you back soon.",
         "Terrance, you can now invite questions. Thank you."

            "Maybe hopefully, looking ahead to the reopening here, it looks like it\u2019s varied by jurisdiction. But can you maybe tell us your view in terms of which one \u2013 which jurisdictions were the closest to opening? And are we leading towards maybe a more of a 50% capacity reopen, similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the U.S.?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "George Doumet"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So that\u2019s a very, very challenging question to answer, George. So I\u2019m going to mention a few items. And then I think it\u2019s up to you and everyone to try and triangulate their own best view of the future. The first thing I would say is as much as we\u2019ve made significant progress in all of our jurisdictions, until we get to that all defining moment where it\u2019s a confirmed go, that means that it could be timing on any particular ability to move forward could vary materially depending not only on the microenvironment dealing with us, but also the more macroenvironment that our communities are expecting.",
            "So I think it\u2019s very difficult and challenging, even as we\u2019ve made good progress and move things along to leave you with any sense as to what we believe the timing will actually be. And I am hopeful, at some point, we will be able to surprise you with announcements that we will be opening up at some point in time. And as I\u2019ve messaged in the last call, once we have visibility on that, we will have a several week period to get the businesses organized again with our team members and protocols in place and that like.",
            "So I think it\u2019s very important that you understand that. And even if I was to give you a sense on a jurisdiction that I thought was in a better place as we were getting closer, I could mislead you because things could change here. So I think that\u2019s the overriding belief that I need to leave with you firstly. I also think it\u2019s very important that you look at provinces and what they have announced so far in terms of general business, opening requirements from a health and safety perspective. And that\u2019s going to be a key driver in terms of our ability to also open in a safe and appropriate fashion as businesses in the communities.",
            "And along those lines, there\u2019s been some visibility that you can look to broadly. And I would encourage you to do that in all four jurisdictions. You did mention about a 50% capacity."
         ],
         "Speaker": "Rod Baker"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes."
         ],
         "Speaker": "George Doumet"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And I think you also referred to some other markets in some U.S. markets. And I know lots of people have been trying to glean learnings from many different jurisdictions. And I think there\u2019s \u2013 in the same number of very short-term data points that will fall on a continuum that, frankly, I think will be much more misleading than helpful if you look at an Ontario B.C., Nova Scotia, New Brunswick opening profile. I think if you look at \u2013 and again, this is now Rod Baker personally versus corporately, I think Canada, by and large, has done \u2013 and the jurisdictions before that I mentioned there have done an exceedingly thoughtful job at containing a very difficult health situation. And I do believe there is a strong, strong priority to continue with the right type of reopening program broadly, which we fully, fully support.",
            " I mean, as you know, George, we\u2019ve always been in the marathon business and may be criticized for it between robust capital structure, lots of liquidity, things like making sure we invested for many years in Ontario to be successful through their modernization program, to having multiyear, multibillion dollar capital programs in Ontario, we\u2019re all about marathons not sprints. And I think COVID has really hurt businesses that acted like a sprint business, when they were now told, okay now, but now it\u2019s a marathon, and you\u2019ve sort of blown your wad in the short amount of time.",
            "So I think there\u2019s things going on in many markets that are very dissimilar and would be very misleading from, I think, the very sound and thoughtful political and health leadership that is being exhibited in Canada, which we fully support. And we don\u2019t want things to get out of hand such that then business needs to be clamped down. And so some of these other jurisdictions, and I won\u2019t mention any in particular, but again, to exercise some significant caution, a lot of them talk about things like capacity and many of them have talked about fire code capacity, and it sounds good and safe, but the reality is, when the market has said, we\u2019re at half capacity, it\u2019s actually a filled up zoo, and they\u2019re using almost all their machines and they are lining people in.",
            "And if you see some of these communities that I might be referring to south of the border, they\u2019ve got some very significant health challenges that are going on right now. And I think the governments up here are, thankfully, in our view, not on that program, and will serve us well when we open. So I think anything along the lines of 50% capacity, the way they\u2019ve done it, it\u2019s not really 50%. And I think for us, again, no crystal ball, that\u2019s a much, much, much too optimistic/reckless early days opening for our facilities, in my view, sitting here today, looking at everything that we know.",
            "So when we talk about \u2013 and I know we\u2019ve been criticized for being overly conservative in the past. I do believe this is a marathon, not a sprint. We need to get back in the game and to get back in the game, in a very safe and appropriate fashion and to reengage not only with our guests, but our team members with our new operating environment and make sure we do an exceptional execution of the guest experience, which will be extremely curtailed and limited in the early weeks and months. But also from a health and safety perspective, make sure we do have all these communities. So it\u2019s a very long answer, but I think people need to get off this thing of 50% fire code capacity.",
            "And I think the other thing it\u2019s worth mentioning, which, again, things can be different. And absolutely, I think even within our own business, it\u2019s different facilities will open differently with different levels of guest acceptance and traction. When you look at some of the early days stuff out of some of these markets, and I need to take people back to the regional business, which has been around for a long time, certainly longer \u2013 much before COVID, and it\u2019s been built out over the last 15 \u2013 10, 15 years, there was very little organic growth in many of these U.S. markets, particularly as states would increase capacity, it was very difficult.",
            "And now all of a sudden, with markets closed for several months, arguably some pent-up demand and then the first facilities opening so that you had instead of eight guys open on the four corners, you have two guys open in the first week and then a phasing of that and less amenities, you had some very decent results percolating out of some management teams in some facilities, which I\u2019m not saying the business was not there. But I think people are forgetting that as you look a little bit down the road, when all the capacity is online and everybody decides that they\u2019d like to go and try and reach for that extra GGR dollar in these markets, the market hasn\u2019t grown.",
            "If anything, if you look at the economic impact of COVID, it\u2019s going to be challenging for our business, it\u2019s a discretionary or business just like others. So I think there\u2019s some early days, almost euphoric sentiment out there, which I think the math does prove out, but I think you need to look beyond that to understand what it means over the short, medium and longer-term, and to not let yourself extrapolate out something very early and thinking that, that goodness continues and multiplies.",
            "So again, I don\u2019t want to tell you guys how to value things or look at things. I\u2019m all about running our business for shareholders. And we\u2019re setting it up to run it in a very thoughtful and appropriate fashion, being supported by our Crown agencies and regulators, and we\u2019re excited for that data come, but we\u2019re not there yet."

         "Remarks": [
            "Rod, you gave some pretty good granularity on the PMA cost this quarter. And I remember last conference call, you did talk about heavy financial burden of reopening. Can you maybe tell us a little bit about the cost structure, how that looks like in a reopen scenario?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "George Doumet"
      },
      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So I think it\u2019s too early to go through that. As I mentioned, we\u2019re \u2013 we have \u2013 it\u2019s going to cost more on a per unit of gaming dollar basis for sure, or we\u2019re going to have less gaming dollars. So and I think different facilities are going to be quite different, as you know. We have very modest-sized community type facilities, very limited amenities with much more straight forward flows of traffic on a state basis, then we\u2019ve got some that are much more complicated that require much more support.",
            "So there\u2019s a broad range. And I think at this point in time, it would be difficult for me to let you know what the cost side of our math would be once we reopen. As I think you noticed, I think the team has done an exceptional job while we\u2019ve been closed at mitigating the stranded costs, albeit at a very, very significant and terrible impact on many of our team members. That being said, we need to keep our business solvent so that we can invite everybody back and get everybody back to working properly here. So it\u2019s been difficult, but I think we\u2019ve done a good job. There\u2019s no question when we open, our cost structure is going to go up materially from that, which it has been while we\u2019ve been closed."

      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just one last one before I pass the line. I saw $6 million of wage subsidies in the quarter like, how do you expect that to trend in the back half? And the second part of that question is, do we get any form of aid at all from the Crown corporations?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "George Doumet"
      },
      "13": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So that\u2019s just formulaic on if you have eligible employee costs, and I would leave it to you because I think it\u2019s dynamic and changing every day in terms of the government, how they\u2019ve been supporting businesses and some of the metrics. So I actually think if we talk too much about it now, tomorrow, when there\u2019s been additional items or tweaks made to the planning, that could make things be more relevant or less relevant for us, going forward. So I think I\u2019d like to leave that for you, just to do your own homework, but as you can see, you mentioned there\u2019s a ratio of the amount of cost that we incurred in relation to that.",
            "So I think you can use that as a ratio looking backward. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily use it for a ratio going forward. But we are very much appreciative of that support. It\u2019s enabled us to mitigate our losses and to have more people back to work on things to get us back up and running sooner as opposed to later, so that we can reintroduce our thousands of other team members that unfortunately are not able to work right now.",
            "So I think it\u2019s a great initiative that\u2019s helped us get through this period for sure. In terms of the other Crowns, they\u2019ve been massively success \u2013 or supportive in all respects. I think financial is one of it, working with us together. We are trying to figure this out. It\u2019s still a very fluid situation, and it\u2019s being figured out on a daily basis. They understand how important it is for us to open, but to open in a safe and responsible fashion as do we. And so I think that process is going well.",
            "In terms of financial support through this period, I think you\u2019ve seen contractually, what we\u2019ve looked in terms of other financial support through this period, that hasn\u2019t been a necessity or a requirement as we\u2019ve obviously funded our closure costs off our own balance sheet, which we\u2019re more than fine with, don\u2019t get me wrong. So I think that\u2019s more than appropriate. And forward-looking in terms of making sure we can get business in a fashion that is stable and safe from a health and safety perspective, but that also is possible from a financial perspective, is critically important for us. And those are the things we\u2019re working on right now."

But I guess, if you look at it from your perspective, apart from the government guidelines on when you can reopen, do you have sort of capacity thresholds or certain metrics that you can share that you would like to see before you reopen? Obviously, there\u2019s breakeven revenue amounts. But in Ontario, for example, has got 50-people limits in some places. How are you thinking about it? Like what would you like to see?"

         "Remarks": [
            "I mean, so right now, there are 50-people limits in Ontario, that is factually correct. And that\u2019s why I was encouraging everybody to look at the four jurisdictions to see what is out there. And so that is what\u2019s out there. And so that\u2019s the current environment that we\u2019re dealing with. I am aware that the government has looked at the cinema business, for example, and I think they\u2019ve approached it a little bit differently. But again, I would encourage people to go and look at that as opposed to me trying to paraphrase something that I\u2019m not an expert with and to get it wrong.",
            "So I think the \u2013 it\u2019s a very different situation there out in D.C. If you look at the health authorities and the restrictions placed on large gathering. So I think this is still very fluid for us. And so it\u2019s very difficult for me to go and tell you how I think it play out. I would \u2013 if it\u2019s not clear enough, I think it\u2019s extremely thoughtful good business to open in a very sound and very manageable perspective and get in the game in a safe and appropriate way, and deliver a very good guest experience even if it\u2019s a very different guest experience, and early weeks and months.",
            "I think that is absolutely in our best interest. I know stock markets and shareholders would like things to happen today. I need to look further than that. I think \u2013 and I\u2019ll just be totally honest, we\u2019re in the casino business here and we are not going to make people get sick. I think that would be a very, very bad thing for us. And if we have to start more modestly because it\u2019s very much \u2013 it\u2019s very safe and appropriate. And that\u2019s what\u2019s not only our view, but our crown organizations and our regulators. And that\u2019s what we want to do, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re happy to do.",
            "And to be honest, baby steps when you open up with new protocols or baby steps is actually a smart, good thing. And then as you go and you see that things are working well, then maybe there\u2019s an opportunity in dealing with regulators and crown corporations and indirectly, health authorities, to how things evolve on a more expanded basis. So I think people need to understand that this is \u2013 I call it a marathon, it sounds bad. This is a journey. We\u2019re on a journey. And this is a very important journey, and it\u2019s very important that we set it up right at the beginning for success.",
            "So I think our business levels are going to be very modest in the early days, I really do. And we support that concept. And we don\u2019t \u2013 I think it\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t lead a lot of dollars every day. I think that gets very expensive. And so we need to mitigate that, but we\u2019re not going to mitigate that at opening up the doors and creating an environment that\u2019s not contained and control and are appropriate from a health and safety perspective.",
            "So we\u2019re going to try and get the balance right. And if we err on the side, we\u2019re going to err on the side of a little slower, a little more thoughtfully, a little more controlled, so that we really make sure we do a very good job here in these respects. And I think our \u2013 not only our business deserves that and will be rewarded by that, I think, our communities and our people that work within and come to visit us, they deserve that as well. So that\u2019s our operating approach."

Or would you like to open all your facilities at the same time? It seems like the East Coast is a little bit ahead of other provinces. So is it sort of a province by province decision?"

But my preference would be, it all open at once. I think that would be really great. I think the reality of the situation is \u2013 that\u2019s probably not going to be the case here. So everything is being worked on a siloed basis, but with common resources and best practices so that we can really deliver up the right protocols and execution paths for each of the regions. But I would expect there to be some differencing in timing of \u2013 reopening timing between the different jurisdictions.",

So \u2013 but I think those could be more micro in nature than a province-by-province, which is binary, right? Either you can open or you can\u2019t kind of thing. So yes, I think it will be \u2013 it probably would just evolve to being a staging, but there\u2019s some chance it might not."

Can you give us your thought process of the factors you\u2019re considering? Is it managing your cash flow during the closures? Is it potential increases in some of these construction costs? Just how are you thinking about that?"

      },
      "24": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So that\u2019s a great question. And if you noticed, I spend a lot of time on free cash flow, and we even spend a lot of time and creating something new in this closure period, so that you guys understood it and you understood our thinking on this. There\u2019s no question that in this period, if we are not in business and generating free cash flow, free cash flow for us has been critically important for two reasons, other than showing probability and progress in our business, it\u2019s done twofold. It\u2019s been significant capital that we\u2019ve directly redeployed against our Ontario significant capital programs, of which we are right in the middle of right now.",
            "And then it also provides the retained earnings equity component for the amount of capital development dollars that we borrow from the bank. So it\u2019s been a foundational piece of how we\u2019ve been able to \u2013 five very significant sized assets, have a multibillion-dollar development program underway while we haven\u2019t gone and issued a bunch of shares and done all sorts of other things to raise money to do that. So with our business not generating cash flow now and in fact, actually a negative operating cash flow amount. It\u2019s much more critical through this period that we look at cash in and cash outflow.",
            "And I didn\u2019t want you guys to get too giddy about $30 million of EBITDA either through this closed period, which is really, I think, an outstanding number, and we\u2019re happy with. But you need to understand what that number is made up of. And as we \u2013 as I mentioned, if it wasn\u2019t picked up, IFRS 16, we have $20.9 million of cash lease costs in Q2 that we paid and had to pay, that no longer show up in our EBITDA line, which, when we have a regular amount of EBITDA and this is like 10% to 15% of our EBITDA, then that\u2019s fine. But in this quarter, it was 66% of its EBITDA number, and it\u2019s a non-cash EBITDA.",
            "So right away, that\u2019s not there. And then obviously, as the business wound down, as I messaged the last call, when you\u2019re up and running regularly, you have working capital levels to see, they stabilized. But when business stops and you have \u2013 you run negative working capital balances, then they start to unwind that takes cash. So we had cash come up this quarter for that as well.",
            "And then we did benefit by our PCE this quarter, which as you know is once a year, and it\u2019s significant $24 million. We appreciate it. But even in this quarter alone, we spent $100 million of CapEx. So even in terms of the net of those two, even this quarter alone, we\u2019re still negative cash flow quite a bit. So it\u2019s critically important through this period for all of these reasons that we look at our cash and our cash liquidity and cash outflow situation.",
            "Now that being said, we are very excited about our prospects at Pickering and Woodbine, when the government allowed noncritical construction to resume, we\u2019ve resumed those projects. And we\u2019ve done that. I would tell you, at this point in time, even though we\u2019ve had delays and things will be delayed, we spent another $100 million this quarter. I don\u2019t think Q3 is going to be quite that high, but Q3 is still going to be a very, very significant capital development program, principally at Pickering, at Woodbine in Ontario.",
            "So that continues because we think that\u2019s an important part of our future. And as I mentioned, our marathon and our liquidity and our balance sheet over the years that we\u2019ve been somewhat criticized for, I think this is a real proof positive that it served us well because it\u2019s affording us more ability to continue with these very significant and critically important capital programs through what\u2019s an incredibly difficult closure period for us right now.",
            "So you\u2019re spot on in that, so we think of it. Now from a timing of where we have bulges in the capital program and how we\u2019re lining up to actually open both Pickering, which is was coming up to the short-term opening potential at the end of Q1, very early Q2. And then Woodbine a little bit further down the road. We need to be thoughtful on when we\u2019re going to bring those properties online.",
            "So we\u2019re continuing the capital program to create the optionality of when we\u2019re going to actually open those two facilities, Pickering being obviously much sooner on the timeline, but at this stage of the game until we have a much better understanding of opening and traction, and then how health and safety protocols might change over time to enable us to have a larger gaming experience and a more amenity gaming experience in a safe and appropriate way.",
            "Without understanding those metrics and the potential behind those, it would be reckless to pretend that I know when we should open up these new big facilities that are very exciting and will be fantastic. But they also remember, come with a whole bunch of new fixed operating costs when you open those. So we need to make sure that to the business the environment is there to support those. So we have the ability and we are continuing along. And as I mentioned, Q3 is going to be a very, very significant capital expenditure period for us as well. But you shouldn\u2019t extrapolate from that we\u2019re going to open Pickering in six weeks from now, because we\u2019re not going to do that."

So I would do that and then obviously as we\u2019re all very clear the PCE is a Q2 only event that happens once a year in Q2. So if I would back that out, I also think it\u2019s a little bit difficult to say, but as I mentioned when you first close the business, how there\u2019s the unwinding of negative working capital. So I think our working capital profile in Q3 won\u2019t be quite as punitive as it was in Q2.",

So I think you should use all of the same numbers that you now have in Q2 and think about those three important line items and adjust for those and you\u2019re probably doing not too badly then."

So I think at this point in time, with so many unknowns in terms of not only the timing, but the traction environment and the math that\u2019s going to flow out of that, I think at this point it\u2019s premature to look at those kinds of items with any degree of confidence to see how much that needs to be focused on at this stage or not.",
            "I mean, I think it\u2019s \u2013 look, the reality is when we get back in business and we\u2019re starting to rebuild our business, I think that is a very important milestone, irrespective of the math that falls out of it and that\u2019s the first place to start, and then you take it up from there. But again, I think between now and even through the end of Q1 2021, there\u2019s a lot \u2013 it\u2019s a short amount of time, but there\u2019s a lot of ground to cover not only in terms of our business operations, but as I mentioned, what\u2019s going on out in our communities.

And I think even Q4, as I mentioned, in terms of the time line and if you look at Pickering, I think even though it\u2019s not too far away, we need to reassess how much gas we put on things or not, depending on when we open, how that goes, what our protocols are, what our capacity picture looks like. So I think there\u2019s many, many items that are going to \u2013 our team is very, very nimble and thoughtful, and we are going to have to be very dynamic about managing that, so that we frankly, sets those up for the best opportunities from a timing and a cost perspective with the capital programs.",

So it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s difficult stuff and it\u2019s big dollars and big assumptions. So we\u2019re working through that.

So I think the comment that you made \u2013 and that made it into the newspaper, and as we know the newspaper doesn\u2019t always get it right, and then people pick it up over and over and over again. I think it ended up actually being a little bit erroneous. And I do believe I was told \u2013 I didn\u2019t check it myself, I was told if you go back to the source document now on the B.C. Government\u2019s website, that you could see that it\u2019s been reformatted. So it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not interpreted in an incorrect fashion."

Can you maybe give us a quick update on where Pickering is right now? I think opening was expected in Q2. But I guess with that push out, are you now on to sort of the hotel and other amenities for the construction? Or are you still working on the main casino?"

            "So, everything went shovels down and then we\u2019ve reinstituted and we\u2019re working on it again. We still \u2013 as I mentioned, we\u2019re balancing the amount of cash outflow in this closed period versus inflow. So things have been stretched out a little bit. And also, obviously, you need a health and safety perspective. So we will maintain the ability to open the facility on six to eight weeks notice when we want to, and we\u2019re continuing to move it along, but we\u2019re not moving along so that we have the entire thing sitting there and the extra last dollars of CapEx sitting there, because they need to be funded in terms of the aggregate dollars and then the interest cost on it.",
            "So I think you\u2019re still going to see as to this one, as we open it, a phased opening. And I think you need to \u2013 and look, things can change, but I think if you look at the environment right now, things like a huge feeder and conference center, we\u2019re not opening those up in the first instance anytime soon now, right? So I think too many dollars in some of those very specific modules are not the best place to spend money at this point in time, wherein some others, like parking garages or whatnot, at Woodbine that type of thing where there\u2019s always been tracking challenges, that\u2019s a great thing in any respect.",
            "So I think I don\u2019t want to get into too many details on the nuances that our \u2013 how our team is approaching it, because I think they\u2019ve done a very thoughtful job, not only from a capital development perspective with time and options and flexibility, but also from a business perspective, putting dollars where we think we can open earlier and sooner and get some benefit from it. That\u2019s where we switched the \u2013 move the priority. Which it all needs to get done, but what you do in what order, if you have some flexibility, I think, can be and has been tweaked a little bit. But I think to get into more details than that right now, is going to bore a lot of people and not be a lot of value at this point in time."

So yes, that should be looked at differently than the PCE, which as a function of making significant capital investments in the past, our PCE pools \u2013 I\u2019m saying that in quotes \u2013 with OLG are so filled with CapEx dollars that as soon as we get to the first day, April 1st of their fiscal year, that\u2019s when the PCE is recognized and payable. So it is very different. And you could look at the one ratably overall four quarters wherein the PCE is one quarter only in Q2. Yes, that\u2019s correct."
