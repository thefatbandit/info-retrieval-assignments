         "Good morning and welcome to the ProPetro Holding Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, that this event is being recorded.",
         "I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Sam Sledge, Chief Strategy and Administrative Officer. Please go ahead, sir."
      ],
      "Phillip Gobe": [
         "Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with our overall results for the second quarter, given the unprecedented demand and supply disruptions the oil and gas industry face, primarily as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. On behalf of the entire ProPetro team, I want to thank all the first responders and medical professionals for their selfless and tireless efforts, ensuring the wellbeing for all of those who live and/or work in the Permian Basin.",
         "I continue to be amazed at our employees\u2019 collective resiliency, given the current environment. And I want to express my deep gratitude once again for their hard work and dedication. As always the health and safety of our employees, customers, supply chain partners and other stakeholders remain the top priority of the company. And we will continue to implement best practices according to CDC guidelines and other governmental agencies to ensure safe and efficient operations for the duration of the pandemic.",
         "During the second quarter, we saw activity levels decrease rapidly in April and May, as customers responded to a continued deterioration in market conditions that began in mid-March. As such, we took swift and decisive measures to help us proactively shrink the core of our operations, save costs through collaboration and focus on innovation, we considered critical to enable a recovery.",
         "In addition to safeguarding the long-term health of our balance sheet, another key tenant in our decision making process was ensuring we protected the core competencies of our business. These capabilities support ProPetro\u2019s clear reputation as an industry leader that provides its customers unmatched execution in an environment where its employees can flourish. As such, we took the necessary steps to streamline our operations without sacrificing our ability to respond quickly as market conditions improve, which we began to see in June. More specifically, our cost saving initiatives have included, rightsizing our workforce while maintaining our core talent, significantly reducing maintenance capital expenditures and field level consumables, negotiating lower pricing for expendable items, materials used in day to day operations and large component replacement parts, internalizing certain support functions that were previously outsourced and reducing compensation of all officers, executives and directors.",
         "Complementing these efforts, during the second quarter was continued operational and safety excellence in support of our customers\u2019 drive to stay as active and as profitable as possible. We are working closely with our customers to ensure our collective success remains at the core of our DNA. I want to thank the entire ProPetro team for weathering the storm to the most turbulent environment in our company\u2019s 15 year history.",
         "Finally, a significant highlight of the second quarter was completion of our previously announced audit committee internal review process and the filing of our 10-Q\u2019s for the second and third quarter of 2019 and our 10-K for 2019. With the filing of our 10-Q for the first quarter of 2020 on July 2, we became current with our filing obligations with the SEC. I want to thank all involved for their assistance over the last year. The successful completion of these activities allow us to fully focus our efforts on the future of our business in an environment of stronger processes and controls that enhance our competitiveness.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sam to discuss our financial performance. Sam?",
         "All right, Sam, thanks. While the backdrop for the oil and gas industry, both globally and in the U.S. has improved from the lows seen only a few months ago, activity levels remain historically low. In this environment, we will continue to leverage a blueprint for success that has guided us through the many cycles of our past 15 years, as a company.",
         "Our mantra has always been and still remains to take the long view. No matter where you are in the cycle, the key is to remain close \u2013 in close contact and squarely focused on the needs of your customer. This includes helping your customer solve their technical problems at the wellsite, providing them with unmatched execution, remaining disciplined with pricing and continually assessing your internal cost structure and capabilities.",
         "While it currently appears the worst is behind us. We are not relying on the substantial recovery in all demand to chart the future of our success. As in the past, we view our performance at the wellsite to be paramount. This will help drive improved fleet level returns without the necessity of increased pricing. Having said that, as Sam discussed, we will only execute projects with a positive returns that allow us to protect our capital structure, regardless of where we are in a particular cycle.",
         "Another contributor to our future success is a commitment to the continued evolution of pressure pumping technology that minimizes the environmental impact of operations through reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and other considerations, while at the same time promoting overall safety and wellsite throughput. And some, we continue to hold a strong belief that pressure pumping equipment must significantly evolve for our industry to remain competitive on a global scale.",
         "A clear example of our commitment is our substantial investment in the electric fleet technology of DuraStim. We are continuing to test and develop the technology by working alongside conventional equipment in the field to the company, ample time to collect data and various operating conditions. Although the development timeline has been longer than we initially expected, we along with our customers expect to redeploy the DuraStim equipment on a larger scale, when testing is complete.",
         "In conclusion, we anticipate and meaningful improvement in fleet utilizations for the third quarter, as compared to the second quarter. Having said that, we remain very selective in redeploying assets and crews, and we\u2019ll only proceed if projects meet our economic targets, most of which are likely to be with existing customers. Clearly, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and substantially dependent on the potential spread of COVID-19 and related impact on the global economy and discipline within OPEC plus.",
         "This backdrop does not change the focus that has served us well over many years and will continue to guide our success well into the future. This includes leveraging our Permian Basin focus and relationships with customers through best-in-class collaboration, ensuring we provide customers with innovative solutions that solve their problems with unrivaled execution at the wellsite, and proactively seeking additional ways to redeploy technology, to reduce duplication and streamline processes to foster innovation.",
         "Bottom line, we clearly understand the value of unmatched execution in the marketplace. Our customer focus remains clear regardless of market conditions, focus on fostering the long-term relationship, solve their problems and leverage an economic structure that benefits both parties.",
         "With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to the operator for questions. Nick?"

      "Sam Sledge": [
         "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation in today\u2019s call. With me today is Chief Executive Officer, Phillip Gobe; Chief Financial Officer, Darin Holderness; and Senior Vice President of Operations, Adam Mu\u00f1oz.",
         "Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings announcement for the second quarter of 2020. Please note that any comments we make on today\u2019s call regarding projections or our expectations, future events are forward-looking statements covered by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are subject to several risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. Also, during today\u2019s call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. Finally, after our prepared remarks, we will hold a question-and-answer session.",
         "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Phillip.",
         "Thanks, Phillip. We were pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter, given the unprecedented volatile environment. This includes generating free cash flow and positive adjusted EBITDA during the period, despite a 73% decrease in revenue from the first quarter. That said, I would like to point you to our press release and form 10-Q, which will be filed in the coming days for more detailed financial commentary concerning our quarterly and sequential results. As Phillip discussed, driving our success for the second quarter was our ability to balance the need for substantial cost reductions to immediately address the financial implications of the crisis without going so far as to negatively impact our competitive advantages in the marketplace.",
         "As important was our focus on protecting the health of our balance sheet and capital structure, which along with performance at the well site will be a key differentiator as customers determine who they will partner with as market conditions and activity levels continue to improve. As discussed in our press release, our second quarter revenues included $32.6 million of compensatory idle fees. These stems from a purchase of assets, which included contractual provisions with one of our largest customers and we\u2019re intended to supplement our financial health during times of depressed activity. We did exactly that during the second quarter, by using a portion of these fees to ensure we could retain the necessary talent and core competencies to support our operations until conditions began to improve in June.",
         "During the second quarter, we also paid off $110 million of debt and ended the period debt-free. As a result as of June 30, we had a net cash balance of $37.3 million, as compared to the $33.7 million at the end of the first quarter. Fast forward to July 31 and total cash was $22.6 million with no outstanding debt. Total liquidity as of July 31 was $43.1 million, including cash and $20.5 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. We would also know that the July 31 cash balance is not inclusive of approximately $32 million in idle fees that we expect to collect sometime in the third quarter.",
         "Based on accounts receivable, less customary reserves, our borrowing base is impacted by our customer\u2019s activity levels as well as certain customer concentrations. With the increase in activity levels, we have seen since June and expect to see through the remainder of the year, we expect to see growth in our borrowing capacity. Having said that, we view having no debt outstanding while the market recovers, as a significant competitive advantage and we remain committed to executing projects with positive returns that allow us to protect that capital structure.",
         "To support the expected continued increase in customer activity levels, we now have a view of total CapEx spending for the full year 2020 of less than $100 million, of which $54.7 million was spent during the first six months. The vast majority of capital spending for the full year will be for maintenance CapEx. We would also note that we expect virtually no spending on growth capital in the second half of this year.",
         "Finally, the steady improvement in customer activity, we have seen since June supports our current view of effective utilization between seven and eight fleets during the third quarter of 2020.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Phillip."

I\u2019m really asking because I\u2019m trying to assess where you think there\u2019s sufficient momentum here, especially at 4Q is up again on 3Q, even with the typical seasonality we see towards the end of the year?"

We obviously, as we quoted in the release averaged four quarters \u2013 four fleets, 4.0 fleets in the second quarter. The trough was below that, the exit was above that. That might be an obvious statement. But the same seems to be true about third quarter as well that our guide to the seven to eight fleets was that we came in the quarter below that, and we do expect to exit the quarter above the top end of that range."

And how should we think about the revenue per fleet trend via ex any fees in 3Q. And how does that translate to EBITDA per fleet in 3Q?"

We do the work that we\u2019re getting back to you right now is, as you said, high calorie work, this is all still multi-well pad, 24/7 work. So it\u2019s just kind of right back to the usual pace as what it seems."

Just to think about that as a starting point for the next quarter and/or how much we can expect in shortfall payments as we look to the third quarter, you guys framed kind of a back half arrange on your previous call. But just curious, what the outlook is there for the third quarter on the shortfall side?"

            "And George on the kind of the profitability point in second quarter not to state the obvious, but if a 100% of the idle fees were to fall into the bottom line, then you would have seen our EBITDA $32 million or more. That obviously didn\u2019t happen during the quarter. A mix of a few things but the main contributor, probably us bridging activity gap that not \u2013 that had we not known that activity was going to recover fairly quickly. And from May to June, we might have acted a little bit differently and you might\u2019ve seen a little bit more of those idle fees follow the bottom line. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll comment directly towards what fleet level profitability was in the second quarter, but I can say that we are turning down work that doesn\u2019t meet our economic goals. And those goals are obviously to produce enough EBITDA to cover maintenance CapEx in the near term, and therefore have a positive cash flow at the crew level."

            "Great. That\u2019s very helpful, Phillip and Sam. Think about the competitive landscape in the Permian, I guess, how would you describe that today, right? All these assets are on wheels. It seems like the Permian is where the activity is coming back is equipment rushing into the basin, keeping that fitting behavior very fierce, even as activity increases. Are you seeing guys have to exit and attrition occur? Just curious that view on the competitive landscape from boots on the ground perspective."

And I believe our customers see that as well. And we\u2019ve been fortunate enough to be able to continue to work with those blue-chip customers, as we bring on these fleets on for the remainder of the year. And those guys continue to value execution. They say for working performance and the dedication of our people out there in the field as well."

Although I will say, as you guys have probably heard there\u2019s everyone recognizes, this is a basin that\u2019s going to respond the fastest and at least on a couple of calls, I think I picked up that people have said that they may reallocate equipment to the basin, but we\u2019re not saying it. And unless they have a track record, I don\u2019t see them breaking in with the top tier customers that we operate for."

In times like these, I guess one could paint it as a disadvantage if equipment starts to flood into the Permian, but having the customer and supply chain relationships that we have here give us quite a few competitive advantages that others don\u2019t have it, not being as focused as we are."

Right now, maybe we\u2019ll see more of that attrition, but I\u2019m not sure I would expect to see a lot of consolidation or attrition happened prior to the end of the year.

So until, we reach a level of utilization across the sector, that\u2019s meaningfully higher than we\u2019re seeing today. I think that will remain a bit unknown. I also believe that all of our peers would echo that the threshold to reinvest in older equipment continues to go up as we continue to be demanded of us to have more efficient equipment cleaner burning fuels, lower emissions. There\u2019s obviously interest in the electric offering that reinvesting in existing older conventional equipment, the bar continues to migrate higher. So naturally, yes, we should see attrition due to that. And the other factors that Phillip outlined a little bit hard to say how much at this point, but we think given the disruption that the whole energy industry seen that it will produce quite a bit of attrition, say over the next year to two years."

I was wondering, if we could talk about the third quarter fees. It sounds like maybe there were some elevated costs in the second quarter that prohibited 100% of those fees to fall to the bottom line. Do we expect those costs to continue into the third quarter? Or can we expect to see those idle fees fall into the bottom line100% margin?"

There was quite a bit of noise in moving parts from an activity standpoint, as activity slid sharply at the beginning of second quarter and then rose in the back half of the quarter. And a lot of those costs were absorbed indirectly by the idle fees operating in more of a steady state and in almost a growth mode that we\u2019re very accustomed to. You should see more of the per dollar effect follow the bottom line that said, I\u2019ll just reiterate what Darin said earlier. We should be at the lower end of the range that we disclosed last quarter, probably looking at $12 million to $13 million in idle fees in the second half of this year, and pretty evenly dispersed between third quarter and fourth quarter."

And so I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be facing that same dilemma that we\u2019ve seen. Having said that, we still have Thanksgiving, we still have Christmas. So there is some seasonality involved. But I think my view, at least to the people I\u2019m talking with is I think the activity stay strong. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because operators have hedged their production out when they took the opportunity. So they know they can at least continue to operate in a profitable scenario for them. So at least to, I\u2019m talking to, I feel pretty confident unless we have a big hit on COVID spread that affects demand for OPEC coming off their reduction and starts putting more oil into the market, creates a crash. I see activity staying pretty steady and it may even stay pretty steady with those two criteria that I just laid out just because the productions hatched out, but that\u2019s at least a view that I take."

So I just want to make sure I understand that correctly. And then if we do the same thing for EBITDA, it\u2019ll put your EBITDA a little bit over $1 million on that adjusted basis. So again, just really want to get kind of a starting point to make sure I get that starting point, right? As we go into third quarter and kind of build on your commentary for improvement from there, it is? Am I understanding that dynamic correctly?"

So if you just take the seven to eight in the third quarter, multiply it by 75, that\u2019d be the total number of working days in the quarter.

I think right now it\u2019s hard to see the road to get there, especially from a time perspective.

The planning and the other services that they align around us, all of that has been going in the right direction over the last say, two years. We need to continue to see improvements there. I guess, I say all that to say is that we are not going to depend on pricing to get us there.

So I\u2019m a little more bullish maybe than Sam in that. I think that the high performing, high efficiency companies working for the blue chip top tier companies are going to see some improvement, because I think maybe they\u2019ll be less capacity in the market and a demand for higher performing companies. I like our position where we stand today with a protection on the downside with idle fees, if we swim down in our ability to perform at the highest levels on the upside.

I think but \u2013 or at least I\u2019m hearing several operators are very concerned because they\u2019re feeling like the activity now is picking up. And as they pickup crews they\u2019re going to see lower and lower efficiencies because of just the quality. The assumption is the best people are out on the active crews now, but we have a great wealth of personnel to draw from. And I think that sets us apart because we can staff quickly. I had a call from an operator that wanted to staff up in two weeks and was concerned. We couldn\u2019t do it. And we told him it wouldn\u2019t be a problem and we\u2019re operating today and it\u2019s not a problem."

Have you seen a trend with respect to sand sourcing? Obviously, it depends on the specific customer. But among the larger ones with more durable programs moving forward, are you seeing a major shift where they\u2019re internalizing that procurement or is it pretty much the same as you\u2019ve seen over the last few years?"

I\u2019m just thinking in terms of uncertainty from here, obviously a lot of oil demand side drivers that could throw a wrench into things. Any sort of onus on you to renegotiate the facility such that it\u2019s not tied to receivables for the borrowing capacity, so you can maybe protect yourself to the downside on liquidity here."
