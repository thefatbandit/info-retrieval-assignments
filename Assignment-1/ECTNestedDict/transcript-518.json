         "Thank you, Everett. Based on the industry-wide challenges driven largely by the COVID-19 pandemic as highlighted earlier in this call, consolidated revenue decreased $14.4 million or 44.9% to $17.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to revenue of $32 million in the prior quarter ended February 29, 2020.",
         "Revenues comprised mainly a proprietary and industry-leading extraction, white label and custom manufacturing services, bulk winterized and distillate oil testing for Cannabis 2.0 market and analytical testing revenues.",
         "Revenue from the Cannabis operating segment decreased to $17.2 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared to $31.6 million in the prior quarter ended February 29 2020. As a result of reduce shipment of biomass extraction, as our partners adjusted their workforce and operations to manage through the uncertainty created by the pandemic. In addition to reduction in volume and compression in pricing realized on bulk winterized oil and distillate sales.",
         "With this face of moderation in extraction volume and frequency of the shipments to continue through the third quarter of 2020, but anticipate this production be partially offset by growth in revenue from existing and potential new unlicensed white label and custom manufacturing partnerships highlighted earlier in this call.",
         "Additionally, in the second quarter of 2020, the company generated $0.7 million in revenue from analytical testing through the company\u2019s ISO 17025 accredited lab, including $0.3 in intercompany testing revenue, an increase from the $0.6 million including $0.2 million in intercompany testing revenue in the prior quarter ended February 29, 2020.",
         "As Everett discussed earlier, the team remained focused on managing credit exposure with all customers. Trade accounts receivable decreased $12.4 million or 29.5% to $29.6 million at May 31, 2020, compared to $42.1 million at the end of the prior quarter ended February 29, 2020. Of these trade receivables, 85% are held with five Health Canada licensed customers of the company.",
         "Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company has collected as trade accounts payable outstanding with the same partners or has recorded an impairment loss provision representing 53% of the trade receivable balance, which supports the cash position of the company and speaks to the strength of our current relationships with our industry partners.",
         "Consolidated gross profit was $6.3 million or 35.8% of revenue for the second quarter of 2020, compared to the $18.1 million or 56.6% of revenue for the prior quarter ended February 29, 2020.",
         "Gross profit from the Cannabis operations for the second quarter was $6 million or 34.7%, compared to $17.7 million or 56.2% in the prior quarter ended February 29, 2020. Gross profit was impacted in the second quarter of 2020 by write-down of oil inventory of $1.5 million as a result of compression in pricing of bulk winterized and distillate oil.",
         "The analytical testing operation saw an increase in gross profit for the second quarter of $0.5 million or 69.7%, compared to $0.4 million or 72.3% in the prior quarter ended February 29, 2020.",
         "Operating expenses for the quarter were approximately $10 million, compared to $11.6 million during the prior quarter ended February 29, 2020. The decrease from the prior quarter was primarily attributable for lower wages and salaries as a result of the Government of Canada\u2019s Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy of $0.9 million, which was applied as a reduction to wages and salaries, lower share-based payments and travel and business development as a result of travel restrictions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These reductions were partially offset by higher professional fees and facility costs.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA was $2.7 million or 15.3% for the second quarter of 2020 and decreased 81.1%, compared to $14.3 million in the quarter ended February 29, 2020.",
         "For the second quarter of 2020, the company posted a net loss of $3.5 million or $0.03 per share, compared to the net income of $2.5 million or $0.02 per share for the prior quarter ended February 29, 2020.",
         "During the second quarter 2020 the company entered into a syndicated credit facility that will provide the company up to $40 million of secured debt financing and interest rates ranging from prime plus 2% to prime plus 2.5% per annum depending on certain financial covenants.",
         "The credit facility consists of a $2 million secured term loan, which is fully drawn at May 31, 2020 and up to a $20 million secured revolving loan, which has not been drawn at May 31, 2020. In addition the credit facility contained an accordion feature that could allow the company to increase the aggregate commitment by up to $10 million.",
         "The company had $45.1 million in cash and short-term investments as of May 31, 2020, compared to $44.3 million at February 29, 2020.",
         "With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator to open the lines for the Q&A."

         "Thank you, Operator. Good morning. And welcome to The Valens Company\u2019s second quarter 2020 financial results conference call. A replay of this call will be archived on the Investor Relations section of the Valens\u2019 website at www.thevalenscompany.com/investors.",

         "Joining me on the call today are Mr. Tyler Robson, Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Chris Buysen, Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Jeff Fallows, President.",
         "With that, I would now like to hand over the call to Tyler. Tyler, please go ahead.",
         "Thank you, Jeff. To begin I would like to thank our shareholders for the continued support as we navigate these uncertain times. We are looking forward to the future as Valens platform expands and gains continued recognition for the value to add manufacturing services, we have already successfully integrated into the supply chain of many leading companies.",
         "We aim to continue to get the Valens name in front of the necessary stakeholders to not only increase our exposure as a third-party manufacturer, but also to communicate the inherent potential we see in our business in the long-term.",
         "In the recent months, we have hit several exciting milestones that are aligned with our strategy to grow as a global cannabinoid-based product manufacturer, and importantly, deliver value for our shareholders. Our uplisting to the Toronto Stock Exchange on April 16th was a strategic move to support additional liquidity in our stock and broaden our reach within the investment community.",
         "We also successfully completed our continuance out of British Columbia to become federally incorporated as The Valens Company, a new name, which we believe better reflects the strategic vision and identity of the business, and in addition to these milestones, I have seen our institutional research coverage expand.",
         "In order to strengthen our balance sheet, mitigate risks and to allow us to continue to focus on growing our core operation, we entered in this syndicated credit facility as announced earlier in June with CIBC and ATB Financial for up to $40 million of secured debt financing at an attractive rates. This increases our confidence in our balance sheet and offers us a strong foundation that will allow us to leverage attractive investment opportunities as we emerge on the other side of the current market challenges.",
         "We believe our share price remain undervalued and in the second quarter we started to buy back shares under our Normal Course Issuer Bid, as an effective and immediate way to return value for shareholders.",
         "The company acquired 43,600 of its common shares through a Normal Course Issuer Bid during the month of May 2020 at a price range of $2.24 to $2.25 per share. The company will continue to evaluate the opportunity to purchase additional shares under the Normal Course Issuer Bid in the coming quarters and will continue to provide updates to shareholders.",
         "We are making crucial strides developing our intellectual properties that will support an attractive pipeline of opportunities. As Jeff mentioned, we are producing an ever expanding range of SKUs, and our ability to efficiently and quickly turnaround new product is constantly improving.",
         "To support these efforts, we are increasing our manufacturing capacity at our facility North Toronto [ph], which upon completion we expect to be used in the production of beverages, edibles and sourced products. We are currently on track to have this facility operational at the start of 2021.",
         "The construction at our K2 facility in Kelowna is almost complete and is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2020. Once this facility comes online we will add increased scale to a number of our manufacturing capability necessary to meet the 2.0 market demand.",
         "We are currently a market leader in the 2.0 cannabis product space but with these expansions we will -- we expect to truly become a premier Canadian manufacturer of oil-based cannabis products with the ultimate ability to distribute products globally. We have received the oil-based products market growing rapidly and we believe it will continue -- it eventually dominates the cannabis retail sales in Canada.",
         "We achieved our goal of reducing our accounts receivable balance in the second quarter. This is a result of the internal controls that management has put in the place to facilitate appropriate payment terms and timeliness ultimately creating a win-win scenario for both parties. We are working hard to have our AR continue to decline in the coming quarters, ultimately reflecting a decrease in AR as a percentage of revenue.",
         "As always, communicating effectively and transparently with our stakeholders and shareholders, and maximizing return on invested capital remains core to our operating philosophy. We will continue to provide important updates to the investment community, stay tune.",
         "With that, I will now turn the call over to Chris Buysen, CFO to talk about our financial results."
      ],
      "Jeff Fallows": [
         "Thank you, Tyler. As noted, it has been a challenging quarter as several of our customers have experienced reduced workforces and decreases in cultivation output, which have resulted in a reduction in demand for our extraction services.",
         "With this in mind, we are cognizant of the need to run our company responsibly and are carefully monitoring our concentration risk, as well as the creditworthiness of our customers. We are also being selective in the extraction customers as we are on-boarding.",
         "Overall, we believe that we are navigating in the current market challenges successfully and are making solid progress in expanding our custom manufacturing and white label business segment, which is the key pillar of our strategy and is expected to be the primary driver of future revenue growth.",
         "We believe we have the most advanced and adaptable 2.0 platform in the market to manufacture innovative and differentiated products as demonstrated by our scale, diversity of our technical capabilities and the quality of our products. This, together with the strength of our customer relationships puts us in a strong position to be a leader in the industry even with the market challenges experienced over the past several months.",
         "As a result, we are expecting aggregate EBITDA growth to accelerate from current levels with the bulk of our growth expected to come in fiscal Q4 as a significant number of our new 2.0 products hit the shelves.",
         "While we are disappointed that the decline in revenue from extraction services has impacted our financial results for the quarter, we have made significant progress during this time to position our business to realize on the many emerging market opportunities we face.",
         "In addition to the white label partnership with A1 Cannabis Company, a subsidiary of Iconic Brewing we continue to see growing demand for quality products in the market that have translated into signed customer agreements.",
         "Our customized offerings differentiate Valens in the market and enable us to empower our customers, gain market share and expand our operations. We only expect this demand to grow as we bring hydrocarbon products including crumble, live resin and other concentrates to market in Q3 and beyond. We are pleased that we have completed our first shipment of crumble at the beginning of July, the first ultra-premium concentrate offering in the country in partnership with Verse Cannabis.",
         "Our pipeline of manufacturing opportunities extends beyond Canada and we continue to engage in discussions with global players with a view to penetrating international markets and accelerating our growth as legalization spreads worldwide.",
         "We recently signed a five-year distribution agreement with Cannvalate, Australia\u2019s largest medicinal cannabis distributor and clinical research organization. We see a great potential on the Australian market, as it is currently the second largest cannabis market outside of North America.",
         "The partnership provides The Valens\u2019 the platform to establish in its initial operations and pursue required licensing in Australia bringing Valens\u2019 high quality oil-based products to a growing medicinal patient base and ultimately a broader consumer market.",
         "In the short-term, we are focused on monetizing this agreement through the shipments of a broad range of products from our facility in Canada to Australia, which we expect to start in the third quarter of 2020, subject to receiving the necessary import and export permits.",
         "We are also in the process of finalizing a long-term lease on a property in Australia with a view to building out a manufacturing facility that will serve as the hub of our operations in the country and grow both in the scale and capability as the market demand dictates.",
         "Construction on the facility is expected to commit -- commence upon the signing of the lease and is expected to be -- and the facility is expected to be fully operational halfway through 2020 or through 2021, excuse me, subject to applicable licensing and regulatory approvals.",
         "Our agreement with Cannvalate is an important step forward in our targeted global expansion strategy, which focuses on developing distribution channels and near-term revenue opportunities with shorter payback periods rather than an asset heavy model.",
         "As discussed on our last call, we expect global cannabis revenue within 2020 with the potential for facilities on the ground internationally in 2021. Meanwhile we have seen an uptick in demand for 2.0 products in Canada and I have signed several new custom manufacturing partnerships to launch brand new products with leading brands.",
         "We entered into an agreement with TREC Brands to manufacture and sell vape pen as a new product format across three of their existing brands with a potential for expansion to other products in the future.",
         "We also entered into an initial five-year manufacturing and distribution agreement with Verse Cannabis to develop a range of high quality products such as concentrates, vapes, oils and water-based products, leveraging sourced by Valens emulsion technology under two separate product lines. Both the Verse and TREC agreements allow a royalty based payment structure and are expected to generate long-term revenue for the company.",
         "Other recent milestones include the launch of our premium vape line made by in partnership with the signing of an initial two-year agreement with high and new brands to develop and manufacture a premium line of vape products under the DAIZE brand portfolio, as well as a two year agreement with FPS Brands to develop and manufacture a craft line of temporized CBD products under the ufeelu portfolio.",
         "As noted, we are pleased that despite the challenging market environment, we continue to hit many critical milestones in the strategic development of the company and have made material strides in growing our custom manufacturing segment with many more opportunities under negotiation. We will continue to accelerate the scale up of our product development capabilities by developing additional IP to launch several new product formats.",
         "We have manufactured a record 36 SKUs that exceeded our estimate of 25 mentioned in the first quarter of 2020 conference call leading to increased Canadian market share. The number of SKUs in development, as well as product offerings are expected to increase throughout the second half of 2020 as our white label and custom manufacturing agreements grow and revenue from extraction contracts contributes to a smaller proportion of total revenue.",

         "As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Everett Knight, Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and Capital Markets of The Valens Company. Everett, please go ahead."

      "Tyler Robson": [
         "Thank you, Everett. And welcome to everyone that has joined our earnings call to discuss our results for the second quarter ended May 31, 2020. As we navigate the unpredictable events of 2020, I appreciate this opportunity to speak directly to our shareholders today and provide a corporate update.",
         "Later in today\u2019s call, Jeff Fallows will provide a more comprehensive update on our recent operational achievements, Everett and I will provide an overview on our capital markets achievements and Chris Buysen will give an overview of our financial results for the second quarter. But first I am going to recap the last quarter\u2019s performance and talk about the trends we are seeing in sectors.",
         "Today we are undeniably facing challenges that reflect the global volatility and economic uncertainty across each sector as a result of this pandemic. However, I would like to make it clear that to all of our shareholders that despite the noise of the current environment, we are focused on executing our corporate strategy, maintaining profitability, securing solid partnerships that drive the most value for our accelerated platform with the views of creating long-term shareholder value.",
         "Revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $17.6 million, 100.3% increase from $8.8 million in the second quarter of 2019 and a 44.9% decrease from $32 million in the previous quarter ended February 29, 2020.",
         "Gross profit increased to $6.3 million or 35.8% of revenue for the second quarter of 2020, compared to $5.1 million or 57.9% of revenue in the same period fiscal 2019. The decrease -- and decreased 65.1%, compared to $18.1 million in the previous quarter ended February 29, 2020.",
         "Adjusted EBITDA was $2.7 million or 15.3% of revenue for the second quarter of 2020, compared to $2 million or 23% of revenue in the second quarter of 2019 and decreased 81.1%, compared to $14.3 million for the quarter ended February 29, 2020. These results while representing a pullback from our previous five quarters of quarterly reported growth, demonstrates a continued advancement of our strategic plan amidst the challenging market backdrop.",
         "Well demand for total extraction has negatively impacted as a result of the current environment our strategic plan has not changed. We have made significant progress on building our white label and custom manufacturing platform in the addition to working to secure more opportunities as they arise in this high margin segment.",
         "Again, this quarter we attribute a decrease in total extraction revenue with distillate product sales due to slowdown across the cannabis sector as we and our customers adopt to a more cautious approach to casting vote [ph], which we expect to continue to the third quarter -- third fiscal quarter.",
         "However, we continue to remain optimistic about the return of total extraction volumes as many of you including our customers, they will have large drive cannabis inventory which they can better monetize through conversion to oil based products.",
         "In the second quarter, we shifted our focus to extracting Valens-owned cannabis and hemp biomass, processing over 30,000 kilograms to prepare for anticipated inventory requirements for 2.0 product offerings in later half of 2020. Growing retail sales and many successful product launches across the country signal market demand for more 2.0 products.",
         "Regards to the challenges presented in the second quarter, The Valens Company remained a partner choice for many of the industry\u2019s leading licensed producers and branded companies as we hold a necessary capability to be -- to successfully execute on every step of the product development and supply chain.",
         "The increased revenue from our custom manufacturing, white label and co-packing agreement is expected to continue as both new and existing customers recognize the value of our platform. We currently have a strong pipeline to support the future launch of 2.0 products in the marketplace. This unique custom manufacturing agreement we signed subsequent to quarter end are expected to drive significant revenue growth in the second half of 2020.",
         "Throughout the second quarter we continue to execute on our existing contract to support our customers as they introduced more 2.0 product format to Canadian consumers. Our internal record of launching a new product is -- product in 44 days demonstrates Valens commitment to our partners, as well as gaining available market share for our value-add product.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Jeff Fallows, President of The Valens Company to dive deeper into our operational achievement in this quarter and outlook on the rest of the year, as well as provide more details on how we are adapting to the current environment. I will be available to answer questions at the end of this call."

The first I want to circle back kind of the expectations around tolling and extraction, obviously, a bit of a disappointment, which is not at all your fault coming from a, I guess, many of the cannabis license producers. So I am wondering just from your expectations and how we should be thinking about this, given the great uncertainty with COVID-19 and the pandemic, and how this will further impact the LPs ability to really come to you as a trusted provider to extract product? How should we be thinking about the ramp moving forward, not just in the next quarter, I mean, given that we are both halfway through this quarter already, but even into 2021, what are your expectations for tooling coming back and why as well? Thank you."

So just -- I will allocate those questions that way and I will take a first shot at your question, David.",
            "So, obviously, it\u2019s very hard for us to predict what\u2019s going to be coming down the pipe in the wake of COVID and how quickly those extraction services will come back. But what we do know is from a bounce platform perspective, we continue to offer the most of first platform and scale available in the market to help LPs and players in the market to meet their ongoing requirements.",
            "So as we move to the next -- in the end of 2020 and in the end of 2021, the -- we could do think that the cost profile and the flexibility that our platform offers will be a very attractive option when those extraction margins or extraction volumes do come back."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yeah. And maybe just to expand. It\u2019s Everett, David. As we discussed before there is -- at Health Canada, of course, last week, there is 620,000 kilograms of dried cannabis inventory on license producers\u2019 balance sheet. So it\u2019s not like there are in the lack of dry cannabis inventory. What COVID has done is put pressure on their balance sheets, and obviously, we are having conversation to get that back online.",
            "But if you just model out our manufacturing footprint today, the reason I view us more stable in this environment as a manufacturing company is really as we have gone and not only have licensed producers on our platform but as we have on-boarded a whole bunch of these third-party players whether they are CPG companies, whether they are brand companies that don\u2019t have licensing, what we have been doing is we have been distributing those manufacturing products.",
            "And I think with the last four announcements recently along with BRNT now in Alberta you are seeing more visibility on that front on the platform and you are seeing that really translate through in the financials going from nine SKUs in Q1, so that\u2019s 36 SKUs this quarter. And I would say just modeling that, we have an attractive platform and as these extractors come back in and figure out their balance sheets trouble it\u2019s just icing on the cake for us."

Moving on to your white label segment and custom manufacturing, a number of the deals if not all of them that have hit the wire over the last little bit, I think, 36 in total, I think, around four in the last six weeks alone, but there\u2019s obviously a royalty structure in place here as opposed to the minimum supply agreements previously held as patrolling. I guess my question on the royalty structures, I am going to assume that you are not disclosing specifics, because you haven\u2019t previously, but how should we be thinking about these royalty structures as far as each individual contract. Are these based from your up at the end of the bigger customer and it depends what sales they are bringing in which will ultimately drive your royalties or is it based on the quantities regardless of sale that you are producing? Thank you."

But in general, the way you can look at it as the more that they are able to bring to the table in terms of sales team, marketing platform or existing brand profile the more of a royalty -- of the higher the royalty that will be allocated to that customer, the more we are doing it and the more our platform is the key ingredient the more the lower the royalty will be, but certainly as those brands begin to pick up momentum in the market and establish -- formerly establish their position those economics may change as they prove that the brands can grab most part in the market."

Can you give us an idea to kind of what portion of these SKUs were for existing white label contracts that you have already secured and what portion was really in anticipation of signing future contracts? And the second part of this question is, would you consider directly selling maybe a part of these SKUs to provincial bodies under The Valens brand since you have already manufactured it? Thank you."

It -- there is no intention internally on launching -- to be launching our Valens brand. We want to make sure that we are providing our ongoing customers, current customers and future customers with the ability to differentiate their brands and launching products to the market.

The inventory that we are manufacturing really is specific to that partnership that we are creating with them, so all of the SKUs, the 36 SKUs that we manufactured this quarter would be for existing partnerships that were in place at that time, because it is a specific product that we are developing in partnership with each individual partner."

That\u2019s the number one and beverages as well, like I said earlier in the call, the consumer experience in -- on some of the other beverages have been underwhelming. So the feedback on ours launched successfully has been tremendous. So I think those are the two biggest unique opportunities.",

We truly believe topicals is going to be a very dominant player coming out and we are really pushing on that and few other hydrocarbon extracts. So we are really, really pushing hydrocarbon right now, but I think, the entire 2.0 category is lacking.",
            "Part of it too is consistency and quality, and a price point that works for consumers. There is a lot of these license producers having played a cost of production to gain their profit or any margin, now that they are pricing themselves at the category, not moving essentially quickly. So with down value-add services, we can really kind of come in and undercut the market and push volume."

In future quarters especially going in to 2021, I think, we can really as we are selling mostly end products on the manufacturing side and distributing them. Our input cost is going down dramatically, right on that front every single day, which is really a tailwind for margin going into that 2021. So I think that\u2019s an opportunity.",
            "I think and just to reiterate Jeff\u2019s comments, we are the lowest cost producer as an extraction company in the cannabis space from our knowledge today. So, I think, that, yes, we have seen compression of oil sales, which is not as big of a core competency for us, we have already been more strategic on the custom manufacturing side, but the extraction footprint, I don\u2019t think we are worried about the compression on that and we haven\u2019t seen as much as on the distillate sale side."

We are in the business of bringing brands to market.

So we saw a report of strong demand for those 2.0 products as the stay-at-home measures that came into place earlier. I think beverages and edibles are about 25% of sales in May. So as the summer months start rolling around we are seeing these restrictions kind of loosen up and people aren\u2019t in home as much. So have you seen from your level of visibility any shifts on the demand or the market share side for these beverages and edibles products? And are they trending upwards or downwards into June -- into the June, July the summer months where people aren\u2019t at home as much and they might be shifting more towards vape or bio type product?"

So month-over-month growth as far as beverages, so a lot of people don\u2019t understand like the core can take the beverages we put on the market so they are rather healthy, there is no hangover. So we see 10, 50 people actually moving away from the alcohol into those beverages. And I can\u2019t really comment on edible growth right now because that\u2019s something what we never really gone after.",

Maybe just to expand on that comment too, like that, we are impressed with the sales in May in Ontario were 25% that you said came from edible, dates and beverages. But if you look at that category of the edibles category beverages made up 28% and that\u2019s the fastest growth we have seen. So as Tyler mentioned, we are seeing that growth continue and 25% of the Cannabis 2.0 category is way ahead of analyst estimates.",

And if you look at the U.S. marketplace roadmap for Canada it\u2019s really a greater than 50% of the products now are oil based products, which is really our core competency as a manufacture.

We have been able to source recently some well-priced cannabis and we do have agreements in place on the hemp side as well for favorable pricing from our view. So, overall, similar margin profile between the two."

Again kind of continuing to kind of monitor developments and compression that we have seen in pricing historically, but as we kind of shift and start to deploy this inventory into kind of consumer packaged goods through our white label program and being able to realize more value off of that, that will I guess further mitigate the risk of additional write-downs in the future as well."

Are they coming down quite dramatically or stabilizing or any insight there will be helpful? Thanks."

But, overall yes, we are -- there is a downward pressure on pricing in the wholesale market from our perspective, I\u2019d say, for sure. But I also say that there\u2019s opportunistic purchases that we make based on different relationships and different opportunities for us to buy some attractive product and that\u2019s one of the benefits of the balance sheet that allows us to be opportunistic and realize those lower price inputs.

The evolution of our business in the premier manufacturer has begun and we are fully confident in the resources and capabilities we possess to lead on a global scale.",
