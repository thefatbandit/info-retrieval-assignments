         "Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning, everyone. Before discussing our outlook, I\u2019ll briefly recap our results. Total revenue was approximately $173 million, up 7% year-over-year. Software and products revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $76.6 million, an all-time first quarter record. Software revenue growth was driven by a significant increase in large enterprise deals and a successful initial subscription renewal effort.",
         "Software transactions over $100,000 increased 41% year-over-year to approximately $56 million. These large deals represented 73% of software revenue in the current quarter compared to 62% a year ago. The number of these transactions increased approximately 5% year-over-year and the average deal size exceeded $400,000, approximately 35% higher year-over-year.",
         "The increase in large software transactions was driven by an all-time record contribution from seven-figure deals. This included the largest ever purchase order in company history, a subscription transaction with an eight-figure total contract value, in addition to two other very large deals. While we are pleased with our ability to close these large deals, they influence the contribution mix from subscription and recurring revenue as well as the average deal size and should not be considered a baseline for the next few quarters.",
         "Fiscal first quarter services revenue was approximately $96 million, declining 2% year-over-year. The decline was primarily due to COVID-related restrictions, which impacted on-site professional services. In addition, maintenance revenue growth was impacted by the strategic transition of legacy perpetual customers to subscription licensing arrangements. These conversions benefit us over the longer term, because of the associated opportunity to drive lifetime value with an active customer.",
         "Let me now discuss our continued transition to a more recurring revenue-based model. As you know, prior to FY '18, we primarily sold perpetual contracts. At that time, subscription and usage-based utility contracts accounted for less than 10% of our software and products revenue. Recurring revenue, which included subscription software and maintenance, represented approximately 50% of total revenue.",
         "Beginning in FY '18, we introduced subscription-based pricing that align to our customers\u2019 workloads and purchasing preferences. FY '21 marks the first year of our subscription renewal cycle. This opportunity represents a positive inflection point for our business. We expect the upcoming renewal cycle to serve as a revenue tailwind in FY '21 and beyond.",
         "As Sanjay described, the announcement that we made at FutureReady represent an important streamlining of our product, packaging, and pricing strategy. We expect this evolution will continue to result in even more subscription-based recurring revenue over time. In order to best report and measure our business consistent with the way customers consume our products and services, we will be increasingly focused on the following three operating metrics; subscription as a percentage of software and products revenue, recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue, and annual recurring revenue or ARR.",
         "Now, I\u2019ll take a moment to discuss each of these metrics. In Q1 FY '21, subscription revenue represented approximately 69% of total software revenue versus less than 10% in FY '17. We added approximately 200 subscription customers in the quarter, and our subscription net dollar retention rate was above 100% exceeding our initial expectations.",
         "Our total recurring revenue increased 24% year-over-year to $141 million and represented 82% of total revenue in the quarter. This compares to approximately 50% in FY '17. This quarter, we are also introducing annual recurring revenue or ARR. We define ARR as the annualized value of Commvault\u2019s recurring revenue streams at a point in time. Going forward, ARR will replace ACV, because we believe it is a better measure of our recurring revenue streams. As of June 30, 2020, our ARR increased 9% year-over-year to approximately $472 million.",
         "Now, I'll discuss expenses and profitability. During the quarter, we remained disciplined on expenses. Q1 FY '21 expenses, including both cost of sales and operating expenses, declined 4% year-over-year to $138 million, resulting in an EBIT of $32.5 million and an EBIT margin of 18.8%. Both EBIT dollars and EBIT margins approximately doubled year-over-year.",
         "We note that Q1 FY '21 benefited from approximately $12 million of temporary and COVID-related expense reductions. We expect approximately half of these reductions to repeat in Q2, while the balance of these temporary reductions are likely to return to near prior levels as business normalizes. Our focus on prudent cost management continues.",
         "Now, I'll discuss our financial outlook for Q2 FY '21. For the second quarter of FY '21, we expect total revenue of approximately $164 million. We expect software and products revenue to be at least flat year-over-year or $69 million. Please note that the subscription renewal opportunity in Q2 FY '21 is the lowest of the year.",
         "In addition, the SME segment remains challenged and COVID continues to create overall macro uncertainty. That said, we believe our renewals, enhanced product and pricing strategy and refined go-to-market motion should more meaningfully contribute to results in the second half of the year.",
         "Beginning in Q2 FY '21, with the integration of Hedvig into our new HyperScale X platform, we expect to see a reduction of certain third-party royalties to benefit gross margins by approximately 100 basis points for the balance of the fiscal year. As noted, we also expect that some of the temporary cost reductions we saw in Q1 will begin to normalize.",
         "As a result, we expect OpEx to modestly increase sequentially. We will remain disciplined in aligning our underlying operating expense base to current revenue levels, and we've identified other potential cost-saving actions. With that, we expect Q2 FY '21 EBIT margins to be approximately 13%. Lastly, our projected share count for Q2 is approximately 47 million shares.",
         "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Sanjay for some closing remarks. Sanjay?"

      "Sanjay Mirchandani": [
         "Good morning. Thank you, Mike. Thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fiscal first quarter results. Over the past several quarters, we\u2019ve spoken about the need to simplify everything we do; deliver a best-in-class portfolio and confidently and crisply execute our plans internally and through our partner ecosystem.",
         "During Q1, we successfully started our first subscription renewal cycle. We received the largest PO in our history, an eight-figure subscription deal. We hit an all-time high in average enterprise deal size. We posted a record dollar contribution from seven-figure deals, and we signed a multiyear agreement with Microsoft.",
         "I\u2019m proud to say that companies are increasingly using our technology to help them move into the cloud. This was further validated last week when Gartner named us as the leader in their 2020 Magic Quadrant for Backup and Recovery Solutions, and Commvault was the first vendor to ever score highest in all three categories of their accompanying Critical Capabilities report; the public cloud, virtual and physical environments.",
         "As we\u2019ve previously discussed, enterprises are grappling with more infrastructure applications and complexity than ever before, especially when compounded with nonstop security threats and rapid change we\u2019ve all experienced especially over the past few months. To tackle the complexity head on, we unveiled our intelligent data management vision at our FutureReady event last week, which is composed of three critical elements; first, our portfolio; second, our partnerships; and third, our executional excellence initiatives.",
         "Let\u2019s discuss each one by one, starting with our portfolio. We never stop innovating. It is core to who we are and it gives us a critical edge in a very competitive industry. At FutureReady, we unveiled our newly expanded and revitalized portfolio to empower organizations to reduce this complexity, reign in the data fragmentation, and accelerate their cloud journeys. It includes a new stand-alone Commvault backup and recovery product and a new Commvault disaster recovery product, or both can be bundled together as a complete data protection offering.",
         "We also introduced Commvault HyperScale X, the next generation of our HyperScale product, which brings together the best of Commvault data protection with Hedvig storage management. This is a significant achievement. And Hedvig now has enhanced support for containerized workloads and is integrated for Kubernetes deployments to help DevOps professionals accelerate their application journey.",
         "We believe these capabilities are unmatched in the industry, and they enable our customers to accelerate their digital transformation in today's remote world using tools that are low-touch, light-touch, use AI and machine learning to automate workflows and are available with flexible cloud-based pricing. But products alone aren\u2019t enough. Our partners are critical in bringing value to our customers.",
         "In Q1 of '21, we signed a strategic multiyear partnership with Microsoft. Focused on offering our Metallic SaaS with Azure, we\u2019ll be working closely on go-to-market engineering and sales activities to unlock more joint opportunities. We also had strong contributions and interest from our partner ecosystem. To further the momentum, we recently launched a simplified and well-received partner program which brings me to the third initiative, executional excellence.",
         "Our go-to-market teams are gaining momentum and leaving no stone unturned. Our ability to deliver complex solutions, mostly remotely, is now mainstream for us. Looking ahead, we believe our enhanced portfolio and ability to upsell and cross-sell our solutions will enable us to land new customers and maximize customer lifetime value. While we have work to do, we\u2019re optimistic about our return to predictable and sustainable growth.",
         "With that, let me turn it over to Brian to provide some financial highlights and our Q2 '21 outlook. Brian?",
         "Thanks, Brian. Before questions, I\u2019ll take a moment to reaffirm our focus on portfolio partnerships and executional excellence.",
         "First, I believe portfolio advancements, like HyperScale X, demonstrate our commitment to innovation and bring immense value to our customers. Second, our strategic partnerships and endorsement from marquee customers, like McDonald's and Johns Hopkins, reaffirms our ability to provide the flexibility and choice customers need.",
         "And last, with our expanded portfolio, impressive partner ecosystem and executional excellence, we believe we can grow the top line while increasing our efficiency. Our performance this past quarter is a solid indication of where we expect to take Commvault next.",
         "Mike, let\u2019s open it up for questions."

And then just to clarify that this was a \u2013 that there was a large chunk of this that was recognized upfront, because of 606?"

We had a small footprint in the account, and the customer had a very unique use case that required our activate product suite to come in and sort of show what we could do from a data optimization point of view. And then, obviously they wanted to make sure they protected all that. So, it was an Activate-led and data protection followed piece of business, and the bulk of that \u2013 a lot of that was done with a partner and done remotely."

What do you attribute that too? We\u2019re in a pandemic. I wouldn\u2019t expect I guess customers to be doing very large projects like that. We\u2019ve certainly heard of many instances of customers downsizing deals and only spending exactly what they need right now. But give us just some sense from all the different deals that closed, is there some common themes and anything that can help us understand why these deals happened when they did?"

I think that once the implications of COVID became real, data protection came back on the agenda for customers, because with mass data fragmentation, remote workers with no access to data centers, data protection business continuity bubbles up to the top as being important. And so, I think once the structural shift, if you would, of saying, okay, this is the new world order happened, then as part of the reprioritization process, data protection did bubble up to the top, and that\u2019s how I look at it. And, Brian, anything you want to --"

As we think about the contributions of that opportunity, is there a way to frame for us how we should think about the base of subscription opportunity that you\u2019re executing on through the course of this year? Any kind of framework of how large that could be or what that base of business looks like? And then also on that topic, you talked a little bit or mentioned in the prepared remarks about cross-sell, upsell opportunities. What have you seen so far? How do we think about that in the context of going after those subscription opportunities?"

Overall with subscription, as we talk to our customers on a more classic land, expand, renew sort of cycle, we are sharing things like our new DR product that was just released, Activate, which allows them to do more with the data they have, Metallic for remote branches and Office 365 type scenarios. So we have an opportunity with the portfolio now. Early days, but we have an opportunity with the portfolio to really take more to our customers as they sort of evolve in the lifecycle of what we\u2019re calling intelligent data management."

            "Good morning, Aaron. It\u2019s Brian here. So, just to touch on the subscription opportunity. You\u2019ve been following us for several years now. We\u2019ve been on this journey, and it\u2019s reassuring to see that what was a headwind for us is now starting to become a tailwind. We, in last fiscal year, about 40% of our software and products revenue was from subscription-based pricing models. This past quarter, it was almost 70%. We think that the majority of our software and products revenue is going to continue to go towards subscription. So we\u2019re happy with that. We think that\u2019s a great opportunity for us both near and long term. Also the renewal opportunity that we spoke about on prior earnings calls represents about a $50 million software opportunity for the year. The majority of that is in the second half. Q2 specifically is the low point of the year in terms of the opportunity. That\u2019s why we\u2019re being a little bit more cautious with that, but we\u2019re off to a really good start in Q1. As I mentioned, we had our net retention rate was above 100%. We\u2019re pleased with that start to the year, and we\u2019re seeing opportunities now with our new product launch increases; cross sell, upsell opportunities. That will come as the year unfolds in time."

When do we think that that starts to kick in from an incremental revenue contribution perspective with Metallic? And then I think in the past you\u2019ve talked a little bit about how much data you\u2019ve managed into the public cloud arena. Can you just give us an update how that\u2019s progressed?"

This one\u2019s focused on SaaS, Azure, Metallic. And again, it\u2019s a multiyear \u2013 our ambition is multiyear. So I think we will start seeing traction as we build out the plans later in the year and beyond. We\u2019re excited about that. I think it\u2019s a very nice alignment. The technology and the engineering is \u2013 we\u2019ve made some commitments to really make sure that we work tightly together for customers and solutioning, go-to-market, all elements of the relationship, but there\u2019s work to do and to make it real. On the number that we\u2019ve shared historically, we were getting around internally that it\u2019s gotten the point where billions and billions surf, so maybe we don\u2019t release it. But I would say to you that well over an exabyte has been written based on what we have been reporting, and it\u2019s growing roughly 15% quarter-on-quarter, and that\u2019s a healthy clip. That tells you our place in the public cloud for customers and data. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re going. And you saw what Gartner said in their Critical Capabilities list across virtual, physical, and cloud, we\u2019re number one."

I guess, are you able to see better win rates with deal over, say, $0.5 million because of the move to subscription? And then I guess how does that impact your view on future renewal opportunities and the size there? So large deals, move to subscription and how this changes the competitive nature in these larger opportunities?"

So yes, the renewals, the opportunities that it creates is really refreshing to see. So we\u2019ve been at this for a while. It\u2019s our first year of inflection. It\u2019s a positive inflection point for us as a company and we\u2019re off to a good start. Again, a lot of this is going to be weighted towards the second half of the year, but it opens up conversations with the customers more importantly. And when we go in there, we\u2019re not just selling more data protection. We\u2019ve got a wider array of product portfolio to offer to them. So that\u2019s a reassuring thing for us. I won\u2019t get into exact things about win rates, but I will say that this gives us more options in terms of their workloads, whether they\u2019re moving to the cloud, whether they\u2019re distributed data fragmentation, we help them pull that all in and sometimes they prefer a subscription model to do that, and often we lead with that. So it\u2019s a choice we offer them."

That spilled over from Q4 into Q1. But then we followed that up with some really large seven-figure deals that were sourced and closed. The largest one that we talked about, it was sourced and closed within quarter. So it\u2019s a testament to the fact that when you have a customer and you\u2019re the incumbent and you have the solution to offer and they\u2019re not happy with their other competitive solutions that they have in place, we\u2019re able to displace that. So that drove the need. And also the new products offerings, specifically of Activate, really resonated with that customer and helped drive the deal."

Our go-to-market teams, our partnership models, they\u2019re kind of hitting their stride now and sort of did what we said we would \u2013 what we were hoping they would do.

I guess what was the main feedback from the product launches in terms of what was really of interest with customers? Obviously, you had a bunch of new announcements. Just curious as to which one generated the most interest? And then just understanding that it\u2019s becoming more integrated, like with HyperScale X, but what was Hedvig\u2019s contribution this quarter?"

And so the sense is that the lifecycle of simplifying technology so that they can \u2013 and making it more granular so they could work with pieces of it, all of it, some of it really was appreciated. I\u2019d say that the \u2013 you asked about Hedvig and we\u2019ve been reasonably quiet at work integrating Hedvig into the core, and when I say that, this is sort of the vision we put out when we acquired Hedvig, which is bringing the best storage management capabilities and coupling it with what we\u2019re best known for in data protection and bringing customers through scale-out capability that is next generation. And it\u2019s super, super simple to use. We really focused on simplification as a core. Hedvig as a stand-alone is \u2013 customers are looking at it, using it, kicking the tires with it. And now we\u2019ve really enhanced our \u2013 we have always had it, but now we\u2019ve really enhanced our container capability in the product with Kubernetes support and automation backup capabilities inside of Hedvig file systems, so that we\u2019re really giving DevOps and DevOps customers a DevOps native way of sort of doing this. So by and large, depending on the audience, it was well received and what was really well received was the simplification of the portfolio in the use case."

That\u2019s not insignificant. So that was another component of this launch."

Yes, we acknowledge that total revenue is slightly down year-over-year. We are at an inflection point for the quarter, as we said. We\u2019re still in the COVID uncertainty right now. Our renewal opportunity is not as large. In fact, it\u2019s much less than it was in Q1. We think that SME, the small and mid enterprise, is particularly impacted by the COVID uncertainty. So I think there\u2019s some weakness there. Having said that, we\u2019re optimistic about the second half of this fiscal year and a return to growth. We\u2019re going to have the larger subscription renewal opportunity, we\u2019ll have more quarters under our belt in terms of our overall with aging and experience and maturity. And we also have the new products and pricing strategies that we just unveiled. So the combination of all those things, and hopefully we come out of this whole COVID uncertainty by that point in time, but we are poised to return to growth. That\u2019s our objective."

And so when I say multiprotocol, it has virtual machines, it has containers, it has optic storage so on and so forth. So in one software layer, you can do multiple types of applications. What it brought to us was that rich capability, which we\u2019ve now enhanced our appliance, our HyperScale appliance with that level of software-defined storage below it. So it gives a rich set of enhanced capabilities and scale-out on the health of the system, on cloud capabilities. There\u2019s a lot that they bring into it in and of itself. So that\u2019s how it\u2019s helped us integrate. And then the entire stack, right, that we present as part of our HyperScale is tightly integrated, is super simplified for customers. In a few clicks, you\u2019re up and running and doing complex data protection use cases. On its own, we\u2019ve also enhanced with the latest release of Hedvig a lot more Kubernetes and container capabilities that DevOps type engineers can use to build next-generation containerized applications. So it\u2019s all of that. I hope that was the right level."
