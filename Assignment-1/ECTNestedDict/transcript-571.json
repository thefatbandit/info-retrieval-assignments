      "Andrew Halford": [
         "Thank you very much, Bill, and good morning, good afternoon to everybody. So if we can go on to Slide 5, the overview of the financials for the period. And I\u2019ll just pull out one or two things before we go into them in more detail afterwards.",
         "So if you recall in the first quarter when COVID was primarily affecting the northern part of our region, we published a 6% growth in income on a constant currency basis, excluding DVA. Second quarter, I think, actually has proven to be very resilient, so a quarter when the whole of the business was impacted, but we still have printed a 4% increase in income. So for the half year as a whole, 5% up, an $8 billion print on income, with NIMs lower as we expected. In terms of operating expenses, those were 5% lower, so good cost control. And the two of those together have given us a pre-provision operating profit which is up 22% compared with the first half of last year.",
         "On credit impairment side, we took a charge of $1 billion in the first quarter. We have increased that by $0.6 billion in the second quarter to give a half year total charge of $1.6 billion. And when you put that all together in terms of underlying operating profit, we are down 25%. But we have still printed a $2 billion operating profit for the first half, notwithstanding the significant provisioning. The impact of that, unsurprisingly, on the RoTE is that\u2019s being reduced, so 6% for the first half of the year.",
         "The CET1 is strong, 14.3%, so that\u2019s coming just above the top of the range that we have been working to. And liquidity in the period was also very strong, 149%, a lot of work done to improve the mix of liabilities during the period.",
         "So if I move then on to Slide 6. This is showing the split of the income growth, both looking at the first half compared with the first half last year and the second quarter compared with the second quarter last year at the bottom. All numbers on here, we\u2019ve stripped DVA out so that these are the raw numbers. And you can see a fairly similar pattern really on both the top and the bottom, very, very strong performance from Financial Markets, particularly in the second quarter. And that has more than outweighed the interest rate effect, particularly in the Transaction Banking business, which, as we expected, has been impacted during the period, both in terms of margins and in terms of volumes.",
         "On the second quarter, the other factor in there, a little bit has been Wealth Management, which, because of activity levels in the period, has held us back a little, albeit more recent trends on that are actually looking more encouraging.",
         "So turning to Slide 7 and net interest income. You can see on the left-hand side of the chart here, $3.6 billion print for the half year, which is down 10% on last year. We said at the end of the first quarter that interest rates would have an impact on the full year, and that is what we are seeing here. Since then, if anything, the curves have flattened a little bit. We\u2019ve seen the 3-month HIBOR go to the lowest levels it\u2019s been at for several years, driven by significant capital inflows actually into Hong Kong, and obviously, it does have an impact upon the overall NIM as well. So if you look at the NIM, 1.28% for the most recent quarter.",
         "On the bottom of the chart, you can see the average interest earning assets and the liabilities, both of which continue to move ahead, about 3% or 4%. And then we have also taken the opportunity to update the sensitivity to interest rates. Last time we did that was at the end of last year before interest rates dropped so sharply, and as a consequence now of being near to 0 interest rate sensitivity, obviously, on those has increased. So the plus $180 million minus $335 million is now the sensitivity to 50 basis point movements in interest rate.",
         "So moving then on to Slide 8, which is the other income, just over half of the income for the business overall. And the color coding on the left-hand side, the top part is fees; the bottom part is trading. So on the top half, the fee income and the fees and commissions was down 15%. It\u2019s roughly half in the consumer space, particularly Wealth Management, and half in the corporate space, particularly in Transaction Banking. On the other hand, the net trading income is up very significantly, so a 41% increase; 36% if one excludes DVA with a combination of strong FX activity, DVA benefits, some realizations in Treasury Markets, et cetera. So overall, very, very strong performance in the trading side of it.",
         "Now we have said in the update today that we do expect overall that we\u2019ll see income likely down in the second half of the year, particularly because of interest rates and particularly because Financial Markets, having had a great first half, it will be good to think it would have a similar one in the second half, but the buoyancy of the market may be not quite replicable throughout the second half of the year.",
         "If I move then on to Slide 9. This is having a look at the business from a client segment point of view in the first instance. And if I just maybe focus upon the sort of income growth, so the biggest income growth was in the top block, Corporate & Institutional Banking, up 13%. That is up 9%, even if one takes out DVA, so a big focus upon both income there. Cost control has been great, huge improvement in the jaws and also a big focus upon balance sheet and improving the mix, particularly on the liability front.",
         "The retail and private bank businesses were both fractionally down on a reported basis on income, albeit fairly similar on a constant currency basis. So I think one would say that was a reasonably resilient performance, given the external circumstances in there. And then on the private bank, we\u2019ve got a slight reduction in profit, but bear in mind, there was quite a significant provision release that happened in the previous year, without which we would have seen a slight increase in the profitability in the private bank.",
         "If I move then on to Slide 10. This is then looking at the business from the regional perspective, so Slide 10. So the fastest growth in the income is actually Europe and Americas with a 38% growth, which was particularly strong in the second half of the year. Now given the Europe and Americas is largely a corporate business, corporate side of the business did well, so that is broadly what one would expect. If we can move the slide one by one. The ASEAN region then at an 11% increase was also a very strong performer in the period, and we had particularly noteworthy growth in Indonesia and in India, both of which had roughly 40% increases in income in the period, so very, very strong performance.",
         "Greater China and North Asia at 2% increase. I think that is, again, pretty resilient, given the challenges in that region during the whole of the period. Hong Kong broadly was level on its income. We saw an increase in income in China of about 10%, and the Korea business also had a great run with about a $200 million profit print for the half year. The AME region was a little bit more challenged. We had a minus 6% headline growth, but really, if you think about this, we have the impact of COVID, we have the impact of oil prices, and also, foreign exchange went against us. Without the foreign exchange, the region would have been about 2 percentage points down. So again, I think in the circumstances, not a bad print for the period.",
         "If we could then move on to Slide 11, which is the Central & other. So Central & other, not a lot actually to comment upon here. On the left-hand side, you can see the client profitability, which stayed similar at about $0.3 billion in both periods. A little less profit recognition in Bohai because following the IPO, we\u2019re recognizing the profit there on a slightly delayed basis. But offsetting that, we had some better benefits in the treasury space. And then on Central & other, we\u2019ve moved from small profits to small loss, which is largely about the income in the Treasury Capital business, given lower interest rates.",
         "So moving then on to Slide 12. On the costs, we have, as I said earlier on, had, I think, a good half year on costs, a continuation of what we have been doing previously, a significant improvement in cost jaws and a print on costs, which was very, very similar in both first and the second quarters. We are continuing to invest in the business. We are continuing to digitize the business, and those have been big components of why we\u2019re keeping the costs down at these levels. And we\u2019re reiterating our intent that the costs for the full year this year would be below the $10 billion mark. And indeed, we are putting a lot of focus now into looking at other cost initiatives to endeavor to keep the cost in 2021 also down below the $10 billion mark on the same currency basis as we are experiencing today. So, I think the cost story is a good story.",
         "If I move then on to the credit side on Slide 13. We have got, as I mentioned earlier, $1.6 billion charge for the first half of the year. That is obviously up a lot, as you can see from the top-left chart, compared with the same period last year. And then you can see in the bar charts the sequential movement on that in the middle there. So, we are down by [a 30%], 40% from the first quarter. That reduction is primarily reduction in the CIB space. So the retail business is fairly similar, and CIB was down. And in particular, that was because we have no new significant names appearing in the CIB space during the quarter.",
         "So overall charge is about -- 60% is stage 3 and about 20% on stages 1 and 2 models and on stage 1 and 2 management overlay, which I\u2019ll come on to in a minute. So impairment charge, about 20% of our overall income, higher in the ASA region, about 35%; and about 30% in the AME region; but only about 10% of income in our biggest region, GCNA, and the one which is hopefully moving out of the COVID era first. So I think there\u2019s good progress there.",
         "On the bottom of the chart, we\u2019ve shown again the makeup of the stage -- stages and the categories here. And you can see we\u2019ve had stage 3 go up a bit in the period, about $1 billion. CG 12 has stayed similar, and the early alerts has gone up again. Now in part, that\u2019s because we have now gone through all sectors over the course of the second quarter, and in fact, the earlier numbers peaked in May have come off very fractionally since then. So keeping a close eye on those.",
         "Cover ratios on provisioning, a fraction lower than previously. That is primarily some of the older debts that were fully provided have been written out, and some of the newer exposures that are coming in have got a guarantee and credit insurance in them instead. So overall, we\u2019ve said, if the economic environment remains similar or it doesn\u2019t deteriorate too much further, then we would anticipate that the second half impairment charges should be lower than the first half.",
         "So if I then move on to Slide 14. Slide 14 is just taking one component of the credit impairment charges, these stages 1 and 2. You can see in the first box here, $450 million for the first quarter, and that is pretty much halved in the second quarter to just over $200 million. You can also see there that roughly half of those total charges was driven by the models themselves, and about half of it was from management overlay. So we have applied some discretion, particularly on the retail side, just to reflect that we have got relief measures and loan moratoria periods. And on the corporate side of it, we have got the exposures, the early alerts. So we have taken some caution on both of those fronts, which, in aggregate, is about $300 million for the first half of the year in total.",
         "If I then move on to Slide 15. This, again, is just taking one of the cross cuts of our numbers. So this is the retail exposures on the balance sheet. These are just over 40% of total balance sheet exposures. And I suppose 2 or 3 points here. One is that we are very heavily secured, so 86% of the total is actually secured. Secondly, we have moved quite significantly towards more affluent clients who hopefully will be able to withstand the current period a little bit better. So overall, we have got, I think, the book in a much better state going into this period than what\u2019s the case a period before. Bill will talk a little bit about the relief measures in a few minutes.",
         "So with that, then on to the next slide and the level of risk-weighted assets and the CET1 ratio. So the risk-weighted assets for the half year as a whole came down by $1.5 billion. Now as many of you will recall, we have $9 billion benefit from the Permata disposal, which is the biggest component of that reduction. But on other fronts, we have had some movement up on asset quality, so the grade on the asset side of it. And then we have had some movements on other fronts like the quality of the RWAs, the density of RWAs, which have gone in the opposite direction. So overall, about a $1.5 billion reduction in RWAs.",
         "In terms of CET1 ratio, as I said earlier, that has come in at 14.3%. And again, a number of factors that play into that. Some of that is about the suspension of the dividend. Some of that is about Permata disposal, and some of that is about credit migration. But overall, at 14.3% with strong liquidity, we feel in a good position going into the remaining phases of COVID, and hence, it is good to have a strong capital position, obviously, as we go through the next few quarters.",
         "So with that, let me hand back to Bill."

      "William Winters": [
         "Okay. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks very much for joining me and Andy here for our first half 2020 results presentation. As is our custom, I\u2019ll make a few comments upfront. Andy will then go through a lot of the financial detail. I\u2019ll come back and try to pick up on some of the strategic themes that we have been hitting consistently but also reflect on the current goings-on, give a little bit of a sense of -- our sense of outlook. So, with that, if you could move to Page 3 in your slide deck, coming on our strategic progress to date and also on our performance at a high level. And we\u2019ll be getting into a lot of detail on all these things as we go through the conversation.",
         "First and foremost, it\u2019s very encouraging for us to have gotten to validation of the key strategic priorities that we\u2019ve been highlighting for the past several years. These are things that have been critical for what has been a pretty good first half for us, all things considered. So the -- we know that the economic, the health, the operational backdrop is about as challenging as we could have expected. But our focus on a good, strong network business with differentiated capabilities has allowed us to remain resilient in our corporate business through this period; likewise, a focus on national clients, fairly buffeted by some of the challenges that we\u2019re all experiencing. Nevertheless, it has proved fundamentally resilient, and we think we\u2019ve made actually some good progress in terms of our market positioning.",
         "Looking at the 4 markets that we had called out for optimizing low returns. Very good progress across all 4 of those, and we could include other very important countries like China into that mix. So I\u2019d be drilling into that in some detail. We\u2019ve had a consistent focus on productivity. It\u2019s what\u2019s allowed us to keep our expense base flat for several years now. The shift has moved from just getting leaner and more focused in everything that we do to fundamentally transforming the bank. This, of course, goes into overdrive in this environment, given the income headwinds that we\u2019re experiencing and that we know will continue to present themselves. So now we\u2019re talking about our focus on productivity.",
         "Very good advantage on the digital side, where we\u2019re getting close to the point where some of our key initiatives are hitting the market in full force. We\u2019re very encouraged by the progress that we\u2019ve made and very encouraged by the way that we\u2019ve shifted the mindset in the bank around a digital-first, cloud-first, data-driven business model, which we will be talking about.",
         "And then finally, you\u2019ve heard us refer consistently to our focus on sustainability. There\u2019s never been a more important time as we think about the recovery phase from the pandemic to think about how we do that in a green way, in a sustainable way.",
         "So these strategic pillars for us have been as relevant as they have ever been. Of course, this is happening against the backdrop of enormous economic and health challenges and also increasing geopolitical tensions. So we\u2019re watching what\u2019s happening between the U.S. and China and all the implications thereof very, very carefully. I think we\u2019re navigating that acceptably so far, but we will clearly have more to say if -- as when things develop there.",
         "Performance in the first part of the year has been encouraging. So underlying momentum has been very strong. We started very strong in the beginning of the year with first half income now up 5%, excluding the -- on a constant currency basis and excluding the positive DVA figure. Discipline over cost has continued to remain healthy. That\u2019s led to a 17% increase in pre-provision operating profit, something that I think reflects the underlying earnings capability of our business. Of course, credit impairments were material in the first half, increase of $1.3 billion year-over-year, which is discouraging but not surprising in this environment. Good news is that after a very difficult first quarter, we had a reduction in the second quarter, leading to a first half operating profit reduced by 25% down to $2 million.",
         "We know that we\u2019re facing significant residual uncertainty, economic and otherwise, which makes us very comfortable running above our targeted capital range, so a 14.3% CET1 with very strong liquidity position as well. We think that\u2019s an appropriate place for us to be in this environment. But of course, as things normalize -- and then we\u2019ll be talking about this as well today, as things normalize, we\u2019ll be looking at the right way to both maintain our investments and our growth capabilities but also to return capital to shareholders via various means to the extent that, that surplus exists.",
         "So with that, I will hand over to Andy, and I\u2019ll come back later with some comments on some strategic themes.",
         "Great, Andy. Thank you very much. So if you could turn to Page 18 in our deck. And we\u2019re going to start with a little bit of a review of the way that we\u2019re approaching our communities, our colleagues and our clients.",
         "It\u2019s never been a better time to be a purpose-led organization. I think we\u2019re seeing that quite clearly. We\u2019ve set out a very clear purpose for our organization. We\u2019ve shared that externally. And I\u2019ll just give a couple of call-outs on a few of the things that we\u2019ve been doing.",
         "Maybe first and foremost, in sustainability, the climate change challenges and the other sustainable development goals that we\u2019ve subscribed to have not gone away as a result of this pandemic. If anything, they\u2019ve become much more acute. So we\u2019ve maintained our focus in this area, not just in terms of our own activity, so $2.2 billion of infrastructure-related financing in the sustainability space, together with a significant increase in the level of sustainable deposits that we generated, et cetera. But we\u2019ve been navigating quite strongly in the global community to make sure that we\u2019re set up for a recovery that isn\u2019t just led through fiscal stimulus but rather green fiscal stimulus, which is a key priority for us.",
         "Second is we\u2019ve made a very, very substantial investment in our people. Of course, we\u2019re very proud of about what our colleagues have been able to deliver through this very challenging time, but we know that the world is changing fast and will change even faster as a result of COVID-19. So the whole refueling agenda is critically important. We\u2019ve launched a whole new set of learning tools for our colleagues, primarily online, of course, right now, but being complemented by in-person training when available, but also through on-the-job development. The fact that we had almost 1/3 of our workforce or that a little bit over 1/3 of our workforce spend a significant amount of time on our internal training sites is the clearest testimony we could get to, one, the quality of what we\u2019re offering; but two, the importance in the eyes of our colleagues but also in our own lives.",
         "And third, the focus on community. Of course, it starts with being there for our clients during difficult times. And as Andy mentioned and as I will mention, we have stood by our clients during this challenging time for them. But we\u2019ve also done ways to help in ways that are apart from our core banking business, including raising $50 million from the bank, complemented by significant donations from employees to be used for both immediate and frontline relief, but also as we get into the recovery phase, making sure that the youth, in particular, in our markets are employed -- and employed. And we talked before about the $1 billion program that we set up to provide financing to companies who are fighting the fight against the pandemic.",
         "Yes. As we sort of turn to Slide 19, we\u2019ll talk a little bit about the relief measures that we put in place for individual customers. Broadly, we have markets where we have mandatory programs, markets where we have voluntary programs but with strong encouragement from governments and markets where we have no programs where we\u2019ve taken a voluntary approach, which we think is consistent with the best of the mandatory programs.",
         "Overall, we\u2019ve had about 4% of our retail clients seeking relief. That has translated through to about 8% of loans and advances. About half of the people that sought relief have sought relief from the voluntary programs, and then the vast majority of those are in the ASEAN & South Asia region, where the [indiscernible] have been most persistent and pervasive and where the government programs have been most substantial. The -- under the 8% of loans and advances, $8.9 billion, about 79% of those have come from as a result of mandatory programs; and 89% are current, meaning they were current when they went into the relief program and or they remained current throughout. About 79% of the relief loans and advances are secured, and as Andy indicated, that\u2019s the bulk of our retail lending portfolio in any case. About 2/3 of those are mortgages and with a relatively low loan to value, down at 37%.",
         "But apart from the relief programs, where I think we\u2019ve been proactive and front-footed, we\u2019ve had a number of -- taken a number of steps to be sure that we\u2019re servicing our customers throughout, and that\u2019s keeping our branches, ATMs, call centers open. We\u2019ve been approving over 98% of the relief requests that have come in. And what we\u2019ve seen in the markets that have come out of the pandemic lockdowns earlier, so China and Hong Kong and Korea most specifically, we\u2019ve seen a substantial return to normal, so reduction in delinquency rates and reversal of some of those relief trends. So all in all, I would think we\u2019ve been responsive. We think we\u2019ve been responsible, and we\u2019re encouraged by the degree to which the markets that have begun to recover.",
         "If you move to Page 20. We\u2019ll talk about the similar themes on the corporate side. There are some parallels, for sure. The maybe first comment that only about 3% of our corporate and commercial institutional bank loans and advances have been extended. It\u2019s about $5.6 billion. About a little over 2/3 of that is Commercial Banking clients. Clearly, the segment of our client population is most affected by this. Larger clients have either had access to capital markets or have had cash reserves on which to draw. About 20% of those exposures are in our vulnerable sectors, which we\u2019ve talked about, aviation, oil and gas, etcetera.",
         "So we talk about 5,000 clients looking for support, very skewed to Commercial Banking clients by number. And it\u2019s also interesting to note that the vast majority of these, or 99%, have been in the -- sort of the performing and safe credit grades going into the process. So this is not an opportunity for clients that we\u2019re struggling in any case to take advantage, at least not in a large-scale way, of relief programs that are on offer. About 2/3 of the reliefs that we\u2019ve granted has very short-term exposure. So under 90 days, only 3% over 180 days. So we think that overall, this is very manageable, and we maintained a very good healthy dialogue with clients throughout.",
         "A quick update on the $1 billion commitment that we made. We\u2019ve had great take-up, right, over 100 clients that\u2019s substantially spoken for at this point and almost half funded. A couple of examples on this page. It\u2019s just very -- it\u2019s encouraging, and it\u2019s sometimes even heartwarming to see the uses that our clients are finding to which they could put our money.",
         "The -- if we turn to Page 21, a quick run-through on the network. The clearly more challenging environment, with trade flows down substantially, interest rates impacting our NIM substantially and with economic activity and cross-border investing also impacted, it\u2019s been a challenging period from a pure financial perspective. But we have had good growth from our new and other new sort of next-generation target clients, so up 14% year-on-year. The network income is down about 6%, which we think probably reflects the level of resilience. When we look at our trade volumes, our trade assets are down about 11% year-on-year. Now the market is down about 20%, so it feels like we probably pick up a bit of share there as we did in the cash side.",
         "But the overall challenges on the network side are present. And when we look at the return from this client segment, even in the subdued environment, they\u2019re still quite good. And the underlying trends that we think play to our strengths, including the ongoing opening up of China, which we think will continue to be a theme, we had very substantial inflows into the Chinese debt markets and the bond markets. We\u2019re extremely well placed to capitalize on the changes in our network from which we\u2019ve been positioning so aggressively over the past several years.",
         "We move to Page 22, focus on our affluent clients. A very, very resilient performance. Again, so some of the same macro challenges in terms of inability to market face-to-face to these clients. But despite that, we\u2019ve had an increase in the number of priority clients, up another 2%. Clearly been challenged in terms of being able to convert some of our client growth into net new money, that\u2019s basically flat on the year. AUM is down on the back of market flows. Income is basically flat, continues to be a very nice and high-returning business.",
         "Most importantly, we\u2019ve been experimenting and then now rolled out in full force a whole stream of digital offerings, which have allowed us to maintain a very high level of engagement with these clients throughout. And we\u2019re finding that not only has helped to protect the income growth during the most directly affected period, but also leaves us in a very good position to deal with these clients as they come back into the normal ways of working for them. So overall, encouraged by the resilient results on the affluent side.",
         "We turn to Page 23. We are very happy with the progress that we\u2019re making in these 4 markets that we especially called out 1.5 years ago. We\u2019ve had strong income growth in all the markets with the exception of UAE, which as Andy mentioned, has been particularly hard hit, not just by COVID, but by oil prices, but really phenomenal growth. Some of this is Financial Markets. But even stripping out the strong Financial Markets results, we\u2019ve had very good income growth in India, Korea and Indonesia. Costs are under control and improving in all four of those markets. It clearly was part of the focus on optimization. This has led to $405 million of profit before tax, which is a 7% increase year-over-year despite some of the credit challenges that we all face.",
         "And just a couple of areas to call out. Steady growth in our global subsidiaries business across the board, so dealing with subsidiaries of our large [M&T] customers and key growth in the Priority segment. So again, both very focused on our strategic themes of network income streams and our affluent client base.",
         "We turn to Page 24. We\u2019ve, as Andy commented, steady improvement on the productivity side. A lot of this productivity is coming from digital investments that we made in prior years and from underlying process automation and process improvement. No surprise that the measures of digital sales have increased dramatically during the period. But the productivity figures per FTE or either income or pre-provision operating profit are very encouraging.",
         "As important as doing more of the stuff that is more convenient for customers and more efficient for us, we\u2019re also finding ways to discourage clients from doing the things that are less efficient, so steering them away from the more manually-intensive or paper-based forms of engagement has been a key part of our productivity drive. As we look to the confidence that Andy was able to express about not just this year\u2019s expenses but our targets for next year as well to keep expenses below that $10 million level. This has to do with fundamental business transformation, more than just finding ways to cut out bits and pieces of that. We\u2019ve been pretty good at finding that so far. So this will remain a key area of focus for us.",
         "We move to Page 25. Just a quick comment on the digital side. Again, no big surprise. Mobile and digital adoption are way up, both on the wholesale and the retail side of our business. Mox, which is our Hong Kong virtual bank, is in advanced testing right now with sort of full-scale beta testing. We expect to launch that very soon. Very encouraged by the results.

It\u2019s being recognized by our clients, most importantly, the [indiscernible] who, at various points, rate us best digital bank in Asia, Best Digital Bank in Hong Kong, et cetera.

As you can see, we\u2019ve had a good, healthy uptick since the lockdowns have been relaxed in GCNA, so Hong Kong and China and Korea, which are early in and early out of the pandemic-related lockdowns. The trends are a little bit less discernible on the ASA side obviously, the recovery began a bit later. It\u2019s been more muted, and a number of markets are still in lockdown or have had meaningful second waves like Singapore. But we are encouraged by the underlying dynamism of our clients, the underlying dynamism of our markets and our ability to stay relevant to these clients.",

That, together and driving no interest rates for a long period of time, increasingly the case across our markets, presents us with some real economic headwinds and real financial headwinds. Now geopolitical risks are very present. We\u2019re focused on them to an extraordinary degree. We\u2019ve had no material impact on our business so far as a result of these geopolitical flare-ups. But we recognize that there are elements of escalation that could be impactful for us. We\u2019re prepared for those. We are watching it very, very carefully to the extent that we can influence, and we are ever realistically. These are areas that we can watch and prepare for and respond as appropriate.",

What we can say is that if economic conditions don\u2019t deteriorate materially, and if governments remain as effective as they have been in terms of putting any of the steps in place to avoid the worst of the outcomes from this pandemic, then we would anticipate loan impairments in the second half of the year to be below the loan impairment level in the first half of the year. But there are many, many certainly caveats and possible different scenarios in that regard.",

You looked to have been impacted by about $5 billion of negative credit migration in Q2, which comes on an ongoing basis seems to be maybe a little bit above where you\u2019re guiding at Q1. Should we be thinking about this as the ongoing run rate? Or was Q2 particularly impacted by downgrades in some of the vulnerable sectors maybe? And have you seen any lengthening of the behavioral maturity for customers experiencing stress?",

A very simple annualization of the H1 cost print would seem to point to a number much better than consensus for FY \u201820. What should we be expecting regarding any bonus true-up later in the year, given that H1 staff costs were down about 7% year-over-year, which has been very inconsistent maybe with the market performance? And regarding that guidance for FY \u201821, should we be thinking about the rate of cost growth going forward now being some way lower than inflation? And if I might just slip one just on NII. It\u2019s quite hard to look [indiscernible] 12.5% sequentially. Sorry. It\u2019s down about, I think, 12.5% sequentially despite interest earning assets being up 4%. In light of the move in HIBOR [indiscernible] are you still comfortable with the NII guidance that you gave at Q1?"

So RWA is, as you\u2019ve seen, we had pretty much the benefit of Permata offsetting the credit movement, the volume movement within the book, et cetera. Clearly, going forward, Permata only happens once itself evidently. I would expect we would see some increase in the RWAs over the balance of the year for two reasons: one, we do hope that there are opportunities out there to be lending more; and secondly, credit migration, I think, is likely to be upwards rather than downwards realistically.",
            "Hopefully, we\u2019ve seen more of the credit migration in the early months of the year than we will see in the latter months of the year. But the proof of that will very much be in the efficacy of the lifting of lockdowns in various countries and how that then impacts upon our client base. So I\u2019d expect some increase in RWAs over the period of the year over the balance of the year, but nothing sort of particularly noteworthy.",
            "On the costs, the cost print has been good, as you have seen. We have taken a thoughtful view, hopefully, in terms of staff cost bonuses, et cetera, been accruing for the first quarter and the second quarter, which we\u2019ll continue to do through the balance of the year. I did observe that second half costs do tend to be a little bit higher than the first half. So if you normalize for first half and add a little bit, you do come to a number that is just sub-$10 billion, which is what we are very much targeting for the business going forward.",
            "And then obviously, on the cost, the issue is beyond 2020. We want to make sure that we have got enduring change and enduring projects in the business, so that actually we can keep below the $10 billion number next year but on a more structural basis.",
            "Your third question, I think, was on the net interest and the margins there. Those clearly have come down. We guided at the end of Q1 that with the rate changes, we would see income come down because of interest rates. I think it\u2019s probably fair to say that rates and the curves have flattened a little bit more than we envisaged at that time. It\u2019s always a little bit of a guessing game. If we knew now what we knew then, we might have talked about an $800 million rather than $600 million number for the year, something of that order. But obviously, there are a number of moving effects here. Rates, margin is one. Volumes is another, but in that sort of order. So balance of the year, clearly will have more impact on the interest line.",
            "Worthy of note, I think that over half our income, however, in the first half was not from interest. It was actually from fees and from trading. So it is one part of the overall mix, but it is not now dominant part."

            "Bill, Andy, can I just ask, please, on the question about the sustainability of revenue growth when looking beyond 2020? If I take your guidance for the second half, I think it\u2019s fair to assume that the current consensus of around $15 billion for this year is still intact, but the mix of that looks like being a much lower net interest margin, probably less smaller contribution from Wealth Management and Transaction Banking and a much bigger contribution from Financial Markets.",

So I guess the question is, are you still sort of comfortable with that sort of consensus view of where revenue is going? How dependent is that now on a recovery in NIM at some point? Do you need Financial Markets to continue making a bigger contribution than historically? Or are there other drivers with new clients, et cetera, that you think can pick up some slack? I\u2019m just trying to get to understand of how comfortable you are really with current market consensus."

            "Thanks very much, Tom. Let me take a first pass at that, and I know Andy will have lots more to add. First, the dynamics as we come out of the acute pandemic phase has been already a returned growth in some key product lines like Wealth Management, up through including the month of July, we\u2019ve had a strong rebound in the markets which have been lagging during the pandemic period for all the obvious reasons.",
            "The interest headwinds, by contrast, will not just go away, and then we\u2019ve got reaffirmation from the Fed yesterday that we will be low for long. And no reason to think that HIBOR rates will be different either. So the way for us to get back to where we draw inventory is, first and foremost, to make sure that our transaction volumes continue to pick up speed. And we\u2019re comfortable given the momentum that we\u2019ve had over the past couple of years and the momentum over the past few months now that we can make a material impact on income growth through volume growth. And clearly, our business has become, marginally, as we\u2019ve gone from year-to-year, less dependent on the measures of balance sheet and more dependent on non-financing. And those are the opportunities for us. As we think as the global economy reset, as trade flows re-normalize and as we\u2019re able to continue to press our network income, we think that there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for growth there.",
            "Finally, just on Financial Markets. Of course, the global community, banking community, enjoyed a very robust period in trading markets [indiscernible] And what we don\u2019t have relative to some of the big other capital markets players is a very large U.S. capital markets business and sectorly has been the big driver of our performance in a number of markets, is the -- both the capital markets business itself and also the associated hedging activities. Rather, weaker in general [indiscernible] and for the most part, in our emerging markets. And we think that\u2019s a more sustainable growth and income stream.",
            "So as Andy and I both indicated, it would be difficult to replicate first half of 2020 FM results in the second half of the year or next year. But we do think that there\u2019s a secular growth opportunity for us, and that the investments that we\u2019ve made in that area over the past couple of years are clearly paying off.",

Hopefully, as we are coming out of this year and things are settling more going into next year, I think the volumes on the comparison between next year and this year should offer some upside.",
            "Secondly, Financial Markets may not be as buoyant as it is recently. But unless we are into much calmer territories, I still think that there is going to be a lot of volatility. There will still be a good amount of trading activity around next year.",
            "Thirdly, some areas where we\u2019ve been a little bit weaker since wealth management, I think, would be a good example. Actually, the trends at the moment, particularly in Northern Asia, have been the first sort of region to start coming out of this. We\u2019re not far off January levels now of income. So generally, the trends there are starting to pick up, clearly, with several months to go before we get into 2021. I think there are reasons to believe that there should be some upsides on the volume front as we go into next year. So you put all of that together, and I think we\u2019re there or thereabouts in terms of what we should be going for."

Plus or minus $50 million, I don\u2019t know, as long as it\u2019s below $10 billion by 1, I\u2019m happy with that. I\u2019m even happier if it\u2019s $50 million below or $100 million below. But I think the key thing really is that we need to take the opportunity now to push even harder on things that will digitalize the business. And as a lot of businesses, while reflecting upon the last few months, all that [indiscernible] has been a big area for us over a period of time. I think this renews our focus to do things like that. We are going to constantly look at things we can do to make the business more efficient. And I think having a target out there that is memorable, both externally and internally, is a good coat of arms and we will do everything we can to get to at or below the $10 billion number for next year."

            "So, thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll take it first pass. Hong Kong, obviously, is in quite a severe economic slump. It began last year likely as a result of the civil protests and has continued this year through COVID and the general global economic mode. So the second quarter GDP prints are down close to 10%, are obviously troublesome. It\u2019s not clear that any of that relates through to the U.S.-China tensions, although the general backdrop in terms of economic malaise in the world has certainly contributed to by that level of uncertainty.",
            "So -- but in terms of our clients in Hong Kong changing the way that they would behave, apart from the fact that they were severely disrupted in the second half of last year and into the early part of this year through the protest and on the partial lockdown in Hong Kong and the much more substantial global economic contraction that was pandemic related, that seems to be the primary driver. That gives us some confidence that as some of those headwinds received that Hong Kong will come back to the same dynamic healthy underlying growth.",
            "Just to quickly comment on costs. We might get back on our investments and are trying very, very hard to protect our investments as we go into next year. The investment program for the bank has been very substantial for the past few years. It\u2019s paying off. We\u2019re seeing it in the productivity figures. We\u2019re seeing it in our ability to keep expenses flat or down while income is growing. ",
            "We\u2019re seeing it in terms of some really cutting-edge digital initiatives that will begin to produce revenue in the later part of this year and will pick up speed over the next two or three years. So the investment program is pretty central. But of course, what we will look at and continue to look at is which of our investments do we really need to prioritize in this environment. We\u2019re in a different market. We\u2019re in a different world. And that can certainly involve some repotting or some repositioning some of the investments that we make. But we don\u2019t expect to materially reduce our investment profile. Andy?"

We\u2019ve obviously gone through to have a look at the more discretionary parts of that portfolio. But as Bill has said, we are very, very keen that the things that are structural are strategic. We absolutely keep pressing on with those.",

So it may take $100 million off that number or something like that for the year. We expense half of that, so $50 million.

Is that something you see across your footprint in terms of client activity, that activity levels in -- particularly in Asia, picking up faster than elsewhere? And should that give -- I mean, if I read your comment right or just to follow up on that underlying asset growth, loan growth from here could essentially accelerate, and that\u2019s despite, obviously, the tensions in Hong Kong.",

I appreciate the comment on the higher rate sensitivity as to one of the earlier questions. I was just wondering in terms of the moving parts here, HIBOR being down in the quarter and ending much lower at the end of the second quarter.

And we\u2019ve been very encouraged by the return to something approaching normal, which has involved both a reduction in credit delinquencies but also a return to closer to normal Wealth Management activities, and that is continuing to this day. Obviously, we\u2019re watching what the impact will be in Hong Kong of this third wave that they\u2019re fighting right now, which has resulted in a lockdown as severe as the lockdown that Hong Kong has had so far. So we\u2019ll see. But clearly, there\u2019s a containment capability that\u2019s well understood now, and we\u2019re optimistic that Hong Kong will, in this current spike, under control. Of course, we\u2019re also reminded by this and also by what we saw earlier in the month or last month in Beijing, that history just hasn\u2019t gone away and it\u2019s going to come back up from time to time, and there could be ongoing economic disruptions.",
            "When we look beyond, I would say, Korea, which Andy mentioned, I mentioned as well, has had a stellar performance in the first part of the year. As you know, we had quite a severe outbreak early in the year. It never went into a complete lockdown. It\u2019s had very effective containment mechanisms and has turned to a healthy very healthy level of business activity for us. So these are the role models as it were.",
            "When we look to the Asian markets, we\u2019re obviously hopeful that Singapore follows a similar path to Hong Kong and to China. They are at the core into fighting the nasty second wave of the pandemic, as you know. But we\u2019re also seeing some of the early signs, as I mentioned in my final slide, [indiscernible] with encouraging trends there. The rest of ASEAN is a little bit further [indiscernible]. But the containment efforts have been reasonably successful in places like Malaysia, Vietnam. So we would hope that we would see similar sorts of trends in those markets.",
            "When we go beyond into North Asia, I mean, India and Bangladesh are still -- the pandemic is still very severe. And Middle East is certainly experiencing pressure, not just from the pandemic but from oil prices. And Africa is still at relatively early stage of the containment or the evolution of the pandemic as well. So we see -- I think it\u2019s going to take some time before those parts of our footprint come back to anything close to full speed. And it\u2019s likely that the economic [indiscernible] will be somewhat enduring.",

And it was happening in the U.S. right now, and we\u2019re all careful of the increase in infection activity in Europe as people are moving and lockdowns recede. So we -- but as Andy pointed out, Europe, they\u2019ve been a very strong region for us in the first half of the year, substantially on the back of Financial Markets, which could be [indiscernible], but also in terms of general activity. So I think the western world continues to see the east as an opportunity for growth and is continuing to invest there and to engage in trading and other activity, which obviously plays well to Standard Chartered strengths.

Martin, so on your second question on NIM, I guess, as the rates impact rolls through the book, it\u2019s logical to think that we would see some further reduction in the NIM over the balance of the year, although I think the majority of it we\u2019ve gone through, but there is some further to go. A lot of moving parts, as you referred to. The legal restructuring gives us some benefit. HIBOR coming down has an impact, albeit quite a lot of our lending there is linked to the prime rate. But overall, I\u2019d say slightly lower, but we\u2019ve gone through the majority of the reduction. ",
            "On capital, yes, the printed number of 14.3%, if you take out the effects that are specific to regulatory relief relating to COVID, then 14.2% or something like that is still the number or is the number, but it\u2019s still clearly above the range that we have been trying to operate to in a business-as-usual era. And I think your point on capital returns is an interesting one. Clearly, 2 quarters into COVID to actually have the balance sheet in a position where we are above the range that we normally operate to is a good position to be in. Where it moves from now will be dependent upon 2 things: one is going to be the growth opportunities that are out there to lend more; and secondly is going to be about credit migration, which itself will be dependent on how successful countries are in lifting out of the lockout period. But I think either way, we\u2019ve got good flexibility there. I\u2019d hope that we\u2019d be certainly in the higher end of our range for the full year as we see it at the moment.",
            "Our approach to returns, obviously, at the moment, it is on pause. But generally speaking, it remains as previously, but where there are opportunities to profitably grow the business, that is where we will deploy capital to the extent there is surplus. If having done that, there are opportunities to return capital, then that is what we\u2019ll do, obviously, subject to regulatory approval. But we\u2019ll only do that when we\u2019re reasonably confident that the outlook is a bit more foreseeable than maybe another couple of quarters, 3 quarters on from now, that should certainly be the case. But bottom line, I think coming midway through the COVID era with capital ratios as high as they are, with liquidity as strong as it is, we actually feel that\u2019s quite a good space. And in the next year or so, then obviously, we\u2019ll see how the whole returns position evolves, both for us and for the sector as a whole."

Do you think you will grow revenue in 2021 versus 2020? My second question is a follow-up on NIM, which is tumbling precipitously towards almost being a double-digit NIM at this rate. I wondered, longer term, does it change your thinking about the mix of the balance sheet? Do you think that there is opportunity to deploy some of that excess capital in higher NIM areas, given how much you\u2019ve controlled your credit quality over the course of the last few years, that could grow through mix rather than just hoping for rates to go up?"

I mean, there or thereabouts, obviously, 18 months to go, there\u2019s a lot of water to pass under the bridge. As I said previously, there are reasons why the back end of this year will be under interest rate pressure. There are reasons why next year should hopefully benefit from some volume pickup. And hence, you sort of come back to something that\u2019s relatively stable on the current year. So that was the context there.",
            "On the NIM, I think there\u2019s a variety of things, obviously, that we are reflecting upon. One is the proportion of our activity that is not interest rate related and the focus, particularly on the Financial Markets-type business, the focus upon Wealth Management, the focus upon affluent customer base. The more we can do in those spaces itself evidently is going to be good. We are -- in the interest phase, we\u2019re going to continue to be very disciplined and very thoughtful about returns. We will not push into places where we are uncomfortable that the balance of risk and opportunity is inappropriate. But again, we keep that under review, but I think that is one of evolution of mix of the business rather than a revolution of the business.",
            "So overall, it\u2019s -- I mean this first half, we [indiscernible] noninterest-related sources than interest-related sources, and the more that we think in that sort of activity up or about taking a lot of risks within business, then we will continue to do that."

            "Manus, just a little bit of color for me. We have -- as Andy pointed out in the prepared comments, our retail consumer credit book is substantially secured, mostly mortgages with very low loan to value. So we have a low-risk consumer portfolio, not risk-free as we see, given the loan impairments that we\u2019ve taken, in particular, with the ECL. But we\u2019ve been developing our capabilities quite substantially over the past couple of years to take a data-driven approach to consumer lending on an unsecured basis. And we\u2019ve rolled out a number of discrete initiatives in the year, where the early results are quite good.",
            "In China, where our [indiscernible] mechanism penetrating the unsecured consumer credit market is through a joint venture with Ant Financial, a partnership really with Ant Financial, where we\u2019ve had very good, both credit and return experience in the early phases, and it\u2019s contributed to our China results.",
            "And when we look to programs like the nexus, which I mentioned earlier, as our Banking as a Service model in Indonesia, there will be a substantial consumer lending component to that banking offering that will be delivered through an e-commerce platform, where with the experience that we\u2019ve had in other markets has given that we can have much better credit scoring and also a much better credit repayment characteristics, where we have a significant partner relative to where we\u2019re doing and trying to work ourselves and just relying on [Europe].",
            "So we\u2019re not going crazy. Yes, we\u2019re quite aware of the riskiness of the environment, especially right now. But this is a capability we\u2019ve been building that would allow us to go [build a new strategy], adjusted to your question, might be attractive, which is to have a proportion of our [indiscernible] that\u2019s generally higher returns in a way that is actually playing to some our core strengths."

Because whilst a small proportion of your group revenues, it was actually in the first half of the year accounting for about 15% of the year-on-year growth in reported revenues.

I think one, though, has to look at deposit income as well as the mortgage income to get the overall picture within the business because there are clearly 2 components, money in and money out, to this.

So is it that we end up having a second wave, and GDP recovery ends up being taking much longer than you anticipate?

I\u2019m just trying to work out how you\u2019re sort of thinking about the flex factors.",

            "Sure. Thanks, Nick. I\u2019ll take that. I\u2019ll take the first half of that. Andy will add some color. During the first quarter results, we called out 2, we call it, incremental tail risks beyond what we thought was entirely embedded into our [indiscernible] into our ECLs. And those were the possibility of an extended period of [deferred lower] oil prices. As you recall, at that point, the price was down around $20 a barrel. And second was the possibility that the promised state support from the aviation sector might not be forthcoming. As we go through -- clearly, we see the course of price of oil as a little bit more than doubled. It\u2019s still quite low, but we moved further away from that tail risk. Now it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not there. I\u2019ll recognize how volatile that can be. But we\u2019re further away from the [indiscernible] scenario.",
            "And second, the aviation sector, the industry itself is still under tremendous pressure. The state support that had been muted or discussed has been, to some degree, forthcoming. So a number of flight carriers have either been recapitalized or they have [indiscernible] or other forms of [indiscernible]. So, that particular tail risk like they\u2019re further away than they were when we called them out in the first quarter of this year. When we look at the [indiscernible] it\u2019s the obvious. The big unknown is how consumers were operating their debt payment holidays right now, how they respond to the [indiscernible]. We\u2019ve called out a number of things that are encouraging, with the return to more -- something much closer to normal delinquency levels in China and Hong Kong. But we also know that those are countries where the economic impact is also relatively modest, given the success of containment efforts. That\u2019s not the case in some of our other markets. So we\u2019ll just have to see, and as the data comes in, how our clients in Bangladesh, from India and across Africa responds to the lifting of payment holidays. And we shouldn\u2019t assume that the encouraging results from China and Hong Kong are going to be replicated entirely for those markets. So that\u2019s one incremental stress and sensitivity and uncertainty.",
            "And clearly, on the corporate side, we\u2019ve got largest waves of the [indiscernible] universe that are under cash flow pressure. And the capital markets have been wide open. That\u2019s allowed most of our larger clients to top up their cash reserves to the extent of moving through at all. But the -- to the extent that the economic malaise is extended significantly, we would certainly expect to see some troubles there. We think [indiscernible] provided, given that we have the modeling that we\u2019ve done and the ECL, both the base level ECL and then the overlays that we\u2019ve applied. And of course, the things are [indiscernible] than what we\u2019ve modeled in terms of macroeconomic drivers, then we\u2019d expect to have some incremental losses.",
            "Maybe I\u2019ll -- sorry, India and Indonesia, quickly comment there, and I have a follow on all the above. India has been a big recovery story for us. Obviously, the current environment in India is quite negative. But we\u2019ve been restructuring that business over the past 3 years very aggressively, and we\u2019ve had good growth in our priority client income. We\u2019ve had good growth in our global subsidiaries income. We had a strong first half of the year in Financial Markets as well. We\u2019ve always had a continued demand, a very strong large-cap corporate business. But -- and we\u2019ve done that while consistently [indiscernible] down expenses and reducing our low-returning RWAs by October 3. ",
            "So, this is just a good, encouraging underlying recovery story. India is now, again, a healthy contributor to the group. The -- Indonesia, as you know, I commented and Andy commented as well, we sold Permata. But we have refocused our relatively small retail business on the affluent client segment. And that\u2019s done quite well in the early part of the year. We have a very strong client franchise in Indonesia, which performed well in the first part of the year, and again, Financial Markets were up. But Andy, you have a comment on the credit risks and on the ASEAN markets."

            "Yes. I mean, just briefly, and at risk of repetition, I think the success of lockdowns being lifted is going to be hugely influential in terms of the credit impairment forecast going forward. Quicker it is done, the more businesses that are a bit fragile will survive. The less impairments we\u2019ll have, the more employment there will be. So, it goes without saying that the lifting of the lockdowns, I think, is going to be hugely significant there. India and Indonesia, just echoing what Bill has said, I think it is the sum of many small parts. A lot of things we\u2019ve been doing in both markets over a period of time, the strength in both of them was more on the corporate side than on the retail side but expanded across corporate finance in parts of India. Financial Markets, generally, Transaction Banking was actually strong as well.

Or is it actually just that you think the credit quality in your book is actually just better than where The Street thinks?

Subsequently, we\u2019ve been refining the portfolio. We are reducing our concentrations, improving the percentage that\u2019s investment grade. So we came into this unexpected crisis in pretty good shape. And not perfect shape as we included and showed in the first quarter. Problems do still come up, but we feel very good about the quality of the book.",
            "I can\u2019t comment on the [potentials] sort of what you guys have all built into your models. All what we can say is that with current economic conditions sort of progressing along the lines of what we expect and the level of effectiveness of the government programs to support the economy through the pandemic, we think second half of the year will be below first half of the year. That\u2019s probably about as far as we can probably can go. But what that fundamentally reflects is the quality of our book, the efficacy of our underwriting process over the past couple of years, but also the realization that there will be problems, which is why we\u2019ve taken the step of tapping up our model [figures] with a substantial management overlay.",

Back to the answer to the previous question, if you can say how effective the lockdown lift-off will be country by country, then off that, one could predict slightly more accurately what was going to happen on the credit impairment.",
            "However, it is fair to say that particularly the stage 1, stage 2 provisioning is under IFRS 9 slightly more procyclical. And therefore, [indiscernible] more of those charts earlier is what\u2019s happened in the last couple of quarters. Not [indiscernible] variables obviously have deteriorated over the first half of this year. Let\u2019s hope that they don\u2019t deteriorate as much as we go forward.",
            "The stage 3, the visible exposures is just a little bit sort of up and down. We had a higher charge in the first quarter, particularly because of a couple of situations in the corporate part of the book. We didn\u2019t have new names in the second quarter, which is good. But third and fourth quarter, again, will depend upon just how economies start to normalize over a period of time. So I hope the $5 billion number relative to 2 years would prove to be a very full number and that we could be lower than it, but I think it will be very difficult at this stage to be confident in any predictions on that front."

And as you know, is we\u2019ll follow the discussions that we have with our regulator with the PRA, together with our own sense of what opportunities are, and then as we return capital at the nature of our dividends versus other forms of return, share buybacks or elsewhere. Where we were before the pandemic struck, we were -- had a reasonably predictable dividend against earnings, and we had a stock buyback program which we removed. We\u2019re now above the top end of our capital range. It\u2019s a comfortable place to be, given the uncertainty in the world. But as communicated in our comments, we fully intend to reach 13% to 14% CET1 range when we return to a more normal environment. And I\u2019ll speculate when that time will come. So that -- we will be -- we can give more color on nature of capital return as we get to the point of actually returning capital. But I\u2019ll hand over to Andy for his views."

Number two, where there is money to actually return, then first priority should be to have a sort of continuum on a dividend flow.
