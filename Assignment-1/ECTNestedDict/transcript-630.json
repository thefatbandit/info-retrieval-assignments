         "Hello and welcome to our second quarter conference call. CEO, Rob Peabody; CFO, Jeff Hart; and other members of our senior management team are here to review our second quarter results and then we will take your questions.",
         "Today\u2019s call has forward-looking information and includes non-GAAP measures. The identification of the forward-looking information and non-GAAP measures, the risk factors and assumptions pertaining to the forward-looking information and additional information pertaining to the non-GAAP measures are in this morning's news release and in our annual filings on SEDAR and EDGAR. Unless stated otherwise, all numbers are in Canadian currency and before royalties. We invite you to save your specific modeling questions for our Investor Relations team after the call.",
         "Rob will now begin the review."
      ],
      "Jeff Hart": [
         "Thanks Rob. Production in cash flow in the second quarter reflected the severe drop in commodity prices. The shut-in of cash negative production and the deferral of major projects including West White Rose and Superior. Funds from operations were CAD18 million and this included a negative impact from the realization of CAD274 million in after-tax inventory losses that were recorded in our first recorded quarter results, as well as a first-in first-out FIFO after-tax loss of CAD3 million. Cash flow from operating activities, including changes in non-cash working capital was a loss of CAD10 million.",
         "Net debt at the end of the quarter was CAD5.1 billion, up from CAD4.6 billion in Q1. Importantly, net debt has been stable for the past two months when oil prices and market demand improved. We will prioritize cash towards the balance sheet to reduce net debt levels.",
         "Liquidity at the end of the quarter was CAD4.6 billion, which was reinforced by the previously announced CAD500 million term loan in Q2. In addition, Husky has maintained investment-grade credit ratings, S&P recently reaffirmed our BBB rating, and DBRS Morningstar moved Husky to BBB high which is still well within investment-grade parameters.",
         "As Rob mentioned, we have now stabilized our business in this low price environment by matching our cash inflows to outflows.",
         "CapEx in the second quarter was CAD310 million. This included CAD63 million related to the Superior rebuild, which is expected to be largely covered by property damage insurance.",
         "CapEx will be significantly lower for the remainder of the year compared to the first half as major construction is wrapped up at Spruce Lake Central and the 29-1 field at Liwan.",
         "As previously announced, the West White Rose project has been suspended. We expect Q3 CapEx to be in the range of CAD400 million to CAD450 million, excluding Superior rebuild costs, with Q4 CapEx between CAD270 million, CAD320 million.",
         "Moreover, we have the flexibility should it be required to reduce our annual capital spending to a range of CAD1.2 billion to CAD1.4 billion in 2021, excluding Superior rebuild cost. This is enough to sustain our current downstream throughput capacity of 355,000 barrels a day and hold upstream production at around 260,000 BOE views per day, allowing the lowest margin production to decline.",
         "We'll come out with our 2021 guidance in December, but broadly speaking, our capital priorities are focused on our downstream and thermal operations, with about a CAD1 billion earmarked for the integrated quarter. Looking forward, our number one financial priority in the coming months is to maintain the strength of the balance sheet.",
         "Additionally, we are continuing to work on lowering operating costs and ongoing sustaining capital requirements and have identified approximately CAD150 million in cost efficiencies to-date.",
         "In terms of upcoming turnarounds, the Lloyd Upgrader has -- will begin a scheduled six-week turnaround in Q3, which will include increasing diesel capacity from 6,000 barrels per day to nearly 10,000 barrels a day. And a reminder that this work has been deferred from the second quarter.",
         "Tucker will start a four-week turnaround at the end of the third quarter and in the Atlantic region, the Sea Rose is now offline for its regular 15-day maintenance period.",
         "Finally, the Board of Directors has approved of dividend of CAD0.125 per common share.",
         "Thanks. And now I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions."

         "Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the Husky Energy's Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call and Webcast. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]",
         "I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Cuthbertson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead."
      ],
      "Rob Peabody": [
         "Thanks Dan. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. In the second quarter, we saw the full impact of the demand shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prices and margins were impacted across North America with extreme volatility at times.",
         "In light of the deteriorating macro environment, we move swiftly to stabilize the business by matching our cash outflows with our inflows. This will maintain the strength of our balance sheet in what could be an extended low price environment.",
         "In the actions we took included cutting 2020 capital spending in half by CAD1.7 billion, targeting about CAD150 million in cost efficiencies, reducing capital spending at the Superior refinery, and in conjunction with the Board, lowering the dividend.",
         "With these actions, we were able to reduce our total 2020 projected cash outlays by about CAD2.5 billion compared to the original plan. We also improved our liquidity position with a CAD500 million term loan, ending the second quarter with liquidity of CAD4.6 billion.",
         "In addition, we suspended production that was generating negative cash margins and we made full use of our refining, storage, and midstream facilities to avoid selling distressed production.",
         "Oil prices are ultimately driven by the demand for refined products and with the integrated corridor business, we had a clear window on end use dynamics. As the COVID-19 related shutdowns began to impact U.S. refined product demand in the first quarter, we adapted our operations by reducing our refinery rates. In tandem, oil production was reduced to remain balanced with the downstream demand pull.",
         "We also moved early to draw down our own inventories to create extra space to manage the supply/demand imbalances we could see we're going to emerge. Throughout this period, we have remained disciplined in managing the value chain. The collaboration between the upstream and downstream operations in our integrated quarter, business has been virtually seamless and allowed us to maximize available value capture as market opportunities arose.",
         "For example, by cutting our production to a low level in the second half of March, we avoided negative heavy crude sales at the very low April contract prices. We then entered May at a low production rate limiting sales at the unfavorable May index price.",
         "And as the May spot contract prices improved, we were able to substantially increase production and sell into this rising spot market capturing the widespread between May spot and index pricing.",
         "More recently, demand for refining products has been recovering. We've responded accordingly by increasing and optimizing refinery throughput, while also increasing upstream production.",
         "We also recently started steaming the 10,000 barrel per day Spruce Lake Central thermal project. First oil is expected later in the third quarter. We'll continue to be disciplined in matching production with refined product demand. Our agility allows us to make ongoing adjustments in response to market and price signals.",
         "In this challenging environment, we are maintaining our focus on safety and reliability across our operations. This includes a systematic and controlled approach to safety in all areas of our business, and we remain on track to achieve our key process and occupational safety targets in 2020.",
         "Year-to-date, we have recorded a 38% reduction in Tier 1 and 2 process safety events compared to this period in 2019. In 2019, as you'll recall, was a big improvement over 2018. The total recordable injury rate is lower by 31% this year with a 20% reduction in lost-time incidents.",
         "Now, looking at the second quarter. In the integrated quarter, approximately 80,000 barrels per day of upstream production was shut in at the start of the second quarter. These were primarily heavy oil barrels in our cold, conventional and thermal segments.",
         "With demand for refined products recovering, current production from the integrated corridor businesses around 190,000 barrels per day. Approximately 30,000 barrels a day remain shut-in and the levers are in place to ramp up more in the third quarter, of course dependent on market conditions.",
         "Well, throughput volumes at the Lloydminster Upgrader were reduced early in the second quarter, they've since been ramped back up in line with increased demand. And at the Lloydminster Asphalt Refinery, operations remained at full rates over the whole quarter due to strong asphalt pricing.",
         "Our U.S. refineries have also returned to higher levels of throughput. Throughput at Lima is in the range of 145,000 to 155,000 barrels a day with utilization at both Lima -- at both the Lima and Toledo refineries at about 85%.",
         "We are being cautious not outstrip physical demands and continue to pace our throughput with our product listings. We expect the path forward to be bumpy and will continue to respond rapidly.",
         "In the offshore, our average overall net production was 71,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with an operating margin of CAD265 million.",
         "In Asia, overall production was 518 million cubic feet per day of natural gas or 246 million cubic feet for Husky's working interest. Associated liquid sales were 23,500 barrels per day, which is just over 11,000 barrels a day net to Husky.",
         "Looking forward the 29-1 natural gas field at the Liwan gas project is now mechanically complete. Commissioning work is starting and first production is on schedule for the fourth quarter. Once ramped up, the project will add about 9,000 barrels per day of production net to Husky.",
         "Moving to ESG and our ESG initiatives, we plan to release our latest ESG report which will include climate targets next week.",
         "Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to review our Q2 numbers."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Thanks. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks guys for the rundown. Jeff, I want to come back to the CAD1.2 billion to CAD1.4 billion number and thanks for the -- some clarity there. But I guess the question is, how realistic is this kind of capital number next year.",
            "And I hear you in terms of protecting the balance sheet, but obviously, there's also the business to run as you get into 2022. So any color you guys could maybe add around that would be great?"

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "I'll start and then let Jeff chime in. What I'd say Greg is it's very realistic for next year to operate at those levels. Now, what it does involve is that that covers -- that capital covers all the money we need in the downstream in order to keep all facilities running, stable, well maintained. And then in the upstream, the focus then on the capital would be actually on things like sustaining pads for existing thermal projects.",
            "One of the advantages we have next year, of course, is that we have finished 29-1 on the -- in China. And in addition, of course, on the production side in terms of supporting production at that sort of capital level, we have bought both 29-1 and Spruce Lake Central that are just coming on stream at that time.",
            "So, we've kind of put together the model for that year and it looks like we can -- we could run at that sort of level of capital and with production sustained at close to current levels, a little bit down at around -- say maybe around 260,000 or something barrels a day.",
            "And that would take us through 2021 and we think we could also continue to sustain that into 2022. Of course, at some point here, we want to move to a different mode when the environment supports it, which is -- first and foremost, as you know, our first priority is always the balance sheet. So, just maintaining the strong balance sheet and ensuring ourselves that sustainable going forward.",
            "And then and then of course, we want to allocate money to restoring what I would call a competitive dividend for our shareholders. And then that then opens the door for additional capital spending that could drive growth in future years again."

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, great. I think a way to think about that the CAD1.2 billion to CAD1.4 billion is think of it as a call off on capital and think of it in blocks is really the focus there is on -- for lack of better term, the core of the corridor, so you're really maintaining downstream operations doing a sustainable thermal business and then from there, there's decisions. And that's really if you look at it -- like Rob talked about in Asia, where we're at with 29-1 being complete -- mechanically complete. That's really focusing on a sustainable integrated corridor and then from there, there's further decisions. So, yes, it is sustainable."

            "Okay. Just as a follow-up, but switching gears, you guys are adding a 1.5 barrels of storage I guess at Hardesty on year end. Just curious as to whether that's commercial? And then I know you've got another 4.4 million barrels between Hardesty and Lloyd, is all about operating or commercial? I'm just trying to get a sense as to the thinking behind adding the capacity."

         "Remarks": [

And so, really, that's, that's not all just -- that's the -- through the joint venture, it's not all Husky dedicated storage. So, it's -- there's third-party storage as well in there.",
            "So, I wouldn't look at it as is all incremental to Husky. With roundabout -- I think it's about half, but I'll go back, but effectively, it's the infrastructure investing, operational storage to support us and third-party commitments."

So, here's the request because I can tell you our model is in less than ideal shape right now and the thing we really, really need as we boil through everything has -- is just basically the net back for your bitumen and heavy oil on a dry basis -- dry barrel basis, i.e. not deal bit, it is causing us no lack of frustration to try and get the numbers working. So, anything you guys could do there would be much appreciated."

            "We put some enhancements in this quarter. And we have the information, so we'll take a look at that Greg and make sure we cycle back because we want to make sure that everyone's getting the proper information. So, this is continuous us and we'll continue to continue to move forward."

         "Remarks": [
            "Good morning, guys. My first question is just around again, sort of the next couple years of capital; spend outlook and then trying to square that against your 2019 Investor Day five-year growth plan. I know last year and we haven't had the Analyst Day at this year, but CapEx is obviously expected to be in sort of the CAD3 billion plus type of a range. That's now a lot lower. And I think the production goal at the end of the five years then was 400,000 barrels per day.",
            "Maybe can you just provide some color as to what's changed between those two data points and is there still the goal to reach that 400 -- or some higher level of production at some point in time?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Emily Chieng"
      },
      "18": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, thanks. Thanks, Emily. The way I would think about that, again, is, of course, what changed was COVID-19. I think and the look for product demand and of course, oil and gas prices. And Husky's always been a company that is going to prioritize its balance sheet in tough times, because we want to ensure we always maintain our investment-grade credit rating and we always are in good shape for when these conditions eventually pass. What I'd say in terms of the production goal and kind of the way to think about production at the moment is, we did have a goal, we said looked at, against the CAD60 sort of price assumptions, we have the resource base. We don't see a problem with the resource base in order to continue to deliver projects and growth options to get to 400,000 barrels a day.",
            "However, with the lower pricing, again, we prioritize the balance sheet. And again, I just say the way I'm looking at this right now is that we're going to ensure that the balance sheet remains stable and strong. And that's going to be the first use of all cash coming into the company.",
            "And then I think as we go forward from there, we'll strongly prioritize sort of making sure the dividend becomes more competitive with -- not more competitive so much in our industry since the whole industries, dividends are dropping a lot, but more competitive with what -- I always say, look, we're a mature industry, we should be paying a dividend and it should be a good dividend. And we'd like to get back to that. And then as pricing allows, then we would start bringing back those options to start increasing production again. So, that's the way we're thinking about that."

         "Remarks": [
            "Great, that's super clear. And just one follow-up is just around from the operational cost savings that you've seen to-date. Relative to expectations anyway, you guys do a lot better on the OpEx front. How much of this can we carry forward? And how much is more one-time in nature?"

         "Remarks": [

There's other things that we're working through on obviously, deferrals and interim pieces, but in way too broadly think about that is I see a third is really focused on our onshore upstream in the integrated corridor, really realigning and getting efficiencies on how we operate in cold and Western Canada and streamlining that.",
            "On the corporate side, I'll say just about a quarter of it -- of those overall savings really come from optimizing our IS infrastructure rate reductions and just getting efficient there and make sure we get the best dollar out of our IS in corporate dollars. And then the remainder is really spread through Atlantic and downstream on rate reductions, efficiencies, and logistics and the likes. So, we do view it as sustainable and we'll continue to work it."

            "Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is really around the I&M part of the business. I think historically, you've broken it out. Now, going forward, you have it embedded within your operations. Just wanted to get a sense in terms of how much of that part of the business contributes to the results which came in a little bit better than what we were anticipating?",
            "And if you were able to parcel it out, how much did that kind of contributed -- quantify that benefit for the quarter?"

      "24": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Danny we'll come back with the details on you -- with you, but when you think about it broadly it's obviously with the with the heavy dips that that we saw in, in Western Canada, obviously, the margins on Keystone wouldn't have been impacted by that just simply because the Canadian heavy differential was fairly tight. So, obviously, that was more value attributed obviously into the Lloyd value chain because more of that value was generated in basin in essence and it'd be much the same with our export capacity on the -- in natural gas out of Western Canada.",
            "And you'll see that really both of those in the marketing and other in those two in those segments. And so the way I think most of that value is really driven by our export value and differentials between Canada and the U.S. and all the ultimate end markets and really say we're not a big drive value given we saw production come in and actually more the basin differentials tighten up and so most of that value was actually in basin and look at that marketing and other and really that's where we have our inventory valuations and the trading or the export pipelines.",

         "Remarks": [
            "Great. Thanks for the color there. It's very helpful. Second question is really more of a strategic longer term question. Just obviously, as we were emerging from this kind of COVID downturn, just curious in terms of how you're thinking about how you might run the company a little differently going forward?",
            "I think a lot of it will probably be related to the operational side, but also curious in terms of how you might think about your financial side as well. And just trying to get a sense if there's any incremental challenges or even opportunities that come out of this going forward?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Danny Wong"
      },
      "26": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, good question -- rather broad question. I mean one thing we're going to do is we're going to capitalize on all the learnings that we've gotten through, again, another like a kind of stress test of the business. And that -- and we had an earlier question about retaining cost savings. So, a big, big focus is going to be on how do we make sure these remains structural cost savings and we don't go backwards.",
            "And some of the things that we've been doing, which are pretty fundamental on the operational side, is we've looked really hard at -- especially our more remote operations, if you think about the sea rows. If you think about our oil sands projects, where we have a certain amount of operating staff that are that are housed on site, the logistics of getting them back and forth is quite expensive.",
            "The allowances that need to be provided to those people are quite high and so we have been able to fairly radically reduce the number of people on site in these operations and provide much more service from the center.",
            "So, that is something that it actually yields quite material cost savings and I don't think we'll be going backwards on any of those things. So, those are some of the operational lessons.",
            "We also in the cold, heavy oil business, put a whole new different operating model in place with a lot more central control of everything that goes on in that operation. And again, it really made a step change in the costs in that business. And so again, I think that's structural and we won't be going back on that.",

It's been -- it's served us incredibly well over decades, when -- since we've really started focusing on that and it ensures you're always a survivor at the end of these things. And you can come back and one of the things that's going on here in the background, as painful as all this is, is ultimately, you know, the competitive dynamics in the industry are improving.",

And if it were lower or if it were higher is there any thinking as to how you would potentially adjust that in either of those cases?

But there are things we could invest in there.",

Although, it's got a certain -- it is about 60% or so complete. So, it's not like you're starting from square one. So, it's not a long, long cycle project.

And you got to think is right now you're probably in and around ballpark like CAD11 and you're kind of moodiness arranged between CAD9 and CAD13 as a point of this.

Lloyd, the heavy value chain, either off cost -- of course off costs across the Board, you've brought down quite a bit, but the step down there seem to be fairly material. And I just wanted to make sure given the restructuring of the reporting structure and get a sense of how much of that was organic, versus could any of that potentially reclassification, just as we sort of think about carrying forward some of that strengthen the segment comes cost reduction that seemed particularly strong in the quarter.

Number one is realignment and reassessing all of our coal heavy oil production. We changed our operating model really centralized and just streamlined it and that savings are really starting to crystallize here in Q2 and refocus.",

So, you'll see a little bit of that that's a little bit of transport as you're bringing down the production. And we also just adjusted the upgrade rates down a little bit in the Q as well. But we -- a lot of those are sustainable. Some of them will come back with production as we as we ramp on the thermals.",

I mean, if you go back to last year, unit operating costs to build on Rob's point, unit operating cost in our coal business was in excess of CAD30 per barrel. The step change we've now made in this operating model has taken our operating costs at the moment down to about CAD25 a barrel and we're out looking sort of around the mid-20s and go-forward operating costs.

And I think it's important to recognize that part of the reason why we had quite good realizations on the heavy oil in the integrated corridor this quarter was because of performance across the whole integrated value chain, which of course brings netback back to the fact of the heavy oil barrel. And so just because you don't see I&M split out separately anymore, there's still quite a lot of good activity going along -- going on along that value chain.",

            "And that did create for us some opportunities along the corridor. So, I think if you just look at -- if you modeled only, the flat price, the indexes, and the spreads, you would come to a lower netback than what we actually realized and some of the reason we improved on that, or we did better than that is because we were able to make some storage plays, some swap plays, some changing of crudes that we shipped on the pipeline, and really use our integrated value chain assets along the way to add to the netbacks that we received for the heavy oil."

So, I think when I look at the statistics for the overall motor fuels demand in the U.S. and lower 48, we were pretty lucky in our location of our refineries that the U.S. Midwest was never suffered quite as deep a demand destruction I think as the Coasts did, even in the depths of the trough back in April and May. Still we had our refineries turned down to the 60% level for a time.",
            "Since then, we've come back we're now running in the 80% to 90% utilization rate, which I think is a bit on the high side for the overall U.S. refining complex right now and for third quarter, Manav, I mean your guess is as good as mine, we're watching very, very closely the traffic patterns in the U.S., traffic patterns in our markets. We seem to be right now kind of stalled in that 80%, 90% range and we're hoping demand continues to recover.",

We're going to calibrate the whole refinery throughputs and really the throughput of the whole integrated value chain to where demand is and not get ahead of ourselves.

So, we just do those calculations on an ongoing basis and that's the basis we make.",

And again probably like the premier, I think it ignores the facts and it ignores all the tremendous work that's going on in the industry to lower emissions intensity as well as our aspirations as an industry which I think we're making great progress on, to ensure that the oil from the oilsands is just as competitive from a carbon intensity point of view that of any other sort of supplies that you can get after. Very specifically, it doesn't affect Husky, we don't do any business with Deutsche Bank at the moment and haven\u2019t for a long time.",

Also some other targets around diversity and then covers a whole spectrum of ESG issues. And again remind everybody that, well, people talk about ESG and people get focused on climate intensity -- or carbon intensity, in almost all other ESG metrics, Canadian production is lightyears ahead of most production around the world. It benchmarks at the very top of ESG metrics.",
