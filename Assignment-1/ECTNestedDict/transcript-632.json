      "Andy Dickinson": [
         "Thank you, Johanna. I will briefly review the financial terms of the transaction, and then we will turn to questions.",
         "As indicated in our joint press release, Gilead and Immunomedics have been entered into an agreement, pursuant to which Gilead will acquire Immunomedics for $88 per share for a total purchase price of approximately $21 billion. We expect to commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Immunomedics\u2019 common stock in the next two weeks.",
         "The tender offer is not subject to a financing condition, and we expect to fund the acquisition with approximately $15 billion of existing cash and approximately $6 billion in newly issued debt. We expect to retain an investment-grade credit rating following the transaction. The transaction does not alter our stated capital allocation strategy, including our commitment to further develop our internal and external pipeline, as well as our commitment to maintain and grow our dividend over time.",
         "Once completed, we expect that the acquisition will substantially accelerate our revenue growth through the mid-2030s. We also expect that the transaction will be neutral to accretive to our non-GAAP EPS in 2023 and significantly accretive thereafter.",
         "Finally, we plan to update our financial guidance after the closing, which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. We will now open the call to questions."
      ],
      "Daniel O\u2019Day": [
         "Well, thank you, Doug, very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Really, thank you for joining the call, especially on a Sunday.",
         "I speak on behalf of the entire leadership team, we\u2019re very excited to share this news with you today. It really is a transformational acquisition that gives us tremendous potential to help patients with cancer and generate significant value.",
         "So on today\u2019s call, we wanted to articulate the why behind the acquisition for Gilead and provide, obviously, the opportunity for any questions that you may have.",
         "So I\u2019ll start out, and then I\u2019ll pass the baton over to Merdad to talk about the potential of Trodelvy. Johanna will then offer some insight from a commercial perspective. And then finally, Andy will speak to the structure and the financial terms of the transaction.",
         "So as all of you know, we set a strategic ambition at the start of this year to deliver more than 10 transformative medicines and therapies to patients in areas of high unmet medical need. And as part of those efforts, we\u2019ve been building a robust and diverse oncology portfolio. In fact, we\u2019d already completed 12 key deals in oncology in the last two years, including the acquisition of Forty Seven.",
         "Now upon closing our acquisition of Immunomedics, we are fast forwarding our plans to build a substantial oncology business with significant potential. I mean, really, the shape of the portfolio changes really significantly with this acquisition.",
         "Trodelvy has tremendous potential, and we saw some of that in the standout data for triple-negative breast cancer that led to the accelerated approval. This medicine is highly innovative. It\u2019s an antibody drug conjugate that has shown really demonstrable efficacy in an area of very high unmet medical need. In particular, the top line results that Immunomedics shared in July from its Phase III ASCENT study provided significant evidence of clinical benefits and confirmed findings from previous studies around the safety and efficacy of Trodelvy.",
         "Trodelvy met the primary end point of progression-free survival. Trodelvy also met the key secondary endpoints, including most notably, overall survival as well as objective response rate.",
         "I\u2019ll also highlight that we have reviewed significantly more clinical data on the product over the past several months that gives us greater confidence in the clinical benefit Trodelvy can provide. Some of that data you\u2019ll be seeing at the upcoming ESMO conference this coming weekend, and I know that Immunomedics looks forward to sharing that with you.",
         "On the commercial side, although the launch is still early, the response from physicians and patients have been very encouraging in triple-negative breast cancer. We expect increased uptake among this group of patients through our dire need of new treatment options.",
         "While it has already begun to play an important role in triple-negative breast cancer today, we also recognize the promise that Trodelvy potentially offers from many other groups of patients. We\u2019ll work with Immunomedics to continue to explore its potential in earlier lines of therapy and in other solid tumors, both as a monotherapy and in combination. I mean it\u2019s really a pipeline and a product when we think about this from an oncology perspective.",
         "If we look at Trodelvy in the context of our overall oncology portfolio, after closing the transaction, we\u2019ll be adding a transformative cornerstone therapy that gives us an immediate presence in solid tumors. We are gaining the considerable talent and expertise that Immunomedics has in this field and a first-in-class marketed product. This accelerates our expansion into solid tumors and builds on our existing strengths in hematologic cancers through our combined Kite and Gilead pipeline.",
         "From a financial perspective, following the closing of the transaction, Trodelvy will immediately contribute revenue and will significantly enhance our growth prospects in the near term and longer term. We expect the acquisition to create significant value for our shareholders. The transaction reflects the potential value as well as the synergies it brings to our existing platform and our future pipeline.",
         "And finally, let me say that we\u2019re looking forward to welcoming the team from Immunomedics to the Gilead family. The kind of achievements that they have made with Trodelvy are only possible when you have really talented individuals in place with strong expertise and commitment. We feel very fortunate that we\u2019ll have the opportunity to benefit from their talent and expertise at Gilead as we continue to build a strong presence in oncology and work to make a positive impact on the treatment of cancer.",
         "Finally, I want to thank all the talented Gilead and Kite teams for their critical work on advancing our pipeline of medicines in oncology and in virology and inflammation. I\u2019m proud of our momentum. I\u2019m proud to be a part of the team, which I now look forward to building on today\u2019s acquisition.",
         "So with that, let me turn the call over to Merdad. Over to you, Merdad."
      ],
      "Douglas Maffei": [
         "Thank you, Dilem. We appreciate everyone joining us on short notice for today\u2019s call to discuss the exciting acquisition of Immunomedics announced earlier today.",
         "The speakers on today\u2019s call will be Daniel O\u2019Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Merdad Parsey, Chief Medical Officer; Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer; and Andrew Dickinson, Chief Financial Officer.",
         "Before we begin, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those referred to in any forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are contained within our joint press release, presentation and latest SEC filings of each company.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Dan."
      ],
      "Johanna Mercier": [
         "Thanks, Merdad. So I really echo the excitement around this acquisition as well, especially from a patient need perspective. There is clearly a very significant unmet need for new treatment options in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer that improves survival for patients. Later line triple-negative breast cancer is currently primarily treated with conventional chemotherapies and outcomes, of course, as Merdad was mentioning. The remarkable top line results from the ASCENT study in third-line patients has understandably generated significant enthusiasm by both physicians and patients. Full results will be shared later this week at ESMO. And this enthusiasm should only continue.",
         "Trodelvy\u2019s strong efficacy profile has led to early adoption in both academic and community settings since its commercial launch in late April with",
         "$20 million net sales in the first two months of launch. This rapid launch uptake in a challenging environment of a pandemic, speaks to the strong science and the flawless execution of the team. The field force has been very focused in its early efforts on the top 150 breast cancer accounts in the U.S., in which penetration has exceeded 80% and continues to grow. We really look forward to supporting and expanding the successful launch in triple-negative breast cancer, preparing for an imminent launch in Europe and maximizing Trodelvy\u2019s potential across multiple solid tumor types and establishing a global footprint.",
         "So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Andy for the quote."
      ],
      "Merdad Parsey": [
         "Thanks, Dan. And I want to start by saying that I\u2019m also -- it\u2019s been very impressive to see the growing body of data, both scientifically and clinically, supporting the use of Trodelvy. The Phase III data from ASCENT really reinforce the promise of Trodelvy\u2019s unique ADC technology and validates the promise of the Trop-2 targeting therapy. Clearly, this a groundbreaking medicine and, in particular, in an area of high unmet need that represents a new standard of care in this disease.",
         "And following this closely, it gives us the foundation we need to build a presence and a pipeline in solid tumor cancers. The importance of this agent is further reflected in its targeting of Trop-2, which has shown over expression in multiple tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer, urothelial cancer, hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and others.",
         "Let me specifically pick up on one of the themes that Dan mentioned around unmet need. Despite available therapies, triple-negative breast cancer remains difficult-to-treat tumor that disproportionately affects younger women and has poor outcome. The transformative nature of Trodelvy is reflected in the FDA accelerated approval based on the Phase I/II trial. And in that study, we saw an impressive 33% overall response rate compared to the standard of care chemotherapy response rates that were less than 20%.",
         "The confirmatory randomized Phase III ASCENT study in TNBC patients who were patients who had received two or more prior therapies for metastatic disease further demonstrated the benefit of the drug. In particular, it\u2019s notable that this study was stopped early due to the compelling efficacy seen with the progression-free survival signal of 5.8 months compared with the control arm of chemotherapy of 1.7 months. This had a p-value of less than 0.0001.",
         "Importantly, Trodelvy was generally well tolerated in this study with the most common adverse events being neutropenia and diarrhea. Additional data including the overall survival data that we\u2019ve had the opportunity to review during our diligence will be available at ESMO this coming week. The data for Trodelvy suggests that it\u2019s a potentially transformative therapy in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.",
         "Importantly, upcoming clinical trials will also explore the potential benefit across a range of expanded tumor types in earlier lines of therapy. The potential breadth of Trodelvy in solid tumors is really compelling prospect for us in terms of expanding the benefit to other patient groups. Importantly, this includes a pivotal Phase II study called TROPHY U-01 in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer following prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.",
         "We look forward to multiple presentations at the upcoming ESMO Congress. And this will highlight some of this work as well as other work, exploring potential combinations with PARP inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors.",
         "Let me hand off the call now to Johanna."

            "Thank you very much and congratulations on the transaction. A couple of questions for you, Andy. Andy, looks as though a consensus as for Trodelvy is heading towards $4 billion. What revenue do you think is a sort of good breakeven hurdle for the $21 billion purchase price?",
            "And then could you advise us on what sort of cost of capital you think is appropriate for a transaction such as this with an approved product in the current economic climate, obviously, you have terrific access to the capital markets.",
            "And then lastly, Merdad, could you talk a little bit more about the combination opportunities for example, the PD-1, are you going to study it with Zim, the PD-1 from Arcus? And then do you have plans to study it in combination with the CDK4/6? And have you had any discussions about particular candidates?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Geoffrey Porges"
      },
      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks, Geoff. As for the revenue opportunity, we agree that this is a very substantial opportunity across not only breast cancer but other solid tumor indications over time. We\u2019re not providing specific revenue guidance, as you would expect, but we see a very significant opportunity with a number of ways to win, as you heard from Dan earlier, and we\u2019re happy to talk about it in greater detail.",
            "On the cost of capital, we look at cost of capital in the same way as other companies of our size. We look -- in a transaction of this nature, we look at the transaction across a range of discount rates. We look at our cost of capital which hovers somewhere around 6% or below today. But our hurdle rate is higher than that, Geoff, even though we don\u2019t provide specific guidance.",
            "We also look at transactions, as you know, based on the target assets weighted average cost of capital. And looking at it in any way, we get to a place on intrinsic value where we\u2019re very comfortable with this acquisition and believe that it will deliver substantial value for our shareholders\u2019 over time.",
            "With that, maybe I\u2019ll hand it off to Merdad."

         "Speaker": "Andy Dickinson"
      },
      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, Geoffrey, thank you for the question. And you\u2019re right, I think we do believe that there\u2019s a lot of potential here for combination. And I would think about combinations very broadly here. Depending on the tumor type and the stage of therapy, I think it\u2019s important to note that, that would probably entail different sorts of combinations in those settings. Having said that, the data for combinations with checkpoint inhibitors as well as for PARP inhibitors are very interesting to us. And certainly, having Zim provides us a lot more flexibility in terms of designing studies to look at combinations across tumor types. So without a doubt, we\u2019ll be looking at that.",
            "Again, a lot of that is going to be driven by the tolerability profile of Trodelvy, and we think that really lends itself to those sorts of combinations, which is something we\u2019re excited about."

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Two questions. Can you maybe talk about your assumptions or thinking or confidence levels around the major indications that you ascribed in your thinking about the valuation in the $21 billion, breast, bladder, et cetera, et cetera?",
            "And then related to that you made a comment about having seen additional data that The Street hasn\u2019t seen. Can you just talk to that, particularly as it relates to the HR positive Phase III breast cancer study and anything in the basket study?"

         "Speaker": "Michael Yee"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Michael, why don\u2019t I start, and then I\u2019ll quickly turn it over to Merdad. But I think in terms of the assumptions around the major indications, and Merdad can color this a little bit. I think it also gets back to the previous question around the multiple opportunities to have benefit for patients and also for revenue and shareholders.",
            "Clearly, the near-term opportunities, well, the opportunity in our hands, that is, of course, triple-negative breast cancer and the ability to move up in line in therapy there. But then closely behind that is both bladder cancer data that you\u2019ll see at ESMO and then also the hormone receptor positive data that is underway right now. And then one step maybe slightly the next step from those three indications is lung cancer and then beyond.",
            "So I would just say that in terms of our assumption base, there\u2019s obviously lots of assumptions that you can get into by looking at the early data and try to project that to the later data, but we also know in oncology that particularly sometimes those play out and sometimes those don\u2019t play out. So I just want to make sure that you understand that we\u2019ve looked at this in binary scenarios by indication as we looked at intrinsic value as well and obviously, moving up to earlier lines of therapy.",
            "I\u2019ll let Merdad speak a little bit more about -- you can fill in on the assumption side, if you like, Merdad, or also the additional data."

      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, Michael, I think Dan pretty much said everything I was going to say. I think our -- obviously, triple-negative being -- with the accelerated approval is at the highest part of our confidence level. I think breast cancer, more broadly speaking, also, as you see the data we\u2019re very excited about, and we think we have a -- it can really impact some patient care there. And so those are at our highest list.",
            "I think for the urothelial cancer as well, we\u2019ve seen really promising data. And as you get further down into like non-small cell, there\u2019s less data, of course, but we\u2019re impressed by all of it across the board, and we think there\u2019s promise there.",
            "I can\u2019t speak obviously to the embargo data that we\u2019ll show at ESMO this week. But I think as you see those data and you see the combination data as well, I think you\u2019ll start to see sort of where our excitement comes from in terms of building this -- the base for this molecule."

And as you can imagine, we can\u2019t tip our hat to that at this stage. But we had a really good thorough look at this price. It\u2019s important to note that we started this partnering process almost six months ago. And of course, we\u2019ve developed a really nice relationship with Immunomedics over that period of time, and data has become available over the last six months that we\u2019ve been able to be exposed to on due diligence and confidentiality, and that\u2019s only increased our enthusiasm around the potential here."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Let me just take the second question while Andy, you take the first. I think it\u2019s really important to note that there was no connection between this and the CRO of filgotinib. But let me first address the CRO of filgotinib by saying that clearly, as often happens, you see regulatory authorities in different countries taking different decessions on filgotinib in the CRO. And we\u2019re fully committed to continuing to explore and understand better the CRO with FDA and see where that leads us. But that has nothing to do, of course, with our desire to expand our transformational medicines either continuing in inflammatory disorders or virology neuro oncology. So this was part of our broader objective to deliver more than 10 transformative medicines over the next 10 years.",
            "And we started, as I said, well before we actually knew the regulatory process of filgotinib. But what started the discussions, what we knew of this agent, of course, quite long ago, and the discussion started, as I said many months ago as well.",

Prior to the transaction, if you look at most analyst assumptions, which were generally consistent with our internal model, we had well over $40 billion of total firepower with the cash and the financing capacity that we had. So we\u2019re using a reasonable chunk of that here, but we have significant fire power going forward.",
            "I mean the other thing I would highlight is you don\u2019t do a $21 billion deal every year, right? So we absolutely have the capacity to continue to do ordinary course business development transactions. Transactions similar to the Forty Seven transaction. We have plenty of cash to support and grow our dividend over time, which is really important to us as well. So we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are on a pro forma basis after closing of this transaction. Thank you."

         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Look, I think the -- it\u2019s really important that you understand that we\u2019re following our strategy which has two elements to it as its core. Number one, we believe that we want to continue to building on our scientific base we have in the area of virology and also inflammatory disorders and immunomodulatory disorder, and that lends itself to cancer and inflammation. And I think we\u2019ll follow the science. In other words, what\u2019s most important to us is that we can make a transformational difference to patients and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re driven by.",
            "So personally, I think the three pillars we have in our business. We\u2019re certainly not -- let me just say, we\u2019re certainly not done with HIV, right? I mean we have more to do there. We\u2019re excited about the capsid inhibitor. We have lots of research activities going on there in virology and beyond that. Of course, you\u2019ve seen the benefit of that for emerging viruses with a medicine like remdesivir. Likewise, inflammatory disorders, we have a large investment both in-house with our partners like Galapagos that we\u2019re firmly committed to.",
            "And then finally, now, this gives us a third leg in oncology and hematology. It\u2019d be hard for me to imagine or to project in five years or 10 years the size of any one of those pillars because that will be driven by the uncertainties of science and how we\u2019re going after the unmet medical needs. But it\u2019s really important that you know that we\u2019re firmly committed to all three of those areas, which is why the previous question on acquisition capacity and our ability to continue to flush out those areas as the science evolves is important. We will remain focused on that and very importantly, bringing in the best talent from outside into our company to be able to make those decisions.",

They want to come to companies that have on market products that are near term plus highly innovative things that are earlier term. And with this portfolio, I think that gives us a great human capital attraction as well, but all 3 areas we need that human capital in."

Obviously, Immunomedics has the first mover, you guys had the first-mover advantage, but there are competitors there.",

And Merdad, you can also -- but I think on this balance between investment in hem/onc versus solid tumors, again, you should hear directly from Merdad on this, but I think the point is we\u2019ll follow the science. So I think wherever we think we can have the biggest impact on patients is where our investments will go. And Merdad is putting together a portfolio group and committee and decision-making process of Gilead that\u2019s complementary to the one at Kite that allows us to kind of make those investment decisions based upon data. And so I think it\u2019d be hard to predict what the split will be between those two.",

And rather than sort of saying we want a certain percent hem or a certain percent solid tumor, as Dan said, we\u2019ll follow the science and go after the place where we think we can have the biggest impact. So we don\u2019t have a quarter we\u2019re trying to fill or anything like that.",

            "Certainly, for the in-class competition, we\u2019re excited that we\u2019re out ahead, and we\u2019re further along and obviously approved with accelerated approval. I don\u2019t think we can be complacent about that, and we\u2019ll have to continue to explore the molecule as aggressively as possible to show the benefit of Trodelvy in various patient populations.",
            "And then more broadly in different tumor types, we -- I think what we can bring is an orthogonal approach to some of the other approaches people are taking in those tumors and hopefully add to them as we -- and hopefully move up in lines of therapy so that we can look at unique combinations, as we\u2019ve mentioned, things like PARP inhibitors in some tumor types, maybe I/O in other tumor types. And I think that allows us to move up into earlier lines of therapy. So we\u2019ll be looking at that very broadly in order to maintain our competitive edge, both in class and outside of class."

And obviously a very strong start. We\u2019ve also seen some pretty powerful data around, not only the awareness of Trodelvy in the marketplace with oncologists that treat breast cancer, but also their intent to prescribe. And I think what we\u2019re seeing is a really nice ramp-up, and that\u2019s really kudos to the Immunomedics team for making sure that happens in such a quick time both from a physician education standpoint, but also from an access standpoint, making sure that there\u2019s no barriers for patients. So I think they\u2019re off to a very strong start.",

So I think we\u2019re excited about that, let alone the fact that the intent is to file a submission in Europe early next year and obviously follow-up very quickly in Europe and beyond that to really maximize the opportunity with a global footprint that Gilead already has. So I do think that the opportunity from a launch uptake over the next 18 to 24 months are quite large."

So should we think about you expanding the breadth of the kinds of products you\u2019d like to bring in?"

            "But I think on the second one, I\u2019ll give you my viewpoint and Merdad as well can give you his. I think of course, we continue to remain interested on the cutting-edge aspect of oncology and a great deal that is in immuno-oncology today, which has been our focus based upon some of our scientific background in immunomodulation, which has some links back into virology and other scientific foundations we have at the company.",
            "Having said that, we\u2019ve always said that we would remain opportunistic on adjacencies. And I think this is a very connected mechanism versus I/O and our opinion. Scientifically, of course, it\u2019s targeted towards Trop-2 expression. It\u2019s broadly applicable to solid tumors. And because of its profile, we think it\u2019s combinable, of course, not just with I/O but could very well be one of the biggest factor is could be combinability with I/O. So I think it really fits into our strategy, number one.",
            "But number two, to your point, it could have as also our strategy, right? The strategy should never be set in stone. And a lot of our experiences, many of us have decades of experience in oncology strategy. One thing you know is you\u2019ve got to stay nimble and ready to kind of move and rotate. Reminds me of the old ADC days that Genentech and Roche, we had dozens of ADCs that we thought after Kadcyla, were just going to come pouring out. And the story there was that it wasn\u2019t quite as easy to get an antibody linker and toxin to be -- to hit that sweet spot of efficacy and safety, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so impressed, by the way, with what Immunomedics has done with Trodelvy.",
            "So I think bottom line is that, yes, we\u2019ll continue to focus on I/O. Yes, we have great modalities in-house on cell therapy and noncell therapy, and those are building. And I think this may have us rethink how we are inclusive in our oncology strategy of other modalities and other mechanisms. So stay tuned on that.",
            "I mean, clearly, with this being such a potential foundational molecule for lots of tumor types, not only within Gilead, but also outside of Gilead, we\u2019ll continue to look for partnership opportunities. And certainly, Immunomedics already has a line of folks that are interested in looking at combinability of their agents with Trodelvy. And nothing on that will change as we go into the next phase of Trodelvy\u2019s growth. Merdad, please."

            "As far as the comparison that [Indiscernible], I think, look, certainly, the data continue to evolve. What we\u2019re excited about is that Trodelvy brings a very different safety profile as well as efficacy, right? So I think it\u2019s important to look at both sides of that. And so we\u2019re fairly confident that data mature that there will be a role for Trodelvy that would be complementary to that for the competitor molecules in this space, primarily because of the difference in tolerability. I think there\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a very different profile. And I think in this -- especially if you think about some of the more frail patients in urothelial cancer, that difference in the average event profile may afford patients are really great choice in terms of treatment options there. So we think there\u2019s differentiating effect there from the safety standpoint as well as efficacy."

I think Immunomedics has a good coverage today across the United States. I think there might be some opportunities to potentially expand and even leverage some of the work that\u2019s going on with Kite as well since their -- Kite is very well-established in the academic setting. And so the interplay between academia and community is going to be very important. And right now, the split is about 70-30; 70 community, 30 academic is where they\u2019re looking at their current business. And I think there\u2019s probably an opportunity to continue to evolve that.",

I do think we have previous models of what an oncology footprint would look like in Europe, and it\u2019s a little bit of a different setting than in the U.S. But I think we feel confident that we can ramp it up pretty quickly over the next few months as we look at the model and the timing, of course, both for regulatory approval. But as you know, reimbursement takes a little bit longer in many markets.",

So the U.S. pricing assumptions were a little bit easier and, of course, as we look at the outlook, we\u2019ve been just as conservative about our outlook as we look at our own product portfolio and applied similar assumptions. Similar within the U.S. and also outside of the U.S. as we think about Europe, for example. Hopefully, that addresses. I don\u2019t know, Dan, do you want to add anything to that?"

            "And we\u2019ve said that and we factored in every scenario in the U.S. for any of our products? No. I remain convinced that A, we need reform on drug pricing in the United States and B, we have to make sure that patients out-of-pocket costs are the things we target, and that we, most importantly, see reward innovation. And I remain convinced that we\u2019ll get to those types of policies. We\u2019ve been rolling our sleeves up, and we\u2019ll get there.",

And I, for one, really like the profile of this medicine as we approach whatever reforms may happen, not only in the United States but everywhere in the world because this really does have a very significant impact on patients.

            "Congrats on the deal. Quick question. So your previous communications, I mean the goal was to build the pipeline with some small bolt-on acquisitions. And this seems a little bit bigger than that. So just wanted to get your thoughts on what changed the thought process here? And has it anything to do with the filgotinib action by the FDA?"

            "Yes, Dan O\u2019Day here. So I mean the answer to the question is no, it has nothing to do with filgotinib. And what I would say is that I think this is very consistent with the strategy we laid out when I came in about 1.5 years ago with the team here, which is to be disciplined about our scientific areas of strength and where we\u2019re going to play and where we\u2019re not going to play. And then secondarily, to do that with small- to medium-sized bolt-on acquisitions.",
            "So I mean given our market cap and ability, I think this clearly called sweetly into the medium-sized bolt-on. It\u2019s particularly important because it\u2019s derisked from the standpoint of having on market and approval to regulatory. So that\u2019s obviously why it becomes for of a mid-sized bolt-on.",
            "But strategically, as we\u2019ve talked about before, very much in line with our strategy. And I think you can expect to see us do more of this. Now as Andy said, I mean it\u2019s not every day we\u2019re going to do a $20 billion acquisition. We do have sufficient firepower still to put to work, and we\u2019ll keep the threshold high on innovation.",
            "The other thing we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll continue to be creative in terms of our transaction structure. I think Andy and the team have been really creative about finding ways to partner with companies that allow each party to share the risk more fully until you get data, particularly on the earlier stage compounds or some of the innovative type structures we\u2019ve created but a very long-term research-based and development based initiatives like we\u2019ve done with Galapagos on a very sizable basis or Arcus recently on the oncology basis.",
            "So I think making sure that we continue to pivot and have a really fit-for-purpose approach on our strategy as we think about small, medium-sized partnerships, acquisitions. You\u2019ll continue to see us do that. And that I think that takes a lot of work. It takes relationships. It takes knowledge. It takes know-how. But at the end of the day, I think it\u2019s the best way to make sure that you\u2019re whatever -- whoever your partnering with or acquiring, but the innovation stays intact and complete because at the end of the day, it\u2019s about people it\u2019s about getting them motivated and different structures are required to get us there.",
            "So this is a medium size, and it\u2019s transformational for our oncology business. But I think what you\u2019ve seen in the past, you can continue to expect to see in the future."

            "I have a few today, if I may, and I would appreciate you bearing with me on these. First, Dan, I don\u2019t think anyone will question the quality of the asset or the strength of clinical data for Trodelvy. But the same asset with much of this clinical data across indications was trading at less than 20% of the acquisition price during most of 2019. So how should we think about that, especially also from a capital allocation perspective from Gilead, number one?",
            "Merdad, a couple for you. I\u2019m curious, what do you think about Daiichi\u2019s Trop-2 ADC, especially since it only needs 1 infusion per cycle, not 2. And also if you could speak to the response rate in no or low Trop-2 expressors, both in UC and HR-positive breast, and what percentage indication is that?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, Umer. We always appreciate your questions. I\u2019m happy to take them. So on the first one, just to put your question into context, and I think it\u2019s not uncommon to see share prices drop point you have remarkable clinical data. But particularly in the ADC space, given what I said before about the whole of many companies and academic centers being littered with ADCs that didn\u2019t show their promise, it\u2019s not uncommon to be skeptical until you see clinical data. At the end of the day, clinical data trumps, I think, everything. And so of course, we saw an appreciation of the share price based upon the clinical data that\u2019s been publicly made available so far.",
            "And then I remind you, in terms of what Andy said before, we look at this from an intrinsic value basis. Premiums can often get confused. And particularly in this one, I think the premiums are conflated by the fact that we have information that the public doesn\u2019t have yet given the upcoming ESMO meeting that you\u2019ll see next week. And clearly, it\u2019s our assumption that the share price of the Immunomedics also would have appreciated as a result of the ESMO data as well. So why not take that into account when you look at the entirety of the premium.",
            "But all of that fundamentally, it\u2019s based on the clinical data, both in triple-negative breast cancer and the early clinical data and other indications we\u2019ve spoken about in this call as well as some of the data that you\u2019ll see at ESMO around the early combinability. So that\u2019s really where the intrinsic value comes from. And I\u2019d much rather look at it from that, then where the share price was trading 6 months, 9 months, 12 months ago. Merdad."

            "And I\u2019m happy -- yes. In terms of the Trop-2 expression, I\u2019d say it\u2019s really early days, Umer. I think we need to understand our relationship better, the Immunomedics team has done a great job of looking at that. And I would say the early data are really intriguing in terms of the relationship between Trop-2 expression and response. But it will take a lot more data for us to identify a cut point, what it looks like in different tumor types, what it looks like in various lines of therapy.",
            "So I\u2019d say it\u2019s really too early to draw too many conclusions there. We\u2019ll have to gather more data to look at that. But certainly, I feel that it looks as though the higher levels of Trop-2 expression certainly seem to have better responses in a general sense. But we\u2019ll have to see how that evolves over time.",
            "And then in terms of comparison to Daiichi Sankyo, again, as I said earlier, I think it\u2019s hard to compare because there are at different stages of development in different patient populations with different background therapies. Having said that, one of the things that we like about, obviously, the Immunomedics molecule is not only its efficacy, but also its safety profile. And as you\u2019ve seen with the Daiichi Sankyo molecule, they do see some interstitial lung disease that develops, and we haven\u2019t seen any evidence of that with the Immunomedics molecule. Lot of caveats around that, but we\u2019re heartened by the fact that the tolerability profile of the Immunomedics molecule seems to be really good and allows us to think about earlier lines of therapy in combinations in ways that I think other molecules, it would be harder to think about in that way. I hope that helps."
