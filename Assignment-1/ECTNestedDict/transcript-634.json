The decrease of approximately $99,000 or approximately 14% was mainly driven by a decline of roughly [404,000 and 72,000] in retail and office customers, as well as shifting to a royalty based model, which was offset by an increase of revenue of approximately $300,000, $57,000, and $41,000 in other medical and hospitality customers.",

Operating expenses in the second quarter of 2020 were approximately 1.21 million down modestly, compared to 1.24 million in the year a quarter ago.",
         "The three decrease was largely driven by a reduction in our operating expenses related to payroll and related expenses of approximately $253,000, and a decrease of approximately $53,000 in marketing and business development expenses in the second quarter of 2020, which was partially offset by an increase of approximately $260,000 in general, and administrative expenses, driven mostly higher by legal fees and some consulting expenses.

         "We believe we are sufficiently capitalized to support near-term working capital needs for our day-to-day operations, as we move towards being cash flow positive by year-end .We have worked feverishly during 2020 to successfully advance projects such as Monticello Mews, expand our product offerings in the medical and educational space, and build an ecosystem for the sales and service of COVID-19 diagnostic testing.",
