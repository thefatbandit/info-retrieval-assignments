         "Thank you, Andrea. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll begin with some recent developments for the company, Eva will review some financial details and then I\u2019ll wrap it up with some updates on regulatory activity, ASUS and dividends, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. We have had many positive recent developments including strong financial results, the filing of our water general rate case, the spin-off of our electric utility business to a separate subsidiary of American States Water, some term debt financing at Golden State Water, a nearly 10% dividend increase, new company leadership at American States Utility Services, or ASUS, for short, continued strong credit ratings and uninterrupted service to customers despite the ongoing pandemic.",
         "Our consolidated results for the second quarter of 2020 were $0.69 per share as compared to $0.72 per share for the second quarter of 2019. Included in the results for the second quarter of 2019 was the retroactive impact from a final decision on the water general rate case issued in May 2019, which totaled approximately $0.08 per share related to the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the retroactive impact related to the first quarter of 2019, consolidated diluted earnings during the second quarter of 2020 increased by $0.05 per share or 7.8% compared to the second quarter of 2019.",
         "We continue to invest in the reliability of our water and electric systems for the six months ended June 30, 2020, we spent $53.2 million in company funded capital expenditures. The Water Utility segment continues with its construction program. However, we have tried to avoid construction projects that would temporarily shut off water to customers. The construction programs for the Electric segment have largely not been negatively impacted. We estimate we\u2019ll spend $105 million to $120 million for the year at our regulated utilities, barring any further delays resulting from changes in Golden State Water\u2019s capital improvements schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This would be about 3.5 times our expected annual depreciation expense.",
         "On July 1, 2020 Golden State Water completed the transfer of the electric assets and liabilities of its electric division to Bear Valley Electric Service, Inc. or BVSI, for short, a wholly-owned subsidiary of American States Water. Last week, the Board of Directors announced a 9.8% increase in the quarterly cash dividend, which is the 66 consecutive calendar year with an increase in the dividend.",
         "Regarding any effects on our business, customers and employees related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to provide the same high-quality uninterrupted water, electric and wastewater services to our customers. We continue to make special accommodations for our customers in this uncertain time, including suspending service disconnections for nonpayment. Through our emergency response planning, we were well prepared to enable many of our employees to work remotely and have made other adjustments as needed until restrictions begin to ease. We don\u2019t expect a significant earnings impact on any of our subsidiaries.",
         "I\u2019m pleased to announce our new Senior Vice President of ASUS, Stuart Harrison, who joined our team on July 20. Stuart brings a wealth of experience. He has a strong leadership background and a proven business development track record working with the Department of Defense. He most recently served as Senior Vice President of Infrastructure and Engineering for Amentum, a leading contractor, which provides its federal government customers with essential services and mission support and equipment sustainment, information technology, nuclear and environmental remediation and threat mitigation along with other services.",
         "Amentum was formally a division of AECOM, but was sold to private equity in 2020. Stuart worked with Amentum and AECOM from 2011 through 2020. Prior to Amentum and AECOM Stuart worked for Parsons Corporation held various positions in the U.S. Army that spanned approximately 25 years, as a master of arts in national security and strategic studies from the U.S. Naval War College, a master of science in environmental engineering from Pennsylvania State University, and is a graduate of the U.S. military Academy at West Point. Stuart will build our successful contracted services business, as well as our strong reputation with the U.S. government. Our goal remains to continue providing best-in-class service to the 11 military bases we currently serve and use our strong positioning to compete for new base contracts. I continue to be optimistic about our prospects going forward, that has only strengthened with the addition of Stuart.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Eva to review the financial results for the quarter.",
         "Thank you, Eva. I\u2019d like to provide an update on our recent regulatory activity. In July, Golden State Water filed a general rate case application for all of its water regions and the general office. This general rate case will determine new water rates for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024. Among other things, Golden State Water requested capital budgets in this application of approximately $450.6 million for the three-year rate cycle and another $11.4 million of capital projects to be filed for revenue recovery through a letters when those projects are completed.",
         "A decision in the water general rate case is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2021, with new rates to become effective January 1, 2022. On July 3, the CPUC issued a proposed decision in the low-income affordability rulemaking, which is related to the low-income rate payer assistance and affordability objectives contained in the CPUC\u2019s 2010 Water Action Plan. The proposed decision also addressed other issues, including matters associated with the continued use of the water revenue adjustment mechanisms, also known as the WRAM. If approved, California water utilities that use full decoupling WRAM accounts, including Golden State Water, would be required to replace their WRAM accounts with a limited price adjustment mechanism known as the Monterey-Style WRAM in their next general rate case filing.",
         "This proposed decision was originally scheduled to be on the commission\u2019s consent agenda for a vote this Thursday. However, it is currently on the hold list, which means it will not be decided this Thursday. The next CPUC meeting after this week is Thursday, August 27. Management believes the proposed decision, if approved, should not have any impact on Golden State Water\u2019s WRAM balances during the current rate cycle, which includes years 2019 through 2021. Since its implementation in 2008, the WRAM has helped mitigate fluctuations in Golden State Water\u2019s revenues due to changes in water consumption by its customers.",
         "Replacing the WRAM with the mechanism recommended in the proposed decision would undo the current decoupling mechanism, which could result in more volatility in Golden State Water\u2019s future revenues and prevent full recovery of its authorized revenues. Golden State water filed comments to the proposed decision. At this time, management cannot predict the outcome of this matter, including its potential impact on the water general rate case application filed last month, which will set new rates for the years 2022 through 2024.",
         "Turning our attention to our electric utility business. On July 1, of this year, Golden State Water completed the transfer of the electric utility assets and liabilities from its electric division to Bear Valley Electric Service, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of American States Water. This reorganization is not expected to result in a substantive change to American States Water\u2019s operations or business segments. As you\u2019ll see from this slide, the weighted average water rate base, as adopted by the CPUC has grown from $717 million in 2017 to $916 million in 2020, a compound annual growth rate of 8.5%. The rate base amounts for 2020 do not include the $20.4 million of advice letter projects approved in Golden State Water\u2019s last general rate case.",
         "Let\u2019s move on to ASUS on Slide 19. ASUS\u2019s earnings contribution for the quarter was $0.12 per share, consistent with last year. As we look ahead to the full year, we reaffirm our previous guidance for ASUS\u2019 2020 earnings contribution of $0.46 to $0.50 per share. We are still involved in various stages of the proposal process at a number of military bases considering privatization of their water and wastewater systems. The U.S. government is expected to release additional bases for bidding over the next several years due to our strong relationship with the U.S. government as well as our expertise and experience in managing bases, we are well positioned to compete for these new contracts.",
         "I\u2019d like to turn our attention to dividends, outlined on Slide 20. Board of Directors last week approved a 9.8% dividend increase, increasing the annual dividend from $1.22 per share to $1.34 per share on American State\u2019s common shares. This is in addition to the 10.9% increase in 2019. This nearly 10% dividend increase reflects our Board\u2019s continued confidence in the growth and sustainability of the company\u2019s earnings.",
         "We believe achieving strong and consistent financial results, along with providing a growing dividend, allows the company to continue to attract capital to make necessary investments in the utility infrastructure for the communities and military bases that we serve and return value to our shareholders. American States Water Company has paid dividends to shareholders every year since 1931, increasing the dividends received by shareholders each calendar year for 66 consecutive years, which places it in an exclusive group of companies on the New York Stock Exchange that have achieved that result. The company\u2019s current dividend policy is to achieve a compound annual growth rate in the dividend of more than 7% over the long term.",
         "I\u2019d like to conclude our prepared remarks by thanking you for your interest in American States Water. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

      "Eva Tang": [
         "Thanks, Bob. Hello, everyone. Let me start with our second quarter financial results on Slide 9. Consolidated earnings for the quarter were $0.69 per share, compared to $0.72 per share as reported for same period in 2019. As Bob mentioned, last year\u2019s second quarter earnings at our Water segment were positively impacted by the CPUC final decision on the general rate case, with the new rates retroactive to January of 2019. The retroactive impact of the decision was reflected in the results for the second quarter. And of the consolidated company\u2019s $0.72 per share, $0.08 was related to the first quarter of 2018, which is shown on a separate line in the table on this slide.",
         "Further impacting the comparability of the water segment\u2019s earnings between the two quarters, was the recording of a $1.1 million reduction to administrative and general expense during last year\u2019s second quarter, positively impacting earnings by $0.02 per share to effect the CPUC\u2019s May 2019 approval for recovery of costs previously expensed as incurred. There was no similar reduction in 2020. The volatility in the financial markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant fluctuation in the investments held to fund one of Golden State Water\u2019s retirement plan. Gains on these investments contributed a $0.04 per share increase in the water segment\u2019s earnings for the quarter. Excluding the effect of these items, earnings for the second quarter of 2020 at the water segment increased by $0.01 per share as compared to the second quarter last year. The increase was due to a higher water gross margin from the new water rate and lower interest expense, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and effective income tax rate.",
         "Our electric segment\u2019s earnings for the second quarter of 2020 were $0.03 per share compared to $0.01 per share for the second quarter of 2019. Largely due to an increase in electric gross margin resulting from new rates authorized by the CPUC in its decision on the electric GRC issued in August of 2019, which were retroactive to January of 2018. Due to the delay in receiving the final decision, build electric revenue for the first six months of 2019 were based on 2017 adopted rates. Had the new rates being implemented timely on January 1, 2018, the earnings would have been $0.01 per share higher in the second quarter of 2019. Earnings from our contracted services segment were $0.12 per share for each of the second quarters of 2020 and 2019. The increase management fee revenues and overall decrease in operating expenses were mostly offset by a decrease in construction activity during the second quarter of 2020.",
         "Water revenues on this slide were $1 million lower during the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. Again, due to the delay in receiving a final decision on the water GRC, as mentioned, the retroactive impact of CPUC decision was recorded during the second quarter of 2019, which included approximately $3.4 million in revenue that related to the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the retroactive effect, while the revenue increased $2.4 million for the quarter due to full second year step increases for 2020 as a result of passing the earnings test.",
         "Electric revenues for the second quarter increased $300,000 to $7.7 million due to new rates approved by CPUC and effective January 1, 2020. In addition, billed revenue for the second quarter of 2019 were based on 2017 adopted electric rates, pending a CPUC final decision under electric GRC, which was not received until August of 2019 and was retroacted to January of 2018. Contracted services revenue for the quarter decreased $2.6 million to $26.5 million, due primarily to a decrease in construction activity partially offset by increases in management fees due to the successful resolution of various economic price adjustments.",
         "Looking at Slide 11. Our other electric supply costs were $26.3 million for the quarter, a decrease of $2.6 million from the same period last year. The decrease was partially due to a $1.7 million increase recorded in the second quarter of 2019, which related to the first quarter of 2019 to reflect the new adopted supply cost and corresponding while the revenue retroactive to January of 2019. The changes were part of the May 2019 CPUC\u2019s final decision on the water general rate case.",
         "Total operating expenses, excluding supply costs, increased $3 million versus Q2 of 2019, partially due to a $1.1 million reduction to reflect the CPUC\u2019s approval in May of 2019 for recovery of previously-incurred costs that were being tracked in CPUC authorized memorandum count, as well as a $1.7 million decrease in depreciation expense recorded in the second quarter of 2019, related to the first due to lower authorized composite rate authorizing the water general rate case. There were no similar reduction in 2020.",
         "There was also an increase in maintenance activity in all of our business segments. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in construction expense at ASUS due to an overall decrease in construction activity. Interest expense, net of interest income and other income, including investments held in a trust to fund a retirement benefit plan decreased $3 million for the quarter due to higher investment gains as a result of recent market conditions. There was also a decrease in interest expense due to a decrease in interest rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings.",
         "Slide 12 shows the EPS bridge for the quarter. Comparing the second quarter of 2020 with the same quarter of 2019. This slide reflects our year-to-date earnings per share by segment, fully diluted earnings for each of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were $1.07 per share. For more detail, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and Form 10-Q. In terms of the company\u2019s liquidity, net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2020 was $46.3 million as compared to $44.7 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in cash was due to deferrals of certain payroll income tax payments as a result of COVID-19 relief legislation. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in cash flow from accounts receivable by utility customers due to the economic impact of the pandemic and the suspension of service disconnection to customers for nonpayment.",
         "Our regulated utilities invested $33.2 million in the company-funded capital projects during the first six months of 2020. While COVID-19 has caused delays in certain projects, our regulated utility are still planning to spend $105 million to $120 million in company-funded capital expenditure for the year, barring further delays during the pandemic. On July 8, this year, Golden State Water completed the issuance of unsecured private placement notes totaling $160 million. Golden State Water used the proceeds to repay a large portion of its intercompany notes issued to the holding company, which allowed American States water to pay down short-term borrowings under its credit facility. As a result, American States Water took action to reverse its borrowing capacity back to $200 million, which was its original level when the facility was sized in 2018.",
         "We also established a separate three-year $35 million revolving credit facility for the Electric segment with the company option to increase it to $50 million. In June of 2020, Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Ratings affirmed an A+ credit rating with a stable outlook on both American States Water and Golden State Water Company. Also in June, Moody\u2019s Investors Service affirm its A2 rating with a stable outlook for Golden State Water. At this time, we do not expect American States Water to issue additional equity.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Bob."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thank you. Okay. So I wanted to ask a question, obviously, about this potential change to your decoupling mechanism. You mentioned that there wouldn\u2019t be any impact to your earnings through 2021, which is obvious given that that\u2019s the duration of the current rates set up. Now you have always managed to earn your allowed ROE on the water side. Now given those changes that could happen on the decoupling side, is there anything you can do in the way you manage your business that would allow you to still hit your allowed ROEs without that WRAM mechanism in place? And also, is there anything in that filing you made in July of the next years that will allow you to have those additional, basically, levers to manage your earnings? Thank you."

      "3": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Angie, and good to hear from you. So let me start with the proposed decision that\u2019s out there. We believe the language in the proposed decision is fairly clear, first of all, that it would apply to the first general rate case filed after the date of the final decision. So we\u2019ve filed our general rate case for 2022 through 2024. Right now, we don\u2019t believe the language in the proposed decision would apply, but would require us to use the Monterey-Style WRAM for 2022 through 2024. However, if the decision were to get changed, then we would need to basically refile our rate case. So sort of back to your original question about, is there anything we can do on that front?",
            "Well, introducing the Monterey-Style WRAM, I think, would cause us to change our rate design a bit. We would look to probably reduce the tier structure that\u2019s in our rates, therefore, make it a little easier for us to forecast our sales. It\u2019s really important when you have a Monterey-Style WRAM that you are able to achieve the sales forecast that you have included in your adoptive revenue requirement. So we sort of have to start, I believe, from Square 1 on \u2013 in terms of designing our rates and perhaps, flattening the tiers so that the company is able to do a better job of forecasting sales. With the tiered rates, the significant tiered rates that we have, which, as you know, encourage conservation. It does make sales forecasting more difficult because you\u2019re not sure how much usage is going to be used at the higher tiers. So again, perhaps flattening the tier structure. And then although we spend a great deal of time trying to get the sales forecast right, I think the tiered structure makes it more difficult."

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Okay. Because I understand that the \u2013 one of the consumer advocates has already suggested not to wait until the next rate case, but instead incorporate it in current or pending GRCs. I guess, in your case, it would be easier because you\u2019ve just made a filing, and you could actually probably make some corrections, but it\u2019s my understanding that there are two other large water utilities with the pending GRCs or pending decisions in their GRC. So I mean, I\u2019m assuming that at the very least, the commission would apply any rule change to all of the utilities at the same pace instead of just somewhat penalizing you but not applying the same role to say, CWT or American Water\u2019s New Jersey \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, California utility, would you agree?"

There\u2019s actually four of us that have full WRAM at this point, so they would need to move all four of us. How it affects their rent currently filed rates and their outstanding rate case, I\u2019m really not the right person to sort of comment on that. But I just want to let you know, though, that it\u2019s not easy to go back and do rate design on our \u2013 on a rate case, it\u2019s very, very complex. And so having to refile the GRC, if they require us to do that would be a difficult task, which we would be, of course, willing to do if we\u2019re expected to do that. Because the current filing we have with the commission and the current rate debt design we have filed with the commission for 2022 through 2024, does not anticipate moving to a Monterey-Style WRAM."

Do you actually think that, that\u2019s still possible this year, given COVID? And given the changes in leadership, are you becoming more bullish about longer-term growth expectations for that business? You never really gave us the long-term growth, you just gave us this year\u2019s guidance. But if you comment about ASUS at all?"

So the expectation is still that we may see some awards before year-end. With regard to the new hire at ASUS, we\u2019re expecting big things from him. He\u2019s a very talented person, and we would be looking to sort of step up our game on the business development front. We\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re very good in that area, we believe.

So I\u2019m assuming that most of the growth happens in the remainder of the year? And also, as you see it right now, let\u2019s say, $0.03 annual growth in that business, do you think is sustainable? Or is it very lumpy depending on the \u2013 on those contract awards?"

Also, as you know, Angie, we\u2019re always trying to get more work on the bases we currently serve. We\u2019re also looking to try to get additional assets transferred to us on the basis we currently serve. And so there\u2019s really sort of three different avenues in terms of trying to grow the revenue stream. But clearly, we had a step-up in our revenue projection through winning the Eglin Air Force Base and Fort Riley. When you get new privatizations, it does make the growth easier, I\u2019ll have to say that."

Yes, because, I mean, these are all projects that are approved, and it\u2019s just some of the struggles we\u2019re running into is just getting projects permitted and because of the pandemic. And then the other issue is we\u2019ve avoided taking customers out of water. And so it would be a little bit of a function of COVID-19 and where that has. But we\u2019re making really good progress, I would say, on our capital plan despite the pandemic. So again, we would look forward to try and make that up in 2021."

And therefore, the forecast is sort of more difficult to forecast. So I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s \u2013 it would be fair to even overlay on 2019 if the WRAM went away. I mean, we did have some under collections because sales were a bit lower than what was included in the rate case. But as long as we\u2019re able to \u2013 allowed to adjust our rate structure, I think we can control that."

It\u2019s a real head scratcher to me in terms of public policy. But if you start needing to flatten the pricing curves are the tiered rates. Then all of a sudden, perhaps you\u2019ll see increases in water use. But other companies that have the \u2013 there\u2019s a few companies that have the Monteray WRAM that like it. I personally prefer the full WRAM because we\u2019re just used to it. So \u2013 but it does come down to forecasting, and it does come down to tiered rates."

I know perhaps some of the environmentalists are not fans of getting rid of the full WRAM. But it\u2019s a bit of a head scratcher to some of the folks as to what\u2019s driving this? It really doesn\u2019t help low income customers because it basically reduces \u2013 if you reduce the trio rates, the folks with the biggest property end up paying less. And for the same revenue requirement, that means others pay more. So I just \u2013 I just don\u2019t understand it. But anyway, enough about that."

We had filed a solar facility where we were going to sell some of the power to the Big Bear area wastewater facility and the government entity that does wastewater up at Big Bear. And they do their own generation at this point, but they were going to come on as part of this. And they had a specified rate that they were willing to pay to become part of the project. Ultimately, public advocates did not like that rate. And therefore, the acronym is bar a lot, Big Bear area, regional wastewater authority. Yes, so they got taken out of the project because the price that was in the filing was sort of their price and public advocates wanted to increase the price to them. And so they backed out of the project, and then we were able to adjust the project and still get a settlement with the public advocates. Once borrower backed out of the project or because of that, we were able to get a settlement with public advocates. So it did incur a bit of a wrinkle along the way."
