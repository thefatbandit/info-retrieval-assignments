      "Mike Krimbill": [
         "Thanks, Trey. The past quarter presented us with many challenges and opportunities, which we have been managing, like all of our peers and most companies in general. We have seen unprecedented volatility in crude prices and other commodities, significant reductions in demand for crude, refined fuels and certain liquid products and an increase in upstream producers facing significant financial difficulties. We have taken numerous steps to reduce operating costs and capital expenditures while optimizing our assets. We have been working closely with our producer customers to make sure we are meeting their operational needs and helping them to manage through this environment as well. We took advantage of an extremely steep contango crude environment in April, May, only to see the forward curve flatten considerably in June and through July.",
         "As Trey said, a significant portion of our profits are embedded in our inventory at June 30, and we expect to recognize these margins when the product is sold in our second quarter. We held skim oil barrels in tank and expect to monetize those in the upcoming quarter as well at higher average prices than we saw throughout the first quarter. We have also taken this opportunity to add acreage dedications, expand our market share and further solidify our core operating areas in the Water Solutions business. In the Delaware Basin, we have all of our large diameter pipe online and flowing water. The 24-inch LEX Pipeline East to Andrews County, Texas is in service, the 24-inch WEX pipeline from Eddy County to Mentone, Texas is operational as is the 24-inch Orla Express from Lee County to Mentone.",
         "Our new 30-inch pipeline in Southern Eddy County, South of Texas is in service and flowing water as well. This is a major milestone for NGL as these capital expenditures are now behind us. Water volumes are currently increasing with additional substantial contracted volumes coming on the remainder of the year. As Trey mentioned, we have reduced operating expenses in our Water segment by approximately $2 million per month beginning in June, which we will continue to fully realize in our future quarters. In closing, we took this quarter to focus on items that we can control as we continue to position NGL for long-term success, focusing on the future while managing the short-term obstacles and opportunities. With that, shall we open it up for questions?"

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q1 Fiscal Year 2021 NGL Energy Partnership LP Earnings Conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded.",
         "[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Trey Karlovich, CFO. Please go ahead, sir."

      "Trey Karlovich": [
         "Great. Thank you, and welcome, everybody. First, I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. As a reminder, this conference call includes forward-looking statements and information. Words such as anticipate, project, expect, plan, goal, forecast, intend, could, believe, may, and similar expressions and statements are intended to identify forward-looking statements. While NGL Energy Partners believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.",
         "A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, anticipated results or other expectations included in the forward-looking statements. These factors include prices and market demand for natural gas and natural gas liquids, refined products and crude oil; level of production of crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas; the effect of weather conditions on demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; and the ability to successfully identify and consummate growth opportunities and strategic acquisitions at costs that are accretive to financial results; and to successfully integrate and operate assets and businesses that are built or acquired.",
         "Other factors that could impact these forward-looking statements are described in risk factors in the partnership\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other public filings and press releases. NGL Energy Partners undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. This conference call also includes certain non-GAAP measures, namely EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, which management believes are useful in evaluating our financial results.",
         "Please see the partnership\u2019s earnings releases, investor presentations, and annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q on our website at www.nglenergypartners.com, under the Investor Relations tab for more information on our use of non-GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of differences between any non-GAAP measures discussed on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.",
         "We believe it is important to cover our first quarter financial results before Mike gives his thoughts on the business and the rest of fiscal 2021. I will discuss our operating results for the quarter for each segment and then turn the call over to Mike before opening up the line for questions. We also have our EVPs, Doug White for Water; Don Robinson for Crude; and Jeff Pinter and Don Jensen for Liquids and Refined; along with other members of management on the call to assist with Q&A.",
         "Starting with Crude. The Crude segment reported approximately $31 million of adjusted EBITDA this quarter. There are several items impacting the Crude segment this quarter, including a benefit of contango with our storage assets, offset by costs related to the CMA plus roll component and the pricing of barrels purchased and shipped on Grand Mesa, the timing of recognition of hedge gains and losses as well as profit embedded in our inventory for July sales. We have estimated approximately $16 million of profit embedded in our inventory, which is valued at weighted average cost that we expect to recognize during our second quarter.",
         "We have already realized the majority of the hedge losses associated with these barrels when we rolled those hedges forward from June, so this is just a matter of timing. Grand Mesa volumes averaged 119,000 barrels per day this quarter. However, our profitability on a portion of those barrels was negatively impacted by the unprecedented calendar month average roll differentials during the quarter, which cost us an estimated $11 million compared to historical average differentials.",
         "Most of this cost was realized in May and June settlements, and the differential has come in significantly in July. This is a standard pricing mechanism for the industry. And while this loss is not expected to be made up this year, it is also not expected to continue. Finally for Crude, we benefited from contango storage for a portion of the quarter. However, the forward curve has flattened considerably, and we do not expect to see any significant contango for the remainder of this fiscal year. So from an earnings perspective, Crude generated $31 million of adjusted EBITDA. We have deferred earnings estimated at $16 million to be recognized later this year, most likely second quarter. And we lost approximately $11 million compared to historical results from the CMA rule.",
         "Moving to Water. Water adjusted EBITDA was $57 million for the quarter. Total disposal barrels average 1.4 million barrels per day during the quarter as volumes declined significantly in May. Delaware Basin volumes totaled 1.1 million barrels per day, approximately 80% of total volumes.",
         "Eagle Ford volumes averaged 95,000 barrels a day, down 64% compared to last year and have been the most impacted by the decline in prices, rigs and production shut-ins. We are expecting a slower recovery of volumes in this basin. DJ volumes were down as well to about 132,000 barrels per day compared to about 170,000 barrels per day in the comparable quarter last year.",
         "We received an average disposal fee of $0.63 per barrel for the quarter, very consistent with pricing in prior quarters. Of note, we did not sell all of our skim oil recovered during the quarter. Instead, we utilized our storage at each facility to hold barrels, and we have been selling those barrels at higher pricing during the current quarter. This should be a nice benefit to the second quarter when we are expecting about $4 million of incremental revenues. Our skim oil volumes remain hedged for calendar 2020 with approximately 3,000 barrels per day hedged at an average price just over $56 a barrel through December.",
         "Operating expenses came down significantly and averaged $0.32 per barrel for the quarter, a 25% reduction on a per barrel basis from last year. We completed a significant reduction in head count as well as reductions in chemicals and other supplies and utilities costs. We only benefited from these reductions in the last month or so of the quarter and expect our operating cost per barrel to continue to decrease in the second quarter and beyond as we target OpEx per barrel of less than $0.30.",
         "Moving to Liquids. Adjusted EBITDA for our Liquids and Refined Products segment totaled $12 million this quarter. Volumes of propane were strong through the quarter and compared to last year as we saw little to no impact in propane demand as a result of the pandemic at this time of the year. Butane, refined fuels and other liquids were down compared to last year, primarily as these products are utilized in transportation. We have seen a pickup in volumes heading into the second quarter. However, we continue to be cautious on our volume expectations for these products this year.",
         "Product margins were generally in line with our expectations during the quarter as this is the period that we are building inventory and preparing for the blending and heating seasons. Overall, our quarterly results were impacted by the pandemic, like many others. However, we took the opportunities to capitalize on our asset positions and maximize value, most of which will be recognized in future periods. Had those items been fully reflected in the first quarter, our financial results would have been more in line with market expectations. Based on these results and expectations for the rest of fiscal 2021, we are adding a range to our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $560 million to $600 million.",
         "Turning to capital expenditures and cash flows. Our growth CapEx totaled approximately $21 million for the quarter as we are completing the water infrastructure project we started last year including the Poker Lake tie in for Exxon, which we expect to bring online this fall. We have entered into incremental acreage dedications recently that will require minimal, if any, growth CapEx to meet the producers' disposal needs. We have made no changes to our target growth CapEx for fiscal 2021.",
         "Note, we did fund a significant amount of our growth capital expenditures that were incurred prior to and accrued on March 31, 2020, coming into this fiscal year as well as approximately $66 million of the $100 million remaining for the deferred purchase price of Mesquite. The remaining $34 million for Mesquite will be funded ratably through December 2020 and has been accrued on our balance sheet. We also focused on reducing our maintenance CapEx, which came down again in the first quarter to $9 million.",
         "Our combined capital expenditures forecast remains approximately $100 million for both growth and maintenance CapEx for the entire year. Our common unit distribution of $0.20 per unit for the quarter, $0.80 per unit on an annualized basis was declared a couple of weeks ago, along with our preferred unit distributions and will be paid on August 14. We continue to expect FY 2021 coverage to exceed 2.5 times based on our adjusted EBITDA guidance, and also continue to expect fiscal 2021 to be free cash flow positive with excess cash flow used to reduce indebtedness and improve leverage.",
         "Our leverage remains around 5.3 times at June 30, and we expect to stay at this level for the next couple of quarters under current operating conditions. We are also evaluating other opportunities to reduce leverage, including joint ventures and non-core assets.",
         "Finally, as a general matter, we do not generally comment on pending litigation. However, as many of you are aware, one of our customers is taking the steps within its Chapter three bankruptcy to attempt to reject our transportation contracts related to the Grand Mesa pipeline. Unfortunately, those contracts are currently subject to litigation. Last week, we filed an objection to their motions to reject the two contracts, and we separately filed a motion to lift the automatic stay so that we can seek the proper input from FERC, which we believe has jurisdiction over the contracts. The hearing related to these matters is set with the court for September 3.",
         "Obviously, our filings are public record, and you are welcome to review them. Basically, at this time, I cannot add anything additional here contained in those filings. As in any disputed matter, NGL is always amicable to resolving matters in a commercially reasonable way, but there are times where we owe it to our unitholders to seek validation of our contractual rights and use the course to do so, and we believe this circumstance is one of those matters. So we will be considering all legal possibilities with respect to defending the value in these contracts for our stakeholders. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn it over to Mike."

            "The range in Texas is anywhere from $0.45 to $0.55 generally. And in some areas, such as our Hillstone, Loving County assets, they\u2019re somewhere from that range, but maybe a little bit higher due to its unique area, lack of electricity, station power, such as that. So we do have higher rates in that area. New Mexico, with the Devonian wells, they are much more expensive to develop, lack of reliable offtake and takeaway. We see those prices range anywhere from the lows of $0.55 to $0.80. You would imagine prices may have decreased during this downturn, but we have not seen that. We\u2019ve seen some very temporary rate reductions to help the producers. But those rates, subsequent to the increase in commodity price, have gone back up to pre-COVID levels."

            "Yes. So thanks, Pearce. So as we\u2019ve done historically, we\u2019re always looking at opportunities. It is a more challenged market, however, we are seeing it improve. We\u2019ve got some significant opportunity ahead of us as well with \u2013 in particular, with our Water business, but really across all of our lines of business. So those are things that we continually evaluate and would expect to do so in these circumstances as well. Now generally speaking, the multiples that we would look at for those types of transactions, they have to be deleveraging in order to make an impact. So that\u2019s what we would be targeting. So I would say nothing is on sale. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add."

      "11": {
         "Remarks": [
            "So yes, it does include the onetime item in Crude. The other commentary I would add to that is that when we put the guidance up initially in April and then reiterated at the end of May, there was an extremely steep contango, which continued through May. That obviously disappeared in June. We do not expect contango to come back during the second half of this year and into next year. So we\u2019ve removed the expectations for any significant contango barrels being held, which will help from a working capital perspective to reduce working capital needs, but obviously has the impact of not generating that incremental EBITDA either. So we captured contango during the first quarter. When we gave our original guidance, we expected to capture some contango throughout the year. And at this point in time, we\u2019re not expecting that. Otherwise, no other real changes."

      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I would just add, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re really in this transition period. I mean if you\u2019re going to have significant contango, you\u2019re going to have low crude prices, which is certainly not good for future crude and water production. So we\u2019re in this period here of \u2013 I think some of our peers talked about \u2013 they \u2013 over $40 is a good thing. We\u2019re not going to have contango. I think fiscal 2020 or calendar 2021 is close to $45. And so this should lead to some rigs being put back into service we think no later than the first calendar quarter of 2021. I don\u2019t mean we get some DUCs completed in the last half of this year. So rather have a higher crude price than the contango."

Our expectation is to have that extended prior to it going current. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working on. We\u2019ve been in communications with our bank group. We expect the banker group to be constructive. There are a couple of ones that we\u2019ve been working through, including we did the refi of a term loan. We completed that with Apollo back in June, so that we needed to complete that. And then the recent bankruptcy filing, we\u2019ve been working through that as well. So this is something that is the number one priority of the finance team, expect it to be extended. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re working through."

We did that in 2016. So that\u2019s something that we continue to evaluate. A lot of factors go into that decision on what is the best use of capital? What do liquidity needs look like? How does it impact leverage? What are our maturities? So all of those things are weighed. I wouldn\u2019t take anything off the table, but I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s a core strategy either."

            "So when we provided our expectations for the year, we expected a 5% to 10% reduction in volumes on Grand Mesa from last year\u2019s results. So last year was about 130,000 barrels a day. So assuming about a 10% reduction, would be about 117,000 barrels a day. We\u2019re running just above that. So we attempted to factor that in. Most of the volumes on Grand Mesa are under MVCs. We attempted to factor this situation into our overall guidance as well. I think that\u2019s what I can say publicly and what\u2019s been stated previously as well."

            "Let me add to that. This is an area we\u2019ve seen some misconceptions, to be nice, in some of these people who volunteered their opinions on the Internet. It\u2019s not only an EBITDA issue. You\u2019re going to either have a contract or you\u2019re going to have a very large unsecured claim, which results in ownership or both. And if some of what you have is ownership, then that is positive, you might say, to your leverage because you\u2019re going to sell and pay down debt.",
            "So it\u2019s hard for us at this point to decide \u2013 to determine where this thing is going. Is there going to be \u2013 are they going to accept the contract? Are we going to own a bunch of the company? Are we going to reduce debt? Is EBITDA going to be the same or a little less? Just \u2013 we just can\u2019t say. I mean we have no idea. But you don\u2019t end up with nothing, which is what some of the folks on the Internet have set."
