         "Thanks, Rick. KLA\u2019s June quarter results highlight both the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We are demonstrating our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership all while growing operating profits generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our robust capital return strategies.",
         "Total revenue was $1.46 billion. non-GAAP gross margin was 60.3%, slightly above the midpoint of the guided range of the quarter of 59% to 61%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.73 towards the high end of the guiding range of $1.81 to $2.87. GAAP EPS was $2.63.",
         "Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment was modestly above expectations for the quarter. Foundry was once again strong at approximately 50% of semiconductor process control systems\u2019 revenue. logic was about 10% of semiconductor systems revenue and memory customers were roughly flat at 40% in the June quarter. Within memory, the business was evenly split about 50/50 between DRAM and NAND. revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment was a record $100 million, up 18% sequentially and 50% year-over-year is on track for double-digit growth in calendar 2020. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was also a record at $202 million, up 26% sequentially, and 10% year-over-year and above internal plans.",
         "In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash, total data, $3.5 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, free cash flow was $411 million in the June quarter. free cash flow conversion was 96.5% and free cash flow margin was 28.2%.",
         "for capital returns over the past 12 months, we have returned $1.35 billion to shareholders or 83% of free cash flow, including $522 million in dividends paid and $829 million in share repurchases. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis, and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. As Rick mentioned, a moment ago, our board approved our eleventh consecutive annual dividend increase, the results in an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share.",
         "as it relates to guidance for the September quarter, we\u2019d like to start out by saying that our operations teams have done a great job of mitigating the supply chain challenges and disruptions related to COVID-19 although we are carrying more inventory to mitigate unanticipated disruptions, should they occur.",
         "the extra measures we have taken to maintain flexibility and continuity of supply for critical components in our supply chain have definitely been effective as demonstrated by KLA\u2019s strong results for both our March and June quarters that either met or exceeded the midpoint of guidance ranges.",
         "with that said, we are narrowing our guidance range as we generally see consistency in the current operating environment. the demand profile today for the second half of the year is firming and we now anticipate that the second half will grow versus the first half of 2020. for the calendar year, we expect a faster than market growth year for semiconductor process control business and growth for the total company in line with or above our long-term revenue growth target range.",
         "With that, guidance for the September quarter is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $1.48 billion plus or minus $75 million. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as product makes this more favorable versus the June quarter. the market reception to new product offerings in our semiconductor process control business has been strong and as outlined at our Investor Day back in September, the company has made solid progress in our plans of driving costs and efficiencies on new product platforms and leveraging scale derived by our worldwide service infrastructure.",
         "Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.18 to $2.82 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $2.42 to $3.06.",
         "In closing, we have adapted to a challenging environment. We are executing well and have even more confidence that we\u2019re on track to meet our 2023 target model, both in terms of top-line growth and profitability. We are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model, which guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. We also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A."

         "Thank you, and welcome to KLA\u2019s fiscal Q4 2020 quarterly earnings call to discuss the results of our June quarter and the outlook for the September quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.",
         "During today\u2019s call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2020 that we released today after the market close in the form of a press release, Shareholder Letter and slide deck. All these documents can be found on the IR section of our website.",
         "Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today\u2019s earnings materials posted on the KLA IR website. Our IR website also contains a calendar of future virtual investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information, including our quiet period policy and links to KLA\u2019s SEC filings, including the most recent annual report and quarterly reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q.",
         "Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosed in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are also subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.",
         "As we mentioned last quarter, we are changing the format of these calls to provide deeper insights into KLA and our business performance and also a lot more time for Q&A. beginning of this quarter, we will provide some highlights from our full prepared remarks, which can be found in the shareholders\u2019 letter before beginning our Q&A session. I encourage you all to read the letter. It can be accessed on our KLA IR website.",
         "And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace.",
         "Charlie, please provide the instructions for the queuing and begin the Q&A."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the KLA Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]",
         "I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir."
      ],
      "Rick Wallace": [
         "Thanks, Kevin and thank you all for joining us today. On behalf of all of us at KLA, we hope you and your families are safe and in good health, and we thank you for your continued interest and support of our company. In many ways, our performance in the June quarter, once again, highlights how the KLA operating model and long-term strategic objectives provide a dependable framework to guide our execution and help us consistently deliver on our commitments. Thanks to the dedication, engagement and perseverance of our global workforce in the face of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
         "KLA delivered strong results in the June 2020 quarter. Revenue and non-GAAP EPS each finished above the midpoint of our guidance ranges, demonstrating strong consistent demand from our customers, exceptional execution by our teams and the enduring strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model under today\u2019s extraordinary circumstances.",
         "For my opening remarks today, I plan to touch on some of the key messages from our letter to shareholders. I\u2019ll start with an update on our priorities related to COVID-19, touch on the industry demand environment, and then cover five highlights from the quarter before passing it to Bren, who will review our financial highlights and our outlook.",
         "In terms of COVID-19, we continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees, their families, and our partners. Our action to date have been successful and effective as reflected in our strong financial results in the first half of calendar 2020, but more importantly, in our safety record to this point in this pandemic. It\u2019s also important is that our worldwide teams have never lost sight of what our customers need. Our teams have been exceptionally resourceful and committed to executing for our customers most pressing needs and challenges. Customer feedback has been outstanding. KLA is consistently delivering on our customer commitments. Investment in the long-term remains an important priority for us during this time. We\u2019re confident that our R&D investments will help ensure a bright future.",
         "Now, turning to the industry demand environment. Customer demand is strong. We ended the quarter with our second highest level of quarterly backlog ever. In the June quarter, we saw broad diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor process control was above plan, multiple EPC businesses set records and our services business achieved record installations.",
         "Today\u2019s environment continues to accelerate many of the secular industry growth drivers that we outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. Data center demand, 5G infrastructure, the revival of PC demand to support work from home, virtual collaboration, remote learning and entertainment and gaming are driving an acceleration of the data era that translates across end markets and industries.",
         "We\u2019re also seeing this acceleration in our own business, adopting new digital productivity tools to improve collaboration with teams and customers. We\u2019ve also increased investment to accelerate digitalization of our global enterprises. For example, in our services business, we\u2019re working closely with our customers to expand remote service technologies, to augment our in-country service and installations engineers.",
         "There are five highlights that stood out the most during the past quarter. First, we saw a continued strength in foundry and logic in the June quarter, and our revenue forecast for the remainder of 2020 shows relative balance between businesses from these customers. Business from memory customers is improving somewhat in the second half of 2020 versus the first half with higher business levels and more customer breadth expected in the December quarter with that momentum continuing into 2021.",
         "Second, KLA ended the June quarter with near record total company backlog demonstrating momentum in the marketplace across our portfolio. Newly launched products, such as the well-received eSL10, e-beam inspection platform helped drive our market leadership.",
         "Third, our services business continues to perform well and remains on track for growth and healthy free cash flow generation once again this calendar year. The services business set a record for system installations in the quarter. We see robust service contract penetration, which has risen steadily from the 70% plus contract penetration to 75% plus over the past several quarters and delivering a strong recurring revenue stream. We\u2019re forecasting service revenue growth in 2020 in line with our long-term annual 9% to 11% target.",
         "Fourth, the newly formed Electronics, Packaging and Components or EPC group delivered record results in the June quarter and finished above our internal forecast. within EPC, we achieved the key milestone with the SPTS delivering recordly quarterly revenue of $100 million in the June quarter. We expect 2020 to be a year of double-digit growth for SPTS. PCB also had a record quarter, driven by improved market positioning, supporting 5G infrastructure and handsets. The strong results for EPC are coming about 18 months post the acquisition of Orbotech. We\u2019re very pleased to see the successful demonstration of our strategic growth strategies bearing fruit. We\u2019re also on pace to achieve cost synergies from the Orbotech acquisition above the original targets.",
         "Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders; today, we announced our board of directors has approved the eleventh consecutive annual dividend increase. The increase raises our quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $0.90 per share for an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share. KLA\u2019s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15% since inception.",
         "Before I hand it over to Bren, let me summarize by saying KLA is focused on innovation and execution combined with market leadership and robust free cash flow have helped us successfully navigate through these challenging times. We believe the secular factors driving industry demand in our 2023 targets remain firmly intact and will drive diversified growth the strong long-term operating leverage that positions our business to be even stronger and more resilient in the future.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bren."

         "Remarks": [
            "good afternoon, solid job on the quarterly execution. Three months ago, the industry\u2019s supply chain, as well as demand trends looked pretty uncertain. You fast forward to today, supply chain has come back semiconductor fundamentals while we can, June or as fully showing signs of improvement entering the second half of the year. If I look at your results and guide and make some assumptions on December, it looks like you will be towards the upper end of your pre-COVID-19 revenue outlook or sort of in that low-double digits percentage revenue goal for this calendar year first. is that a fair assumption and maybe some commentary on your WFE spending outlook today versus pre-COVID-19 earlier this year?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Hey, Harlan, it\u2019s Bren and I\u2019ll go first here. So, I think your conclusions are generally correct. As we said in the prepared remarks, we see our view on the year to be generally at the \u2013 within our long-term target growth range of 7% to 9% or above. And so as we look at the year overall, I don\u2019t think things have changed all that much. I mean, you\u2019re right. There was a lot that had to be done back in March and June in terms of managing supply chain and supporting customers, but we\u2019ve worked through all that and we\u2019ve got some consistency now in our overall view. So in general, I would say that our views overall are virtually unchanged. on WFE, everybody counts it up a little bit differently, but I would \u2013 so I don\u2019t want to put a point number out there, but I would say that somewhere in the mid-to-high single-digit type growth, 55 to \u2013 or mid-50s to high-50s, probably the right way to think about it."

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Great. Thanks for that. And you entered the June quarter, I remember what the view of strong specialty semiconductor trends, but maybe, more meta trends within some of your other EPC segments like PCB and display as these are more consumer and sort of auto focused \u2013 automotive focus segments for you guys and probably, more impacted by COVID-19. but you\u2019ve got it delivered strong double-digit sequential and year-over-year growth in the PCB, display and component inspection business. So, what drove these solid trends and how are you thinking about this particular segment as you move through the second half of this year?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Harlan Sur"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. thanks, Harlan. We\u2019re really pleased with their performance in EPC and I think you have to \u2013 when you think about the different divisions, we saw a strong continuing momentum in packaging, and that\u2019s really the ICOS business. We\u2019re also seeing SPTS, the specialty semi business had a very strong showing and we mentioned that set a record there for revenue. PCB was earlier in the year, looked like it was going to soften and it strengthened and driven a lot by 5g infrastructure build out and we feel really good about the execution in that team. display is still in a tough spot and that\u2019s not one that really, we saw a lot of strength and we\u2019re following through on the conversations we\u2019ve had on display, where we\u2019re working on the cost structure and being positioned for when the recovery happens there. But I think the other business is \u2013 the other thing that\u2019s really notable is SPTs had a very strong quarter in spite of no automotive business.",
            "So that\u2019s really upside as we go forward. I think it\u2019s pretty fair to say automotive semiconductors have bottomed. And so we feel pretty good about \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much all upside from here as the spending has probably been curtailed, but showed signs toward the end of next year \u2013 this year and then into 2021, we\u2019ll see some resumption of investment as the electrification projects continue. So yes, we feel good about where we are with that and we are definitely getting traction, having those under one organization and engaging with customers at a high level."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hey, Harlan, it\u2019s bren. The only other thing I\u2019ll add to that is we go back to April, when we were thinking about the quarter, it was unclear what the handset environment would look like in the second half of the year. And so I think one of the encouraging signs that we did see to Rick\u2019s point was the PCB business was really driven by 5G and the preparation for the handset introductions that are to come. So, that was a bit of a surprise for us or perhaps had someone known built into it just related to overall COVID. So, I drove the SPTS business as Rick said, but also drove incremental upside in PCB."

            "Yes. good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bren, just on the gross margin guide into September, pretty good sequential growth. I\u2019m wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit. Is this a larger percent coming from the semi process control or is it mixed within SPC? And I guess importantly, do you think that the June quarter and now growth into September is a trend that you can sustain going forward? Or is this kind of an anomaly quarter relative to mix?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "John Pitzer"
      },
      "9": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Hey, John. So, I would say that, yes, I mean, quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019re seeing sequential growth in semi PC. and so that\u2019s having a positive effect on gross margins. And so I think that what we\u2019re seeing there, I\u2019m encouraged as I said in the shareholder letter, we talked a lot about driving cost and efficiency improvements in new platforms and customer section has been strong. So, we feel pretty good about the product portfolio we have and the margin position.",
            "So, let me just say that I have more confidence around our margin trajectory moving forward, although quarter-to-quarter, the mixed dynamic tends to be the biggest factor that drives our margin around this range. But certainly, as we look forward, we feel pretty confident that we should be able to maintain this sort of 61% and above type trajectory that that we\u2019re experiencing right now."

         "Remarks": [
            "Helpful. And then as my follow-up, Rick, you talked about second half of the calendar year growing over the first half, I\u2019m kind of curious if you could break that down between sort of memory and logic/foundry, and how might that have changed over the last 90 days? I don\u2019t want to words in your mouth, but it sounds like maybe, you\u2019re less optimistic about a memory uptick in the back half of the year and perhaps more optimistic about logic/foundry sustaining, and if that\u2019s the case in any read as we go into calendar year 2021."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. We do see we see \u2013 we think there\u2019s a lot of evidence that the foundry-logic is going to hold through the second half. And I think that also now, we\u2019re getting indications of strength going into 2021. Part of the uncertainty, I think around the year that everybody has is the memory recovery probably towards the end of the calendar year. And that\u2019s really where we would expect it to Q4 to strengthen there. So that\u2019s I think maybe the less certain part of that, but the setup for logic looks really good. I think the progress that customers and designs, and the ongoing investment by our customers and in multiple design wins and multiple proliferation of devices and multiple players. So, we\u2019re also getting breadth and our products are doing really well. So, we feel pretty strong about how the logic/foundry is going to hold up."

            "Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one either Rick or Bren, clearly, like two of your largest logic and foundry customers have spoken about push out of either the 7-nanometer or potentially even the 3-nanometer on the foundry side. with the backdrop, how do you think of KLA\u2019s process control revenue opportunity over the next year or two, given that some of the leading-edge nodes are getting pushed out and then I have a follow-up?"

            "Yes. There\u2019s really nothing that\u2019s been discussed publicly that hadn\u2019t been the way we\u2019d been factoring and forecasting our business. So, it\u2019s pretty much consistent with what we\u2019ve seen. I think some of the public announcements are catching up with some of what was going on. you have to look at why there are delays; when there are delays and the delays tend to come from it\u2019s much more an inability to execute than it is a demand. There\u2019s plenty of demand at the leading edge. It\u2019s the challenges associated with yield management with process control with the overall process integration and those are factors that we\u2019re heavily involved in.",
            "So, we think that there\u2019s a lot of continued momentum for us and process control both metrology and inspection on the leading nodes. And so that\u2019s part of why our earlier comments in the last Q&A question, where about the strength that we see through the calendar year and then into 2021. So, we feel pretty good about how that\u2019s going. And I think our in partnership with our customers; we\u2019re helping them work through some of the most challenging metrology and effectivity issues. Some of which frankly, they did not anticipate, but we did and we\u2019ve been showing some value and getting adoption as a result. Does that make sense?"

            "Yes, yes. that does. thanks a lot, Rick. And then just to follow-up on the product side, you guys introduced pattern wafer e-beam inspection to look semicon. I\u2019m just trying to figure it out, is your e-beam tool still focused on defect detection, or you feel looking at pattern facility of voltage contract, and your competent isn\u2019t going to like multi-beam tools. You guys are still at single beam. So, you just want to figure out the e-beam roadmap. Thank you."

            "Yes. So, what we wanted to make sure is that we could provide differentiated performance for \u2013 to address the market gaps that existed and that we could provide customers a complimentary solution along with our optical tools, because what they\u2019re really trying to balance is how do they get all the characterization understanding and product development that they\u2019re looking for out of a portfolio? So, we have some unique capabilities in our e-beam inspection tool. We think that the coverage it provides and the uniqueness, in addition to the fact that it\u2019s closely coupled with our optical tools, it gives a very strong advantage to our customers by using them in parallel. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.",
            "We have mapped out and we have a lot of confidence that we understand what the roadmaps look like in terms of the different e-beam architectures and we feel very confident about our ability to be competitive in e-beam. We wouldn\u2019t have reentered the market if we didn\u2019t feel like we had a differentiated solution. And so that\u2019s the ability both to find the defects of interest and to find them as throughputs that are compelling for our customers and we \u2013 as we map out the future, we don\u2019t see any gap between us and competitors. In fact, we see that we have the ability to continue to differentiate our solution."

So, most of what we see in the second half, and this was one area, where it wasn\u2019t all that clear if you back up three months ago and say, okay, we thought we\u2019d see some memory recovery in the second half of the year wasn\u2019t exactly sure when we\u2019d see it. But as we\u2019ve \u2013 so it looks like it\u2019s more December focused. And it \u2013 I would say, it is probably heavier on the flash side, although there is fluidity in terms of how customers are thinking about investment plans, but I think you can look at all the players that are out there that we would expect to see business start to improve in that timeframe. And then I think there\u2019s solid momentum as we move into next year.",
            "I don\u2019t want to provide a color on 2021, but I think as we take a step back and look at where memory has been, I mean, starting in the middle of 2018, we\u2019ve seen a pullback and very disciplined management of memory capacity and most of the investment focused on technology transition. So, as that market continues to recover, I think that the market\u2019s in a pretty healthy place overall as we move into 2021."

It is a 100% consumer focus. There\u2019s virtually no LCD investment out there. And so there\u2019s a fair amount of digestion of that capacity that\u2019s still being worked through.

Just maybe, following up CJ\u2019s question about the memory span and timing, typically memory is a little bit more metrology biased versus say logic and foundry being a little more inspection biased. Is there any difference on the timing of your tool deliveries, because what I\u2019m trying to get at is inspection tends to lead some of the process tools, but metrology may come in conjunction with process tools? So, am I looking at that correctly or are there still \u201clead time\u201d in terms of metrology shipments relative to process tools?"

So now, I think from a lead time point of view, I don\u2019t think the lead times on the products are all that much different a few months or so, but generally, that\u2019s how it plays out."

We certainly wish we could add people faster, both in terms of new heads, but also a replacement head count. And so this process \u2013 this situation has slowed us down from that perspective. So, I think if you just look at overall spending levels today, relative to revenue or size in the company in that $380 million to $385 million range. I mean, ultimately, the way we\u2019re going to run the company over the long-term is to drive a 1.5X drop through \u2013 1.5X the revenue growth rate drop through to earnings. And so that implies 40% to 50% incremental operating margins.",

So, it\u2019s a way to think about it. So, we\u2019re going to look at the opportunities to invest. We always invest in our portfolio, that\u2019s why our market share is almost 5X, our nearest competitors. Why we introduce products faster than our competitors is that we want to make sure we\u2019ve got the best products out there and we continue to innovate.

I would expect our process control business to outperform the market. So, as I said earlier around since it\u2019s such a big part of our business, that we would expect it to be within our target revenue range for the year is slightly above process control that statement\u2019s consistent for a process control segment as well."

            "Yes, it\u2019s really early for next year, but what we do see is, multiple customers making investments in foundry. And so far this year, it\u2019s been largely a smaller group, so one. and so the expansion of that is really in the conversations we\u2019ve been having and the commitment to that is what gives us the confidence for the second half of the year, and then the following projects that are coming after that, or why we think it\u2019s a good setup for 2021. But obviously, there\u2019s a long time between now and then. but I think the notion that there is success at these advanced nodes that you have the 5G infrastructure building out, you have a lot going on in the advanced computing and high performance computing along with the work toward AI is all very positive for what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the continued investment in foundry and logic. And a lot of that is driven by the additional capability people are getting from the advanced nodes.",
            "So, that\u2019s what gives us confidence that plus the conversations we\u2019re having and the \u2013 our challenge in meeting some of the slot demands through the rest of the year, just to keep up with what customers are talking about needing, and we have pretty good ways of judging their actual intent. There are also a number of projects in China that are IoT RF sensor focused. And so it\u2019s made foundry a higher percentage of the mix overall this year and we would expect some sustainability in that as we move into next year. So, to Rick\u2019s point, there\u2019s a fair amount of diversification, really across all end markets. we would expect automotive and industrial, and those areas that sort of fits back with the China statement or more trailing edge to be better next year and there\u2019s enough in-market demand at the leading edge that\u2019s driving incremental customer investment and mitigating reuse, and so on.",
            "So, I think the setup as we continue this year and the rest of the year, but also, has been moving to next year, it looks pretty good. Hey, there was a question earlier, Tim\u2019s question on share repurchase. I just want to spend a second on it. So, we \u2013 as we started the quarter, we focused on overall liquidity and wanted to see how the market shaked out, given all the unknowns on COVID. So, as we progressed through the quarter, we did pause our share repurchase plan. We did buy back a fair amount of shares in the March quarter and we\u2019d expect that we\u2019ll start our capital allocation program. We\u2019ll begin at this quarter again, at least around share repurchases and should finish the year in line with our objective of returning at least 70% of the cash flow we generate to shareholders. So, I would expect this year to be above that baseline."

And then there is also this trend of more sovereign manufacturing, but I understand it\u2019s probably same demand, but maybe, scattered across a more places that could cause some cyclicality and I don\u2019t know, how do you think KLA is positioned, when there are fewer leading edge foundry customers, and then if there is more sovereign manufacturing, does it shift more of the spending towards your competitors, who are exposed more to capacity rather than do technology ships or yield improvement? Just how do these two big trends play out for KLA over the next few years? Thank you."

So, we feel very good about the leading edge adoption that\u2019s out there. And I think that as you see the end markets adopt, I think that that deploys more capacity. And with foundries \u2013 if foundries are providing more of that capacity, then that tends to be a higher process control intensity and as those customers have to deliver a lot of yielded product to type market windows.",

I\u2019ll take the first part and then Bren can fill in the number, thinking that industry, Joe, I mean, what we\u2019ve seen in two things; one as the design rules have or the design complexity has pushed both in flash and of course, in DRAM, that does create more opportunity. In some cases, the opportunity was already there. What was missing from us was necessarily a solution. So, a part of it was having the capability and tools to support the advanced node and the needs, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re pretty happy with in terms of, as we laid out in the past, our ability to drive up process control, intensity, and memory, and we\u2019ve already seen the first part of that. So, we feel validated in that approach.",
            "The other thing that\u2019s interesting and we didn\u2019t necessarily know is going to happen, but on DRAM, the introduction of EUV for DRAM driving more defectivity needs and capability, and the usage of that. So, there are some really positive trends in terms of driving process control intensity well above what it was in the past for memory. We really went backwards when the first move to NAND was first introduced, because they went back a couple of design rules, and now they\u2019re back moving forward, we have some product capability. We\u2019ve learned how to solve some of these problems and we\u2019re engaged closely with customers.",
            "So, we feel good about the progression of process control intensity as the design rules continue to move forward with the technology nodes continue.

To Rick\u2019s point, we do have some new products in the pipeline that if these products are effective and can be deployed in multiple units across fabs, give us an opportunity to improve that intensity, even higher, both in terms of metrology with some x-ray capability that we\u2019re working on, but also if we can help solve the deep activity challenge, and defects within the stack and locating defects within the depth dimension of the stack. So, there is no shortage of opportunities, and I think we\u2019ve seen it improve so far and we look to see a little bit of improvement moving forward.",
            "On the DRAM side, with the introduction of EUV, there is infrastructure for UV, whether it\u2019s one layer or more, you still have to have a radical inspector to be able to qualify radicals, you have to qualify blanks. And then of course, you have to do print check to validate radical fidelity in the fab itself. So, there\u2019s also infrastructure investment that needs to happen to support EUV in the DRAM side."

I think in \u2013 as you know, in a foundry, especially, a multiproduct foundry, the other challenge they have is their multiple process flows. So, it also is a challenge for inspection and metrology to be able to support so many flows, because all the designs aren\u2019t all going through the same process flow. So, we generally feel really excited when we see the large number of increasing designs that advanced nodes that\u2019s what\u2019s really been encouraging. The other thing on the sustainability of it just \u2013 the one thing we would have wondered earlier this year was if we were to see utilization in the fabs of logic and foundry go down and we haven\u2019t. So, we feel pretty good about the sustainability of the investments across the board."

And of course, our guidance for the September quarter contemplates those plans. Overall, service has been \u2013 has done extremely well. And Rick talked about utilization rates at foundry and logic. We\u2019ve also seen very strong utilization rates and memory, which is another indicator of health of the market.",
            "So, we feel pretty good about all of that. We think we\u2019re going to grow our long-term growth rate expectation \u2013 annual growth rate expectation per service is 9% to 11% and we think we\u2019ll be in our target range and because of the scale that we\u2019re now able to drive and some of the investments we made over the years, in China, in particular, but also in Taiwan and Korea. and so on we\u2019re able to drive more economies of scale in our profit structure as well.",

When we look at all our customers, even back in Wuhan during the early stages of this crisis, the only people that we\u2019re going anywhere inside of fabs were our service guys, and they were there to support our customers. And so often with our customers, when they don\u2019t want to have visitors of any kind, that the exception is service, because they want to keep these fabs up and running. So really, it\u2019s been remarkable to see the resiliency of that. And as Bren said, the long-term trend looks good and this year, we feel really good about services ability to hit the targets we\u2019d set out pre-COVID for them.

So, there\u2019s never been a lack of interest and motivation that happened in Japan, of course, that happened in Korea, not quite as much in Taiwan, but definitely, happened in China. So for sure there is interest and desire to have their own capability. But, like as you know, this business, that\u2019s \u2013 the impetus on us is to keep driving performance capability and making sure we\u2019re competitive, so that we\u2019re more than competitive, we\u2019re compelling, so that we win that business. But yes, of course, there is interest in trying to have alternatives other than U.S. But I think the practical business of running semiconductors is you got to be competitive on a worldwide basis.",
            "And so you\u2019ve got to have the capabilities to compete worldwide. And that\u2019s always been, our belief is we have to win overall, because any opportunity, any region has to go with another solution they\u2019re going to do it. So, we don\u2019t see that as particularly different than it\u2019s been in the past."

So there is a bit of a headwind there about 40 basis points the last quarter. And so the revenue is up a little bit, so a similar impact. Well, this quarter artifacted in the margin guidance. So yes, I think as we start to normalize, whenever that might be, we\u2019ll start to \u2013 we\u2019ll get a tailwind from increasing competition in the freight market overall but yes, inbound freight is costs have gone up there."

But on the leading edge, sure, we\u2019ll see early and already in those conversations about that early capability. And that will be of course, our leading edge tools, not as many early on, but that\u2019s really in the debugging phase of that. And I would expect to follow on there. I would expect the broader levels of investment into the first half of next year. The breadth that we talked about this year, we would expect some continuation of that into next year. So, a lot of compelling opportunities for a number of players and in the foundry/logic space."

Historically, you see process control strength early in the process, and then at phase once the products are in volume production. Do you expect this pattern to continue or do you see more sustainable strength through tech transitions going forward, given what you talked about earlier about the dynamics happening in the memory market?"

I think the difference now on the leading edge is what EUV has done is brought back scaling. And so that was really more pronounced in a period, where we have that long gap where there was no EUV, there was not another lithography technology for several years. And so that really exacerbated that trend. So, the two other factors now you\u2019ve got additional designs, which is kind of a surprise from where maybe, the world was a while ago, and then you have multiple players trying to \u2013 so the phase of that is different, where you have different players trying to cut in, and since there\u2019s a leader and then the other folks are behind, that gives another way of at a different location.",
            "So, I think the net of all that is it tends to be more sustainable, plus we have more products that are more tied to production. An example would be overlay, which is much more correlated to production and the number of layers that get measured and overlay, doesn\u2019t really decrease that much now, given the challenges. So, you don\u2019t have that same reduced sampling and reduced the number of tools and in some of these product areas as we might have had in the past."

I just \u2013 there was something you said earlier that really resonated with me for KLA, which \u2013 it\u2019s a more [indiscernible], which intuitively makes sense for the foundry side. You see more chips, more AI, special there\u2019s 5G chips, chips going into different things that are all sort of custom. Can you help us think about how that provides uplift for clack overall over the next few years?"

            "Yes, sure. I mean, think about the worst-case scenario for us is there\u2019s one device made by one person, right? And they dial that process in and they lock it in for three years and they don\u2019t change anything, right? That would be the worst case, because as you know, what they really want to do is dial on the process, get everything under control and have it be just grump and then not pay any attention and let the thing run, have all the CPKs in line.",
            "So, the other end of that continuum is lots of process designs. What\u2019s interesting about foundry is they don\u2019t force one process. In fact, part of their selling proposition is you have multiple process flows through a foundry. So, if you look and you can publicly go do this and look at TSMC, you can pick tons of different process flows, which that means is the large number of change.",
            "The other thing that we\u2019ve seen in the reverse trend in the last few years, as you have hyperscalers, data center people designing their own chips, because they want to have an advantage in their own design. So, we have a lot of customers. We have our customers \u2013 customer traditionally is far greater than it used to be, which is why there\u2019s so many designs happening at advanced nodes. When the view was at some point that it was going to keep restricting the number of designs that\u2019s not what\u2019s happened. So that creates more and more flow of process and change, and the need to manage that is all upside. So, we\u2019re really excited when we started seeing the number of relevant designs become more and more successful, because that that\u2019s a factor that favor is process control in order for people to be so successful at producing those.
