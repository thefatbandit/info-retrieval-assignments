         "Thanks, Brian. And what a performance it was. Our results were remarkable this quarter in every aspect. Revenue in the second quarter was $743 million, an increase of $93 million or 14% compared to the same quarter last year. The increase is primarily due to the recent acquisition of TAS and Starr, both of which contribute to our expanding modular construction offerings. Same-store revenues were up 2% for the quarter and 4% for the first six months of 2020. The fact that we achieved an overall increase in same-store revenue is notable because our service revenue declined by $18 million year-over-year in the second quarter due to the effects of COVID-related closures especially in April and May.",
         "Gross profit was $146 million for the second quarter of 2020, an increase of $26 million or 21% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 19.6% in the second quarter of 2020, compared to 18.5% for the second quarter of 2019. The strong margins on our mechanical construction work this quarter more than offset the lower margins that we experienced in our electrical segment. Our electrical segment, in addition to their large project mix and lower service component, continues to experience more than their share of specific project challenges, including the impact of COVID-19 on productivity and certain purchase adjustments that impact our gross margins.",
         "With larger projects and less service, our electrical segment also lowers our SG&A percentage. SG&A expense was $85 million for the second quarter of 2020, which roughly matches the prior year, despite the fact that we\u2019ve added two new operations in the interim. On a same-store basis, SG&A declined by $4.7 million. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 11.4% in the current quarter compared to 13% in the second quarter of 2019. And we continue to benefit from SG&A leverage, largely due to the electrical segment, which requires lower levels of SG&A, as well as a reduction in certain expenses such as travel, resulting from actions we have taken in light of COVID-19. You may have also noted that we also experienced an $8 million sequential decline in SG&A, which is not a usual pattern for us from the first to the second quarter. This decline was caused by a combination of the cost control measures I just described and also resulted from the fact that the March quarter included $4.6 million of bad debt expense in SG&A of debt related to COVID. We did not take any additional accruals this quarter.",
         "Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 27.6%, which is right in the middle of our expected range and which compares to 23.9% in the year ago period, when our rate benefited from discrete items. Net income for the second quarter of 2020 was a record $39 million or $1.08 per share as compared to $24 million or $0.65 per share in 2019. This 66% increase in earnings per share is particularly impressive as it was achieved despite COVID-19-related challenges. Our trailing 12-month earnings per share is $3.46, a new record for a 12-month period.",
         "For our second quarter, EBITDA was $79 million, an increase of more than 50% as compared to the $50 million of EBITDA that we reported in the second quarter last year. Our trailing 12-month EBITDA is $241 million, a record for Comfort Systems USA by a substantial margin.",
         "Cash flow for the quarter was really extraordinary. Our free cash flow was $136 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter of 2019. Our cash flow includes $19 million of benefit that is a direct result of the federal stimulus bill, which allowed us to defer certain payroll and income tax payments in the second quarter. Approximately $8 million of this benefit has already been repaid in July. Our best estimate is that these discrete tax provisions will benefit our third quarter cash flow by a net $2 million to $3 million and will benefit fourth quarter cash flow by $10 million to $11 million. The $30 million to $35 million of cash flow benefit that we expect overall from these tax provisions will be repaid to the federal government in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2022.",
         "We also had some benefit this quarter from a temporary disinvestment in working capital as our workforce dipped in April and May. However, we believe that much of that benefit has been reabsorbed by the end of June. Even considering these two items, this was a fantastic level of free cash flow in a single quarter. In fact, the extraordinary cash flow this quarter resulted in two remarkable balance sheet accomplishments.",
         "First, we were able to reduce our leverage to less than one turn of trailing 12-month EBITDA much earlier than we had anticipated. Second, during the second quarter of 2020, we funded our second largest acquisition ever. However, we were able to fund that acquisition entirely from free cash flow during the quarter, and we still managed to reduce our debt level. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow is $251 million and that represents the highest 12-month free cash flow that we have ever achieved.",
         "During the first six months of 2020, we have purchased 290,000 of our shares at an average price of $37.91. And since we began our repurchase program, we have bought back nearly 9 million shares at an average price of $18.36. That\u2019s all I got, Brian."
      ],
      "Brian Lane": [
         "All right, thanks, Julie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. More than ever, I want to start this call by sincerely thanking all of our Comfort Systems USA employees for their work and commitment and especially their courage and resilience during this global pandemic. As all of you know, these are challenging times. But our employees are rising to the occasion. And I feel gratitude and admiration for them every day. We continue to focus on keeping our employees and our communities safe. We employ CDC and OSHA guidelines to ensure our workforce and our community is kept safe and healthy during COVID-19. And we are taking many other actions.",
         "In local markets, we have implemented the measures we feel are best suited to local circumstances, such as segmented work zones, staggered start time, temperature and symptom screening, disinfecting equipments and work areas, distancing and the wearing of protective face and nose personal protective equipment. We operate in numerous markets in dozens of states and our leadership in each location is conforming to the measures that are required locally and seeking the path that will work best to keep our people safe and well. That is a true strength of Comfort Systems.",
         "In the midst of these challenges, Comfort Systems USA achieved great earnings and extraordinary cash flow this quarter. We earned a $1.08 per share this quarter compared to $0.65 per share in the same quarter of last year. The $1.08 of earnings per share this quarter is the highest quarterly EPS in the history of our company.",
         "Revenues were $743 million compared to $650 million in the prior year. And despite revenue headwinds in service, we grew 2% on a same-store basis. Our cash flow was truly unprecedented as we had over $135 million of free cash flow this quarter. And through six months, we are more than $130 million ahead of the same period in 2019.",
         "COVID-19 began impacting our business in the second half of March. Our service business experienced the first and most pronounced negative impact, largely because of building closures and decisions by customers to limit building access.",
         "As of the end of the second quarter, the majority of our service operations have returned to normal activity and functioning. Meanwhile, our construction activities, overall, continued unabated, although individual jobs have experienced temporary closures and curtailments from time to time as a result of positive tests for COVID-19 of workers at various sites.",
         "Despite these productivity challenges, our local leadership, project management, and especially our field workers have extraordinarily \u2013 have been extraordinarily effective, exceeding our highest expectations. Our backlog as of June 30, 2020 was $1.53 billion. We maintained a very strong backlog despite a sequential same-store decrease of $133 million or 8% since March 31, 2020. This decrease is primarily composed of seasonal variation plus approximately $60 million of projects that we removed from backlog as a result of adverse effects relating to the pandemic. The majority of the projects we removed from backlog will likely be completed. However, we chose to remove any project that has been paused or is expected to be paused, if there is no specified resumption date.",
         "TAS Energy, which we acquired on April 1, is off to a great start. With TAS now a part of Comfort Systems USA and when considered in connection with our existing capabilities at EAS in North Carolina, we now have unmatched capabilities to complete complex modular and off-site construction of MEP assemblies in the growing modular construction industry. Our modular construction offering is particularly strong in the technology, medical and pharmaceutical industries. This combination allows us to cross-sell our capabilities to our existing customer base at all of our locations and augments our already strong industrial segment, which has increased to 40% of total revenues so far this year.",
         "I will discuss our business outlook in more detail in a few minutes, but first, let me turn this call over to Bill to review the details of our financial performance. Bill?",
         "All right, thanks, Bill. I\u2019m going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for full year 2020. Our backlog level is strong and at the end of the second quarter of 2020 was $1.53 billion. During the second quarter of 2020, we removed approximately $60 million of incomplete projects from backlog as a result of adverse effects relating to the pandemic. The majority of the projects we removed will likely be completed. However, we chose to remove any project that has been paused or is expected to be paused if there is no specified resumption date.",
         "Same-store backlog compared to one year ago has decreased by $56 million, but that is more than accounted for by the planned and expected decrease at Walker. Without Walker, our year-over-year backlog is actually up by approximately $15 million on a same-store basis. Sequentially, our same-store backlog decreased by $133 million. This decrease is primarily composed of seasonal variations, the removal of certain projects related to COVID, and the decline in our electrical segment.",
         "Most sectors have remained strong with particular strength in industrial. Our industrial revenue has grown to 40% of total revenue in the first half of 2020. Institutional markets, which include education, healthcare and government, were 36% of our revenue, which is consistent with what we saw in 2019. The commercial sector was 24% of our revenue. With the acquisition of TAS and Starr Electric, we expect to continue to grow our off-site construction business, particularly in the technology, medical and pharmaceutical industries. For 2020, construction is 80% of our total revenue with 50% from construction projects for new buildings and 30% from construction projects in existing buildings.",
         "Service is 20% of our revenue year-to-date with service projects providing 8% of revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 12% of revenue. Beginning in late March, our service business experienced the first and most pronounced negative impact associated with COVID-19, largely as a result of building closures or decisions by customers to limit building access. This led to a decline in service revenues of 12% in the second quarter of 2020, all related to service calls, maintenance and monitoring. Our project revenues in service this quarter were flat year-over-year. Overall service profit as measured in dollars was roughly the same because we had higher margins in the work that was performed.",
         "Although our construction activities have been classified as essential services in most markets, we have had certain jobs temporarily closed due to government actions, decision by owners, or upon positive tests for COVID-19 of workers at various sites. We have also had some delays in the award of new work and we have been informed of instances of delayed starts. These factors create more uncertainty than usual. And we believe that we could experience potential air pockets in future periods.",
         "In addition, we have implemented safety precautions and other COVID-19-related guidelines that have added costs or inefficiency as we work to create a safer environment for our team members and our communities. Even with those challenges, our mechanical construction projects performed incredibly well during the quarter.",
         "Finally, our outlook. It is not currently possible to quantify the potential impact to our second half of the year or in 2021 because we do not know how the pandemic and related government decisions will unfold, nor how the pandemic may impact the decisions of our customers. Assuming that the pandemic does not materially worsen the economic outlook of our markets, we currently believe that we can achieve full-year 2020 results that are at least comparable to our record results in 2019.",
         "We feel that we are well prepared to confront the challenges associated with this pandemic and we believe that our investments in service and our growth in the industrial segments of technology, medical and pharmaceutical give us a good opportunity to cope with these challenges successfully.",
         "We are pleased with our prospects. But given uncertainties related to the ongoing pandemic, we continue to prepare for a wide range of economic circumstances over the coming quarters. We have a great workforce and we feel confident that we will continue to make the most of the opportunities in our marketplaces. Thank you once again to our employees for your hard work and dedication.",

And in July, we continue to book a lot of medium-sized work. There is \u2013 the big work, we haven\u2019t had any big bookings, but we really wouldn\u2019t expect those until late this year, though."

On the construction front, right, we\u2019re pretty optimistic as I probably said four times in my script about pharmaceutical opportunity that we think is going to be coming. We\u2019ve already had a few that we\u2019re working on for a number of customers, and I think that will continue, hopefully, as they get closer to a vaccine and some other therapeutics. But let\u2019s hope and pray for that.",

So, we are seeing a lot of opportunities in a lot of buildings of all sorts about how to improve the air in the building from a whole host of options that are out there. So, we\u2019re working with our customers closely about what is the best solution for them. So, I think this is going to keep picking up pace, particularly on the construction front, if they get closer to some kind of medical solution to this pandemic."

We made good money on that, but not material to the results in the quarter. I am most excited about the secular sort of underlying aspects of this. I think that there will be a lot more investment in some of the sectors that we are best at. I think that this has to reinforce reassuring trends over the \u2013 in the coming years. And I also think that in the service side, we have had some sales of things people wanted to do quickly to address workplace safety. But when I talk to people in our controls and service companies, especially some of the more sophisticated offerings we have, they\u2019re most excited about the meetings they\u2019ve been able to get with people that they couldn\u2019t get to in the past, and with the idea that people are going to include these considerations as a much more prominent consideration at some levels in the coming years."

Is this sort of a more of an immediate thing? Schools are opening, hopefully going to try to open up in the fall. Is this an immediate opportunity or is this more of a maybe a 2021 kind of more of an opportunity?

You go sell and they will come back and do the type of analysis that measure the CO2 in the morning and then measure it in the evening and the CO2 change is a good predictor of how much air exchange there is and how much people are breathing each other\u2019s air. The control companies have a lot of really interesting products. But one of the things he said that was interesting was they put a slide and they realized they needed to put a slide at the front of their deck that said, things you can do today, because he said that they would meet with people and they\u2019d say, \"oh, that\u2019s great, sure, we\u2019ll hire you to do a study, but I would like to write to your PL for something today.\"",

But I think \u2013 I really do think the more important thing this does is that it puts these considerations front and center, I believe, really on a go-forward basis and that \u2013 and since we are the best, we believe we\u2019re the best there is in this stuff and really, only a few companies around can match us for what we can deploy.

We took \u2013 we had some people for a month or two take voluntary pay cuts. We had cuts that were made in the face of severe concern about just how complete the stoppages that the government was forcing would be. And so I think it\u2019s very hard to say, but I would say our SG&A in the next 18 months or 24 months will be lower than it would have been. But I don\u2019t \u2013 I couldn\u2019t throw out..."

As far as the rest of the year goes, they will not revenue nearly as heavily in the third or fourth quarter. They right now have really good prospects for a big revenue year next year.

            "It\u2019s not \u2013 so, it is somewhat electrical versus mechanical. On the service side, electrical is less urgent. So, it can get \u2013 for something like the pandemic, can slow service down for electrical more and so Walker\u2019s service division had a much greater proportionate hit than our mechanical service divisions overall. But the real difference with Walker is they do big complex gigantic work and we \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty comparable to our other companies that do that, right? It\u2019s not like \u2013 it is hard right now to have 200 people out building something with masks on and staggered work shifts and there\u2019s COVID\u2019s found and sections get cleaned out for eight days and guys have to go home for 14 days. And these guys are in a war. But it\u2019s not just \u2013 it\u2019s anybody, who is doing their kind of work is in that war and frankly, they\u2019re doing an amazing job, not just them, all of our companies that are doing that, it is unbelievable what they are accomplishing. It is really extraordinary. It just shows how \u2013 really, I think what you should take from this quarter is this is a really, really good company. We do things that people really, really need. Our collaboration is getting better and better all the time and the underlying secular trends really, favors the U.S. in reshoring and complex construction, we think."

But over time, we will cash flow our after-tax earnings we ever don\u2019t; actually, you should sell our stock and anybody else who doesn\u2019t. So when we have a quarter where we cash flow substantially more than our after-tax earnings that quarter, that means there will be other quarters, where we don\u2019t print money. So, there is \u2013 it will probably be a little bit of give back. We\u2019re also temporarily in a period where the federal government is giving us a little bit of a benefit. I went over that. But on the scale of Comfort Systems, it\u2019s a factor, it\u2019s not a driver. So, but I think we really \u2013 we still have good cash flow prospects for the rest of the year. But I don\u2019t think there is another blow-out quarter, because that\u2019s what \u2013 the quarter to end all quarters when it comes to cash flow."

I\u2019d like to see our headcount go up by hundreds each of the next two quarters. If that happens, that \u2013 there\u2019s a little investment in working capital. So ironically, a little good, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be rooting for a giant free cash flow for the rest of the year. I\u2019d rather prefer work to do and money \u2013 needing to spend a little money to get out and start doing it. But we\u2019re going to be fine. We are going to be fine.

Last couple of years \u2013 last year, this quarter, we were 23.9%. We picked up some benefit from some, what\u2019s called 179D. We did some energy retrofits, where we got credits transferred to us under federal laws and we just haven\u2019t had that so far this year. I don\u2019t expect much of that later this year. People are really not in the mindset to be \u2013 interestingly enough, energy efficiency and air quality are across purposes, right? Really, the way that you get energy efficiency is you use the same air over and over and the way that you get air quality is you go there outside, you bring in fresh air and improve it. So, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to see a lot of \u2013 I\u2019d say the 27.5%-ish, 28%, I think we\u2019re stuck at this rate for the rest of the year unless we achieve some other tax planning goal or something, but some of that\u2019s pretty \u2013 we have some of that going on, but it\u2019s pretty long-term."
