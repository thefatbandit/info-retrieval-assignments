      "Bradley Soultz": [
         "Thank you, Emily, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Brad Soultz, CEO of WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings, and I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our company\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call.",
         "Please turn to Slide 4 of our investor presentation. As a quick reminder, we completed the transformational merger between WillScot and Mobile Mini on July 1, establishing the North America market leader for both turnkey modular space and portable storage solutions, with pro forma LTM revenues and adjusted EBITDA of $1.65 billion and $619 million, respectively.",
         "As we work hand in hand with Kelly and the Mobile Mini team to prioritize our integration and execution efforts, both companies individually delivered Q2 operating and financial results that I can simply classify as broad outperformance. This execution, in light of the unexpected and unprecedented pandemic, confirms the resilience of these two great business, which will be even stronger together.",
         "I want to extend our sincerest thanks to all WillScot and Mobile Mini employees for their commitment to employee and customer safety and well-being, all while maintaining their focus on the execution.",
         "Moving to Slide 6. This merger was rooted in compelling strategic and financial rationale. Importantly, it\u2019s worth reiterating, WillScot and Mobile Mini are truly complementary businesses. These two companies\u2019 business models are both based on strong recurring revenues from long duration leases and similar asset characteristics, such as long lives, low maintenance, high margin, short payback periods, and strong cash flow generation.",
         "By combining our fleets totaling over 365,000 units, our offering becomes more strategic and valuable to customers. The diversity of our portfolio improves and we enhanced the scale and profitability of the business.",
         "We\u2019ve identified $50 million of clearly actionable annual cost synergies related to this merger, which is in addition to the $20 million of remaining cost synergies, which are associated with WillScot\u2019s prior acquisitions.",
         "We\u2019ll continue to increase penetration of turnkey solution or VAPS across the combined portfolio. And further, we estimate up to 80% of our combined end-markets use both modular office and storage, yet only 40% of our customers are currently renting from both WillScot and Mobile Mini, resulting in significant opportunities for cross-sell and customer pull-through for modular space to portable storage and vice versa.",
         "Putting it all together, we believe the combined company will produce approximately $0.5 billion in annual free cash flow once fully integrated, largely independent of market cycles.",
         "Now, please turn to Slide 8 for a snapshot of our Q2 results and our updated 2020 outlook, which reinforces the resilience of the business model. As previously noted, both standalone businesses broadly outperformed in an extremely challenging period.",
         "While Kelly and Tim will provide additional context later, I would like to highlight Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin expansion year-over-year of 480 basis points and 470 basis points for WillScot and Mobile Mini, respectively; and pro forma free cash flow generation of $70 million, driven by $39 million from WillScot and $31 million from Mobile Mini, both of which included some one-time merger and integration-related cash expenditures.",
         "Both companies remained extremely disciplined with respect to pricing, with WillScot delivering its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate growth across its US Modular division and Mobile Mini increasing North America Storage rates by over 3%.",
         "With our combined scale expansion of our price optimization tools and increasing value-added products and service penetration, we are confident in continuing to drive rate improvement as we look ahead. This broad outperformance, executed during the crisis, provides us with great confidence in updating our full-year 2020 guidance, which at the midpoint, would result in pro forma adjusted EBITDA growth of 5% on flat revenues and reduction in capital expenditures of 25% versus the prior year.",
         "Now turning to Slide 9, I\u2019d like to highlight our unique unit level economics. I remind, approximately 90% of the pro forma adjusted gross profits are derived from very predictable recurring leases of long-lived assets, with long average lease durations of greater than 30 months across our core asset classes.",
         "Steel storage containers, which represent just over half of our assets by account and 21% of our net book value, yield IRRs of 30% over a 30-year useful life. Modular office, which represents about a third of our assets by count and 62% of our net book value, yield IRRs of 25% over a 20-year useful life. We believe these already great returns across these assets can be even further improved as we integrate, leverage our combined scale, expand price optimization processes, continue to drive apps, and we relentlessly pursue operating efficiencies.",
         "Slide 10 provides a historical perspective as to the free cash flow resilience of the two standalone companies following the last global financial crisis. While we did not anticipate this pandemic, we expected to experience a cycle at some point and had our playbooks ready to execute. Both companies reacted immediately to the associated net decrease in demand for new lease activations by reducing capital and variable cost. Our respective Q2 2020 outperformance reaffirms the resilience of these two standalone platforms.",
         "Now please turn to Slide 11, where we\u2019ll provide a high-level update of our demand outlook across our diverse end markets. As a combined company, we have approximately 85,000 customers, with the top 50 customers accounting for only 15% of the total revenues, demonstrating how little customer concentration we have. We also estimate that 75% of our revenue are from recurring customers.",
         "Obviously, all end markets are still adjusting following the COVID shock, with some offsets from incremental social distancing needs and screening. While we\u2019ve seen stabilization and some sequential improvements headed into August, we remain extremely cautious on the volume outlook and our curtailing capital spending accordingly.",
         "Turning to Slide 12, while the one aspect of our multi-level \u2013 lever profitable growth equation that we do not control is demand for new activations, together, WillScot and Mobile Mini have a myriad of idiosyncratic top and bottom line levers and an extremely agile capital allocation process, all of which are fully in our control.",
         "Working down the page, I\u2019ll highlight several of these powerful growth levers. First, both WillScot and Mobile Mini have proven track records of price leadership, which is only further enhanced as we integrate the business and leverage our collective scale. This provides for multi-year revenue growth tailwinds, which we intend to further bolster.",
         "We have another multi-year organic revenue growth tailwind of $150 million across the combined business associated with simply maintaining the VAPS penetration on new activations that we\u2019ve already achieved over the last 12 months. As we continue to further increase VAPS penetration towards our long-term stated target of 80%, we\u2019d further increase and extend this growth.",
         "We have, as mentioned, over $70 million of identified and actionable cost synergies yet to be realized from this merger and prior acquisitions. And following the close of the transaction, Tim and Kelly and I have been able to spend sometime in the field. And we\u2019re now even more excited about the further upside associated with cross-selling opportunities across the combined customer base.",
         "We\u2019re also deploying technology for real-time operational decision-making, business optimization and enhanced customer service. But we\u2019re confident in our ability to execute this plan, all in the foundation of a robust balance sheet, over $950 million of liquidity and an immediate robust free cash flow generation, which we plan to deploy towards a long-term multifaceted capital allocation strategy.",
         "The strategy prioritizes rapid deleveraging into the 3 to 3.5 terms by the end of 2021, continued organic growth while achieving the cost and commercial synergies associated with the merger, as well as returning further value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.",
         "With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Kelly.",
         "Thanks, Tim and Kelly. Now as we step back and reflect upon where we are today, we remain convicted in our ability to deliver on our commitments, all while creating an exciting future for our customers, business partners and colleagues. The resilience of our business model built on recurring rental revenues, long-lived assets, increasing rates, and slow churn of the portfolio, in addition to the new idiosyncratic revenue and earnings growth levers associated with the merger, all together will continue to provide substantial shareholder value creation for years to come.",
         "Turning to Slide 29, I\u2019d like to outline our capital allocation priorities. Above all, we\u2019re committed to rapidly \u2013 rapid deleveraging to achieve a target leverage ratio range of 3.0 to 3.5x by the end of 2021, while funding all organic growth opportunities And while we\u2019re prioritizing the integration of WillScot and Mobile Mini in the next 12 months, we\u2019ll continue to opportunistically consider smart accretive acquisitions and further portfolio optimization.",
         "We\u2019re also introducing a 250 million share repurchase program as an initial step to further supplement shareholder returns using our robust free cash flow. This authorization program is multi-year with no expiration date and offers us flexibility in the amount and timing of repurchases. We are not paying the dividend at this time. Although the Board of Directors will continue to review capital allocation priorities on an ongoing basis.",
         "In closing, please turn to Slide 30. I\u2019d like to finish by extending a sincere thank you to the collective WillScot Mobile Mini team, who is going above and beyond to serve our company and our loyal customer base during both the merger and the ongoing pandemic. Importantly, the two teams have collaborated to establish a harmonized vision and values for the new combined company. And these principles will guide how we operate as both the team in the marketplace and in our communities.",
         "While we\u2019re proud of our respective WillScot and Mobile Mini cultures, we\u2019ve reaffirmed our belief that we\u2019re more alike than different and are extremely excited about our future. We will absolutely be stronger together. I wish all of you listening today, continued safety and good health. Thank you for taking the time to join us today.",
         "This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, would you please open the line?"
      ],
      "Emily Tadano": [
         "Thank you, and good morning.",
         "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that our press release, comments made on today\u2019s call and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. Our business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and consequently actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements.",
         "A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in our press release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to our 2019 Form 10-K and our other various SEC filings, including our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.",
         "Please note, WillScot Mobile Mini assumes no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, all of which speak only as of today.",
         "You should also note that our press releases in today\u2019s call include references to certain financial information expressed on a non-GAAP basis. We have included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information, please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release.",
         "The press release we issued this morning and the presentation for today\u2019s call are posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. A copy of the release will also be included in an 8-K submitted to the SEC. We will make a replay of this conference call available via webcast on the company website. A Mobile Mini, Inc. standalone earnings presentation for the second quarter of 2020 can be found on the WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp. Investor Relations website.",
         "Later today, we will also be filing our 10-Q with the SEC for the second quarter of 2020. Quarterly information and the related management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of Mobile Mini, Inc. for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2020 will also be filed by the company and an 8-K with the SEC. All documents that I just referenced will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. The documents filed with the SEC will also be available through the SEC as well.",
         "Today\u2019s discussion of results of operations in Q2 2020 is intended to cover historical results for WillScot Corporation and Mobile Mini individually for the three months ended June 30, 2020 or prior period. On July 1, 2020, WillScot through it\u2019s subsidiary, closed the merger with Mobile Mini, Inc. and changed its name to WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp. Unless the content, otherwise requires the terms company and WillScot Mobile Mini referred to the combined company.",
         "Now with me today, I have Brad Soultz, CEO of WillScot Mobile Mini; Kelly Williams, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tim Boswell, our CFO.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brad."
      ],
      "Kelly Williams": [
         "Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Kelly Williams, WillScot Mobile Mini\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer.",
         "To begin, like Brad, I want to thank all of our WillScot Mobile Mini employees for their commitment and dedication in these uncertain times. Their safety and health is most important to us.",
         "I\u2019m happy to report that our integration is progressing as planned. The WillScot Mobile Mini team is focused on integration and execution, in addition to driving the business forward. The strength of the team aligned around these priority \u2013 priorities positions the company to operate with better efficiency and achieve greater profitability than WillScot and Mobile Mini each did as standalone companies.",
         "Today, I will discuss the second quarter KPIs, as well as provide an update to our demand trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. The strong Q2 results of WillScot and Mobile Mini demonstrate the resilience of our business model. The installed base or units that were at customer sites pre-COVID-19 has behaved as expected as a result of project completions and unit returns slowing relative to last year. We continue to see this today.",
         "In the second quarter, WillScot\u2019s units on rent were only down 2% sequentially from the first quarter. Mobile Mini\u2019s North America Storage core units on rent were essentially flat sequentially from the first quarter.",
         "Slide 14 lays out the demand trends in Q2 and in July. The demand indicators for both businesses have been improving on a sequential monthly basis since April 2020, and you can see from the top charts on this page.",
         "Starting with the top left, the green bars represent monthly order rates for the US Modular business in 2020. Similarly, on the top right, the blue bars represent monthly net new orders, excluding seasonal units at North America Storage in 2020. The gray shadow bars behind both of them represent the order rates for the same period in 2019.",
         "While the leading indicators of demand across our diverse end markets has decelerated in April, we are steadily narrowing the gap from prior year in both core segments. US Modular\u2019s July order rates at WillScot were down 5% versus prior year, which compares to order rates being down approximately 20% year-over-year during the second quarter.",
         "North America Storage\u2019s net new orders, excluding seasonal units at Mobile Mini in July were down 4% versus prior year, which compares to order rates being down greater than 20% year-over-year during the second quarter. These two charts show that the new order trend is moving in the right direction with the new orders improving on a sequential monthly basis since the end of April 2020.",
         "The bottom chart show a snapshot of the pending deliveries. The green and blue portions of the bars respectively reflect the portion of orders at US Modular and North America Storage, which have delivery dates scheduled over the next four weeks, while the gray reflects those scheduled for delivery beyond the next four weeks.",
         "Pending orders with scheduled delivery dates in the next four weeks for both businesses are down compared to the same time last year. But compared to the pending orders in April 2020, both businesses have experienced a meaningful improvement in scheduling and customer certainty to project start dates over the past three months.",
         "US Modular\u2019s pending orders as of August 1, 2020 for modular units scheduled for delivery over the next four weeks are down approximately 8% to prior year versus having been down 25% year-over-year as of April 26, 2020.",
         "North America Storage solutions pending orders, excluding seasonal units as of August 1, 2020, scheduled to deliver over the next four weeks are down approximately 11% to prior year versus having been down greater than 25% year-over-year as of May 1, 2020.",
         "Mobile Mini\u2019s North America Storage business experiences a routine increase in seasonal demand every year in Q4 due to holiday-related demand for big box retailers. We refer to these as seasonal units, which are ordered nationwide and large volume for storage of additional holiday shopping inventory onsite.",
         "Heading into the pre-holiday season now, we are anticipating seasonal demand from big box retailers in Q4 to be similar to prior year. Q4 seasonal performance for 2018 and 2019 were record years for Mobile Mini. Mobile Mini\u2019s seasonal business is a nice complement to WillScot seasonal slowdown in Q4 and Q1.",
         "Now turning to Slide 15. The majority of the combined companies installed bases behaved as expected. They remain on rent today with no change to customer collections. WillScot US Modular had a total average units on rent of approximately 103,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of 1.3% sequentially from Q1.",
         "Mobile Mini\u2019s North America Storage Solutions had a total average units on rent for the same period of approximately 117,000, which was 3.1% decrease sequentially from Q1. However, Mobile Mini\u2019s core units on rent was essentially flat on a sequential quarterly basis. This low churn proves the resilience of our business model, which is based on recurring leasing of long-lived assets with an average lease duration of nearly three years.",
         "With regard to the installed base, we have not seen an acceleration of units returning to our branches in either of our two core segments, US Modular and North America Storage. In fact, the cadence of unit returns has actually slowed slightly during the COVID period. The charts on this slide further depict the complementary seasonality of the core segments\u2019 volume.",
         "Now on to Slide 16. Both business\u2019 strong rate performance during the past few months in the face of COVID-related headwinds demonstrates the beauty of the business model. WillScot achieved another great quarter, in which modular space average monthly rental rates also known as AMR, increased 9.5% year-over-year to $669. The US Modular segment\u2019s AMR increased 11.3% year-over-year to $681.",
         "Q2 marked the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate growth for this segment, and we expect the momentum to continue as we look ahead. US Modular\u2019s AMR increase of 11.3% year-over-year was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as continued growth in our Ready to Work solutions and deepen the value-added products and services, or VAPS, penetration across WillScot customer base.",
         "We also saw sequential increases in AMR from Q1 into Q2, so that pricing tailwinds in the modular portfolio continue to increase and drive sequential increases in modular leasing revenues.",
         "As of the end of the second quarter, the average monthly rate for our VAPS units increased 13.3% year-over-year. VAPS continues to represent both in organic revenue growth stream for existing WillScot fleet and also a great cross-selling opportunity to bundle with Mobile Mini\u2019s steel ground-level offices, or GLOs.",
         "Mobile Mini\u2019s North America Storage also achieved an increase in year-over-year rental rates of 3.2% for Q2 2020. The three months ended June 30, 2020 marked the 30th consecutive quarter of year-over-year rental rate increases for this segment. Our ability to increase rates annually is based on servicing our customers with high-quality products, high levels of customer service, a large sales force and the use of technology, including Mobile Mini Connect, our customer portal.",
         "Looking at Slide 17. Throughout the second quarter, our top priority was the health and safety of our employees, customers and vendors, while executing on our business model. All of our branches remained operational throughout the quarter with limited disruption. We continued and will continue for as long as the pandemic persists, our safety protocols at all locations.",
         "As a combined company, we are helping customers to fight the pandemic across our full platform of complementary products that include additional space on project sites, office sites, schools, hospitals, and more to facilitate the new social distancing norm, temporary testing facilities and screening sites, screening checkpoints at the front entrance of job sites, additional storage for supplies related to testing and screening and managed services hand washing stations bundled with our office and storage solutions.",
         "Finally, please turn to Slide 18. In Q2, both businesses closely managed costs in order to offset the impact of current revenue trends in the market conditions. We also proactively address semi variable expenses and overhead optimization. These actions drove adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 470 bps or more for each business, highlighting the potential flexibility at WillScot Mobile Mini to adjust both the cost structure and capital expenditures based on market conditions in order to preserve margins and free cash flow.",
         "To date, given the uncertainty around the duration of the downturn, we\u2019ve auctioned \u2013 actioned the variable components aggressively. As always, we\u2019ll let order delivery data that we see from the field on a real-time basis, drive our decision-making on any further necessary cost adjustments.",
         "Our demand-driven model allows us to proactively respond to this current economic situation. The majority of net CapEx spend is discretionary and we can flex capital expenditures fairly quickly, if necessary. Tim will touch on this later and provide updated CapEx guidance.",
         "While customers remain uncertain about project start dates, it\u2019s important to note we continue to experience increases in pricing and VAPS penetration and no material change in customer payment behavior. Return of units to our yards has not accelerated and we remain focused on continuing to service our customers as an essential service provider from our fully operational branch network.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tim"

         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at the time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.",
         "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, speaker, Emily Tadano, Director of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am."
      ],
      "Timothy Boswell": [
         "Thanks, Kelly. Let\u2019s jump into the financial review section for a bit more on the Q2 results, our improved post-merger capital structure and our updated 2020 guidance.",
         "Slide 21 captures the WillScot Q2 highlights and we\u2019re extremely proud of the results, given the unprecedented operating environment and the completion of another transformational merger with Mobile Mini.",
         "Our revenues proved to be extremely resilient, reflecting both the end market diversification, as well as the long lease durations that lend stability and predictability to our top line.",
         "While total revenue was down slightly versus prior year, our modular leasing revenue increased 2.3% from 2019. Modular leasing revenue also increased sequentially from Q1, demonstrating that our tailwinds in pricing and value-added products persisted through the worst months of the pandemic, and our lease revenue run rate continues to increase heading into Q3.",
         "Profitability and margins continued to improve both versus prior year and sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $10 million, despite the $7 million decline in revenue. The revenue decline was confined to our lower-margin in sales and delivery and installation revenues, partly offset by growth in our modular leasing revenues.",
         "So while revenue mix contributed to the margin expansion, modular leasing revenues themselves expanded by 430 basis points year-over-year due to variable cost reductions. We realized another approximately $5 million benefit from ModSpace acquisition synergies and executed targeted reductions in other areas due to lower demand. Together, these factors drove the 11.4% increase in adjusted EBITDA and 480 basis points of margin expansion versus prior year taking adjusted EBITDA margin to 38%.",
         "GAAP net income also increased by $24 million to $12.8 million in Q2, so we delivered strong and expanding profitability across all metrics, which is exactly what we expected in this environment. In the top right chart, free cash flow continues to inflect positively, totaling $39 million in Q2 and representing our fifth consecutive quarter of free cash generation.",
         "Slide 22 highlights these accelerating free cash flow trends. Cash provided by operating activities doubled sequentially from Q1 and was up 65% versus prior year. The formula is pretty simple. Adjusted EBITDA is up due to modular leasing revenue growth and cost reductions, interest expense is down 10% year-over-year, and working capital was a modest source of cash in the quarter with stabilized accounts receivable and increases in cash from customer deposits.",
         "At the bottom of the page, we\u2019re continuing to operate at reduced CapEx levels due to the demand environment. Net cash used in investing has been down year-over-year in each of the past three quarters and it was down 15% in Q2 versus prior year, which is roughly in line with the year-over-year delivery volume declines.",
         "Our cash used in investing over the last 12 months is approximately $135 million. And I expect, we\u2019ll stay at about this run rate on the Modular side of the business for the foreseeable future, unless the demand environment changes materially one way or the other.",
         "Overall, we expect operating free cash flows from the Modular business to remain on this trajectory in the second-half of the year. We will have approximately $51 million of remaining transaction costs, which will be expensed and paid in cash in Q3 and another $25 million of merger-related costs that had been accrued previously and were paid at closing. Again, most of these one-time costs were paid at closing in our July 1 debt balance, but I wanted to flag this since they will appear as a headwind in both our Q3 income statement and cash from operating activities.",
         "Turning to Slide 24, I have the privilege of sharing another quarter of solid financial results from Mobile Mini. In Mini\u2019s Q2 results, we see a similar story of portfolio resilience, supported by long lease durations and pricing power, extraordinary profitability driven by flexibility in both the cost structure and capital expenditures and consistent free cash generation, with this being Mobile Mini is 50th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. That\u2019s over 12-years.",
         "Remarkably, adjusted EBITDA of $56.3 million was essentially flat to prior year, despite an $18 million decline in revenue and margins expanded 470 basis points to 42.6%. Mobile Mini\u2019s team did an outstanding job rightsizing the cost structure to align with the Q2 demand environment, taking out approximately $6 million of cost in the quarter.",
         "Over half of the revenue decline was driven by Mobile Mini\u2019s Tank & Pump segment, with the remainder driven by trucking revenues due to lower delivery and return activity.",
         "Similar to rental revenue trends in the WillScot business, Mobile Mini\u2019s Storage Solutions business was remarkably resilient due to diversification and long lease duration in the portfolio and increases in pricing and managed services. Managed services generated $3.1 million of net revenue in the quarter and was up nearly 82% from Q2 of 2019.",
         "GAAP net income increased by 22% to $17.2 million and free cash flow increased 38% sequentially from Q1 to $31 million in Q2 and would have totaled $44 million if we exclude merger-related costs. Similar to the WillScot results, Mobile Mini delivered solid profitability and expanded margins at all levels.",
         "Page 25 breaks down Mobile Mini\u2019s cash flows further. In the top chart, operating free cash flows of $39 million increased sequentially by $6 million. The decline relative to prior year is a bit misleading. We incurred $13 million of cash costs in Q2 2020 related to the merger.",
         "And in 2019, Mobile Mini drove sharp improvement in accounts receivable with days sales outstanding dropping by approximately 10 days into the low-60s. Most of that improvement occurred in the first-half of 2019, representing a $21 million source of cash last year and Mobile Mini has done a great job maintaining those DSOs into low-60s.",
         "In the bottom chart, net CapEx dropped by 65% to $8 million in Q2, with most of that investment going towards ground level office conversions, which has continued to grow units on rents in the market and achieved a 7.2% rental rate increase year-over-year in Q2. This highlights the extreme flexibility we have to manage discretionary CapEx in these businesses and this flexibility is even greater across the storage asset class. Altogether, the Mobile Mini team delivered an outstanding second quarter.",
         "Shifting quickly to our debt structure on Page 26. Given the merger closed on July 1, the right-hand column showing the July 1 debt structure is more relevant than our June 30 balance sheet, because it shows the net result of the merger-related financing activity and represents our debt structure heading into the third quarter.",
         "As reported previously, we put in place a new $2.4 billion ABL credit facility, secured by the combined asset base of WillScot Mobile Mini. At merger close, we had over $915 million of availability. So combined with our accelerating free cash flows, we have significant excess liquidity available to support any potential operating requirements.",
         "The ABL credit facility has a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.875%, which is a lower spread than in WillScot\u2019s prior facility and there is no LIBOR floor, so we are benefiting fully from the exceptionally low interest rate environment.",
         "Concurrent with closing the merger, we refinanced our old 2022 notes by issuing the new 2025 notes. We issued the 2025 notes in June contingent on closing the merger, so they show up on the June balance sheet, along with $655 million of restricted cash. And you see the 2022 notes are gone as of early July.",
         "Overall, in the pro forma financial statements that we\u2019ll file today, you\u2019ll see that pro forma interest expense for the combined company is down approximately $32 million, or 20% on an annualized basis relative to the combined reported 2019 results.",
         "Our annual cash interest expense going forward is approximately $115 million, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs; and our weighted average cost of debt is approximately 4.4%, representing significant value accretion to shareholders, resulting from the recapitalization of the company.",
         "We subsequently announced the redemption of 10% of our 2023 notes, which will close tomorrow, and we will continue to optimize the debt structure opportunistically. Overall, we\u2019ve put in place a simple debt structure that gives us all of the liquidity and covenant flexibility necessary to operate this business over the long-term.",
         "Quickly shifting to our equity structure on Page 27. Similar to the debt discussion, the merger-related equity issuance took place on July 1. So you see the June 30 common share count increase by 106 million shares on July 1 to approximately $228 million \u2013 228 million shares outstanding currently.",
         "Importantly, on June 30, TDR Capital exchanged its minority interest in our subsidiary, WillScot Holdings Corp., for 10.6 million common shares, which allowed us to collect the prior Class A and Class B structure into a single common share class.",
         "You\u2019ll note, this also eliminates the minority interest on our June 30 balance sheet and will eliminate the minority interest in our income statement going forward. We remain committed to simplifying our equity structure over time, and moving to a single share class is an important milestone on that journey.",
         "Our revised 2020 guidance on Page 28 is the best way to wrap up the financial review and give you a sense for where we are headed. While this has already been an extraordinary year due to the pandemic in the merger, WillScot Mobile Mini expects to deliver solid 5% adjusted EBITDA growth and approximately $460 million of adjusted EBITDA less net CapEx at the midpoint of our updated guidance ranges on a pro forma basis as if we had been together since 2019.",
         "You can think of the midpoint of the guidance as approximately $390 million of EBITDA contribution from WillScot and approximately $240 million from Mobile Mini. There\u2019s a limited synergy realization until we consolidate ERPs in the first-half of 2021, so that\u2019s a clean kind of year-over-year comparison versus 2019.",
         "The top line will be flat on a pro forma basis, with growth in core modular and storage rental revenues being offset by lower sales and transportation revenues due to the lower demand environment, as well as declines in our Tank & Pump business. We expect adjusted EBITDA will be up 5% for the year at the midpoint of our guidance, with margins expanding 240 basis points to 38% on a combined pro forma basis.",
         "And under the hood, we think adjusted EBITDA will be up year-over-year in every operating segment with the exception of Tank & Pump. This is truly extraordinary performance in this market. And perhaps more importantly, sitting here in August, we can look confidently into 2021, given the visibility provided by lease duration, our superior competitive position and the powerful value drivers inherent in this merger that we are only beginning to execute.",

As mentioned, first and foremost, we\u2019re prioritizing deleveraging into that 3 to 3.5 ratio range by the end of 2021.",

            "So I think that aligns pretty well with the $390 million of EBITDA guide at the midpoint. And we\u2019ve done what we\u2019ve needed to do in terms of managing the cost structure in order to deliver that as evidenced by the margin expansion on the WillScot platform. So I view that as certainly a net positive to where we were sitting at the end of April in our last call. And I think we\u2019re confident in that outlook.",
            "On the Mobile Mini side of the business, they\u2019re positioned to deliver a basically a flat EBITDA year at about $240 million, which is the midpoint of the guidance. So I just think that\u2019s a tremendous outcome, given you\u2019ve got a pretty substantial year-over-year headwind in the Tank & Pump business, being offset by growth in the core Storage Solutions business.",

And I don\u2019t get too hung up in exact, these will fluctuate a bit, depending on the point in time you\u2019re looking at it.",
            "What\u2019s encouraging on the WillScot side, is you\u2019ve got a much stronger percentage of that order book scheduled.

And as of July, trending down mid single digits year-over-year.",

What we believe is 80% of our end markets, if you just look at the stack on Slide 11, use both office and storage. What we know factually is about 40% of our customers, combined customers are pulling from both WillScot and Mobile Mini.",

I mean, we really have taken \u2013 been very proactive in taking cost out of the business and managing it in line with revenue.",
            "I think there\u2019s a couple of things. First of all, I think, the industrial softening in the second-half of 2019 was exacerbated in the first-half of 2020 by an oversupply of oil, leading to lower oil prices, reduced refinery capacity utilization, those types of things that COVID-19 hasn\u2019t assisted with at all.",
            "So I think, this \u2013 we have stabilized at this new norm. And I think it\u2019s probably going to take something at \u2013 as it relates to the virus for \u2013 to change substantially. So that said, this kind of new model that we\u2019re running under, I think, we ran nearly 30% EBITDA margins in Q2.",

But I think in the meantime, we\u2019re managing that business very effectively.

And I mean, I \u2013 I\u2019ve made reference to this on the last call that we had, I think culture means a lot. It means a lot to both companies. Brad referenced the creation of the values between both organizations. I think that \u2013 I think both companies are certainly getting to know one another. But I think our \u2013 we\u2019re certainly very excited about what we\u2019ve seen.",

We use real-time data down to the branch level to make decisions on asset management. I think when you think about the two coming together, that\u2019s \u2013 the increasing footprint is going to allow us to increase utilization by sharing assets, being closer to the customer.",

And I think you can assume it\u2019ll be kind of more opportunistic at higher leverage levels and then perhaps more of a consistent deployment of free cash flow, as we get closer and closer to that target leverage range."

Are you seeing an improvement kind of in your core business sequentially? Or has most of the order improvement really come from those opportunities as a result of social distancing and COVID?",
            "And then can you also comment on whether we\u2019ve started to see that order rate improvement reflected in units on rent? Or if that\u2019s still going to come? I think you commented that units on rent had improved sequentially in Modular and other North America, but I don\u2019t think the comment was made on Modular US?"

As we look at order rates heading into August, there\u2019s also certainly some further mitigation, if you will, associated with social distancing probably across all end markets and certainly early screening for COVID side. So I think you\u2019ve got both playing out there.",
            "And your assumption is right, we did highlight kind of sequential unit on rent growth in other North America, but we haven\u2019t seen it yet in the US segment. Although, as Kelly mentioned, US segment was down about 1% sequentially, so certainly not catastrophic and obviously have improving order levels."

There was certainly an impact associated with the events in the second quarter \u2013 second quarter\u2019s kind of that high volume, if he will, a very short-term leases, which come with high rates, as well as high VAPS. So there was certainly a bit of a mix influence on that, but we\u2019re pleased with where we are and we\u2019re certainly pleased with where we\u2019re heading as we track into the latter part of the year."

So just as we see these order rates improve and theoretically deliveries improving, can just help us think through the impact that should have to margins? And then also, obviously, since Mini has some of their own delivery network. Any thoughts longer-term on how you\u2019re thinking about delivery for the combined business?"

But certainly, on the WillScot side, yes, all else equal, if you\u2019ve got more returns than deliveries, you tend to have a bit of a margin impact.",
            "That said, we\u2019re showing delivery and installation margins in the 15% range. And we\u2019ve got other kind of actions in place a little bit more in-sourcing across the WillScot legacy platform that we believe can support delivery installation margins in that kind of 13% to 15% range.",
            "So I don\u2019t see a significant contraction there, maybe 200 basis points over Q3 and Q4, if delivery volumes pick up in excess of returns. But just to understand, there are some other levers that we\u2019re trying to action internally to sustain those margins up in the mid-teens. So maybe, Kelly, can you talk about trucking on the platform?"

      "42": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure Yes. And I think, Courtney, very similar to what Tim is mentioning on the WillScot side. It\u2019s \u2013 the trucking margin is dilutive at Mini to the overall rental margin as well. However, trucking margins have steadily gotten better, certainly over the last three or four years and I believe trucking margins on the North America Storage side were close to 40% in Q2.",
            "So it\u2019s a real opportunity. I\u2019ll just give you a little bit of data behind Mini. Mini runs about 85% of its trucking in-house, really the \u2013 it\u2019s the peak seasonal volume in Q4, which needs to be outsourced there. So we certainly look to optimize our trucking through route management. About 40% of the units that we deliver actually get what we call flipped or moved from one location \u2013 the pickup location on to the next customer without actually coming back.",
            "So simple sweep out that needs to be done as long as the product quality goes out in Grade A condition. So I think the trucking piece is something we continue to utilize. And I think that to Tim\u2019s point, bigger picture here logistics is a huge opportunity for both companies to improve margins.",
            "And I think there\u2019s a big customer relationship piece here. It\u2019s \u2013 the driver is typically the first and last touch point with the customer. And it does something that I certainly have many we\u2019ve taken advantage of in terms of enhancing the customer experience. I think we\u2019re looking very deeply into the opportunity between both organizations to optimize logistics and it\u2019s certainly a big focal point."

But can you elaborate a little bit more on the roadmap to the $500 million in free cash flow that the timing for kind of getting to that debt pool run rate and just help us on the kind of the bridge between this year on a pro forma basis and future years and just address the transition and restructuring costs and whatnot, and how they impact the phasing that would be really helpful? Thanks."

            "Yes, Ross, this is Tim. I\u2019ll get it started. And so when we first kind of introduced the $500 million free cash expectation, it was a pretty simple formula to get there. So it was predicated upon executing the $50 million of cost synergies, and again, 80% of those will be in the run rate two years from now. So I kind of view this as a second-half of 2022 or 2023 aspiration.",
            "And so over that period, how do you get there, you deliver the cost synergies, the integration costs that we\u2019re incurring now and will incur through the end of next year, will subside naturally. And over that period, if we can generate kind of top line growth and kind of the mid single-digit range with the flow-through to EBITDA that both platforms historically have generated, those factors plus some debt and interest reduction over that time kind of gets you to the $500 million level.",
            "And I don\u2019t think you have to get to creative to get there, if you just look at kind of the combined Q2 free cash flow of $70 million, there\u2019s easily $15 million of merger costs in there. We\u2019ve highlighted pro forma interest savings of $30 million annually, so let\u2019s call it, $7.5 million per quarter, added another $12.5 million per quarter of cost synergies and you\u2019re already at $105 million just basing \u2013 based on Q2\u2019s results alone.",
            "So you need to generate another, call it, $20 million a quarter or $80 million a year in order to get there. And that\u2019s mid single-digit revenue CAGR between now and 2023 in order to get to that level."

But first of all, should we consider that 3 to 3.5 times to be your leverage target through the cycle or just next year? I\u2019m curious, your thoughts on that. And then do you get there mostly from higher EBITDA or lower debt. I\u2019m trying to just get a sense as to what you\u2019re baking in, assuming for free cash flow next year to get there?"

And I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it a long-term target. That\u2019s our 18-month target that we think is very achievable based on where we are right now, both in terms of the macroeconomic environment, as well as the operating levers that we have within our control to kind of deliver that number over the next 18 months.",
            "So as we complete the integration, we reassess the operating environment 18 months from now. You would appropriately reconsider leverage levels. But based on what we know, sitting here right now today, we believe that\u2019s achievable, again, with growth levers within our control, the ability to manage discretionary free cash flow. As you know, we can flex the CapEx, both up and down, which gives us some flexibility in terms of how we get to that 3 to 3.5 times range."

Are you really going after that right now? I mean, is that \u2013 I\u2019m sure understand how major of an opportunity or minor of an opportunity that really is and the resources that you\u2019re dedicating to kind of exploit that.

As we\u2019ve said before, there\u2019s just a fair degree of uncertainty as we look ahead. So whatever opportunity the markets present, there\u2019s no one better positioned to capture than us and we\u2019ll certainly do that. You can take a look at social media or web preference \u2013 web presence can speak there. But we\u2019re absolutely going after.",

So we\u2019re not trying to get ahead of our skis here. We\u2019re going to go after and get whatever we can. We\u2019ll keep our eye on the end markets. With our scale, frankly, we should be able to outpace anyone in the industry. So we\u2019re going to go get it.

But we do have software that is available for us, Mini is utilizing it today that really drives sales territory optimization to prioritize these leads. And I think right now, we do win on a fairly regular basis. And I think, Brad and I sit back and look at the non-resi construction and look at our delivery declines and feel like we\u2019re grabbing market share, and there\u2019s certainly a portion of that, that\u2019s more than likely related to the pandemic.",
