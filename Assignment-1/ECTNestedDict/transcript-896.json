      "Al Monaco": [
         "Okay, thanks Jonathan, and good morning everybody. ",
         "While it\u2019s not much of a secret that the energy space is going through a challenging time, we\u2019ve all seen that through the recent events, so I\u2019m going to start today with how we\u2019re thinking about that and our long term perspectives on energy infrastructure. We\u2019ll then review the usual business update, including perhaps a bit of a deeper dive on crude oil fundamentals that we started last quarter. Colin will take you through the results and full year outlook, and I\u2019ll come back with the midyear checkpoint on the priorities.",
         "We\u2019re all acutely aware of how the energy landscape is changing, the long term energy transition for one, opposition to what we do, and the challenging regulatory and permitting environment, to say the least. That\u2019s been compounded of course by a COVID-induced economic contraction that\u2019s severely disrupting energy markets, and that\u2019s going to take some time to work through.",
         "But the bigger picture backdrop we\u2019re not losing sight of is that the fundamentals are intact. The fact is that low cost, reliable energy underpins the global economic engine and it\u2019s going to be critical to the recovery. The factors leading to future energy demand increases haven\u2019t changed either - population growth, urbanization, and an expanding middle class. There\u2019s no serious disagreement from any credible forecast on that. North America\u2019s ability to provide low cost energy should drive an increased share of global energy markets, and that means more infrastructure and modernizing energy systems here. ",
         "When you look at the challenges we\u2019re living through today through the lens of the undeniable need for more energy, we believe that the value of infrastructure and pipe in the ground will increase. Of course, you\u2019re not seeing that reflected today yet, but that\u2019s what the fundamentals are telling us.",
         "So what does that mean for Enbridge? We believe we\u2019re well positioned to be a winner in this environment. We\u2019ve got a highly strategic and diversified asset base that moves energy to the best markets, and our scale provides a low cost advantage to those markets. Our assets are underpinned by strong commercial constructs and 95% of our customers are investment grade. ",
         "We\u2019ve got a world class project execution capability, completing $30 billion of projects since 2016. It hasn\u2019t been straightforward by any means but we are getting things done.",
         "On the balance sheet, we\u2019re strong, as are our credit ratings. We sold $8 billion in assets, reduced costs, and simplified the corporate structure. ",
         "As you can see by the chart, our resilient pipeline utility model has delivered predictable cash flows and strong dividend growth through all cycles, and that\u2019s showing up again today. We believe we\u2019ll not only survive these industry challenges but thrive and win.",
         "Just to put that assertion to the test, the next slide is going to illustrate the transparency of the near term growth. Through 2022, we expect average annual Dcf per share of 5% to 7% growth. About 1% to 2% comes from embedded revenue growth optimization and cost efficiencies. This part of the equation is zero or what we call minimal capital intensity at Enbridge, which is what we like to see.",
         "Another 4.5% to 5% is driven by the $11 billion of projects we have in execution, including completion of Line 3 and the others that you see here on the list. That program should gives us $2.5 billion or so in incremental EBITDA. The combination of these two gives us confidence through 2022, and remember, we don\u2019t need any external equity to achieve that. After 2022, the same two buckets will drive growth, but we\u2019ll push harder on the embedded growth part of the equation here, so the goal is to try to elevate the 1% to 2% on that part of the equation. ",
         "On the capital bucket, we have organic opportunities in the hopper, which we\u2019ve talked to you about before and the teams are working on. In sum here, we see long term growth continuing from these two sources. ",
         "That\u2019s how we think about the big picture today and where Enbridge is at. Now let me shift to the second quarter highlights.",
         "We responded to the COVID challenges earlier, adding health and safety measures to make sure our people were protected and continued to deliver energy without disruption; in fact, we didn\u2019t really miss a beat on that front. We weathered the storm well, but we\u2019re monitoring the signposts very carefully to make sure we keep it that way.",
         "Results-wise, as you saw, we had a strong quarter. Despite the unprecedented downturn mainline volumes, our businesses picked up the slack, and credit to our people on the job they did through this quarter. We had good utilization in gas transmission and distribution, and higher rates kicked in on the Texas Eastern system. The rest of the liquids business performed well, which offset some of the mainline volume decline that we\u2019re talking about.",
         "Good energy services performance this quarter, even though we\u2019re living with compressed differentials, our prime storage assets captured good contango gains in Q2. All of this translated to $1.21 in Dcf per share, which caps off a pretty strong first half.",
         "While there are headwinds in the second half, and Colin will take you through that, we expect to be within the guidance range, and the cost savings we talked about last quarter were enabled in late Q2, so that should help in the second half as well as through 2021. ",
         "Our balance sheet and liquidity are in good shape. The 2020 funding plan is done now and we\u2019ve got ample liquidity through 2021. Finally, good progress on priorities. We sanctioned another $1 billion of new projects - that was good to see. Good outcomes on our rates cases, and Line 3 is moving forward, as is mainline contracting review, and I\u2019ll come back to those specifically in a few minutes.",
         "The takeaway here is that although 2020 has been a tough year for our sector and the industry, we\u2019re managing it well here at Enbridge.",
         "The next couple of slides update you on the crude oil outlook. Starting with product demand, the big driver, of course, is gasoline consumption which has come back as economies opened up, but as you can see, we\u2019re still below normal. Diesel improved a bit and jet fuel is still way off as personal and business travel are low. Overall, the pace of recovery was a little bit better than we thought in Q2, but with the rise in infection rates that we\u2019re seeing today, we\u2019re cautious on the timing of a full return.",
         "Our refreshed crude outlook is on the right-hand side here. Since April, North American demand came back by almost 3 million a day, but we see a more gradual pace of recovery from here. ",
         "For us, what\u2019s most important is the regional picture, though, so here\u2019s what happened on that front. As product demand came back, overall refining utilization picked up significantly, and that\u2019s shown in the grey circles here throughout North America. But of course, these markets are not homogenous. The purple boxes here show the uptick in our mainline utilization into our core markets which is now approaching pre-COVID levels. This really shows well the resiliency of the refining centers we deliver into and therefore the mainline. The Midwest and Gulf Coast refineries, as everyone knows, are the most complex in terms of what they process, so as demand came back, they ramped up quicker. ",
         "As you can see, Pad 2 heavy margins doubled from about $6 to $12, so those refineries and our system are first to recover. We saw good pull as well on Canadian heavy barrels into the Gulf, which helps our Flanagan and Seaway pipes. Light crude demand in eastern Canada still lags a bit though, which is why we have some space left on our light lines, but we expect this to increase as Ontario and Quebec continue to reopen.",
         "The next part of the story shows the upstream effects of all of this into Western Canada and our outlook for second half.",
         "In Q2, Western Canadian supply was off about 1.1 million barrels per day. The mainline in Q2 actually averaged 2.44 million barrels per day, which was roughly 400,000 barrels per day lower than our pre-COVID forecast at the beginning of the year. That\u2019s the blue line that you see on the right there, showing the 2.85 original line. Obviously we came in at the favorable end of the 400 to 600 we talked about on the Q1 call for decline this year, so that was a good outcome. ",
         "With stabilized prices, we\u2019ve seen heavy volumes come back. Actually, if you look at July, heavy capacity is being fully utilized again. Barring another shutdown of the economy, we expect mainline throughput closer to where we were in Q1 by year end.",
         "The way we\u2019re looking at the remaining six months, we\u2019re estimating an average throughput of about 2.6 million barrels per day, or roughly 250,000 lower than that blue line that we forecast originally in 2020. We expect to exit this year with some excess light capacity, but that should fill up in the first part of 2021. ",
         "While all of this is going on, we continue to think about what\u2019s next and optimize capacity on the system for volumes coming back. We\u2019re currently focused on low capital intensity revenue enhancements, so in Q2 we added another 50,000 barrels per day on the mainline and the first phase of our express expansion at 25,000 barrels per day, so good job by Vern and the team on that. We\u2019ve added so far, then, 175,000 barrels of egress in the last year with minimal capital, and that brings us to about 400,000 barrels per day over our 10-year CTS agreement that we\u2019ve added. This is a very good outcome obviously for us, but particularly for our customers who needed that capacity during this phase.",
         "The full replacement of Line 3, of course, will restore more capacity, so let\u2019s get to the Line 3 update now on the next slide.",
         "This is our usual milestones chart with the PUCs written order that you would have seen about 10 days ago now. The regulatory track on this slide is done as the petitions for reconsideration on the EIS, the certificate of need and the road permit were rejected by the PUC. ",
         "On permitting then, the focus is on the 401 right now. The Pollution Control Agency, they run the permitting process here, issued their draft in February and it basically said that our construction plans met what they needed. However, after they reviewed it and received public comments, they decided to hold what they call a contested case to finalize the permit. As a reminder, the 401 covers construction methods and scope of work rather than whether the project is needed or the route, and the PUC of course, as I said, has approved those items.",
         "Importantly, the Pollution Control Agency has set November 14 to finalize the issuance of the permit, and they\u2019ve also, as you\u2019ll see on this slide, put in a couple of interim dates here around the hearing and the ALJ, so that\u2019s good in that those milestones are set. The DNR and the U.S. Army Corps are continuing to work their permit in parallel.",
         "Again, we\u2019ve said this before, I know, but when we do have clarity on the final timing of those permits, we\u2019ll provide our IESD estimate for the U.S. portion of Line 3, and again a reminder, it should take six to nine months after we get the permits in our hands.",
         "Finally, maybe just an overall comment on Line 3. Of course we\u2019re disappointed with the delay in the 401 that came about last quarter, but I think in this case we think it improves further the permit and certainly solidifies it even more than it already would have been.",
         "Onto Line 5 now and the Great Lakes Tunnel. There\u2019s a lot of information on this slide that we\u2019d like you to takeaway, but maybe I\u2019ll make just two broad points about the project. First of all, Line 5 is absolutely critical to the entire region. It provides over 500,000 barrels per day of feedstock that provides refined products to Michigan, Ohio, and part of central Canada. Without Line 5, Michigan would be short three-quarters of a million gallons a day of propane, and a lot of that is for winter heating in the Upper Peninsula. Michigan would also be at least 45% short of gasoline, diesel and jet, and that\u2019s about half the regional supply that it uses every day, and of course let\u2019s not forget Detroit\u2019s airport fuel supply would be at risk. All of this impacts people, thousands of refining and related skill trades, fuel shortages across the state, and of course higher consumer energy prices. ",
         "There\u2019s no viable alternative for Line 5 - that\u2019s already been determined by the state\u2019s own study, and every refiner will tell you the same thing. The bottom line is that Michigan and the region would be short the energy they need to keep this economy moving, especially bringing ourselves out of COVID. ",
         "A second point on this, even though the current crossing is entirely safe, and again that\u2019s been confirmed by third parties on more than one occasion, we\u2019re replacing it with a state-of-the-art tunnel 100 feet below the lake bed. We\u2019re doing that because we want to provide Michiganders an added measure of comfort. A couple of years ago now, we reached an agreement with the state to construct the tunnel. The courts have now twice confirmed the agreements and the state isn\u2019t appealing that decision further. We\u2019ve completed the geotech work and design as well and filed our application.",
         "Just one final comment on this. I think one thing that\u2019s important and is often missed in this equation is that people support the tunnel. Seventy-five percent of the legislature, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted for it last month. Twenty-three counties formally endorsed it, and a strong majority of Michiganders want it to get going. ",
         "Slide 14 is a brief update of the mainline contracting. Again, this offering is the culmination of a two-year effort to negotiate a deal that makes sense for our customers and as well the entire industry. In May, the CER landed on the process and timing to review our application. It\u2019s a good thing because it\u2019s a single step process, and we\u2019re now fully into that responding to information requests back and forth. The process runs through April of next year, followed by an oral hearing, and remember our shippers here support the offering rated at 70% of our throughput, and the point of that is that they\u2019ll be active in the regulatory process.",
         "Just to reiterate, the benefits of contracting the mainline really revolve around what\u2019s good for customers and the entire industry. First and foremost, priority access at predictable, stable and competitive tolls, that\u2019s what they told us they wanted to see. Contracting secures a very much needed source of long term demand pull for WCSB supply from a highly competitive refinery complex that we just talked about. That will be good for the basin, and it supports future upstream investment.",
         "Perhaps the most important element of this, and often forgotten, is that contracting is going to support higher net backs for producers and maximize provincial revenues. That\u2019s because WCSB crude prices offer marginal transportation to move for the last barrel in the basin, and contracting ensures that producers and the province benefit from the lowest marginal transportation costs in all scenarios.",
         "We\u2019re expecting an CER decision in 2021 but will likely need now to extend interim rates for a period of time, and the CTS prescribes the tolls during that period.",
         "Onto gas transmission now, it\u2019s been a very busy year on the regulatory front, and we\u2019re very pleased with the outcomes there, as are our customers. For us, what this does is assure we earn a reasonable return, particularly as we enhance and modernize the system. By getting three proceedings done this year, we\u2019ve covered off about $12 billion in rate base, we\u2019ve locked down Texas Eastern in Q1, and we\u2019re now done on both Algonquin and the B.C. system. The combined revenue impact of those three is an increase in the order of $150 million annually.",
         "We also filed on Alliance, East Tennessee and Maritimes, and settlement discussions with customers will follow later this year.",
         "Onto Slide 16, Bill and his team have done a good job of getting new projects in place and execution is ongoing here, and these projects are going to contribute to the $2.5 billion in EBITDA that I mentioned earlier. The $4 billion of system expansions and extensions is going to keep the team busy through 2023. These projects, by the way, have good returns and are underpinned by solid commercial models and high quality counterparties. ",
         "Sable Trail Phase 2 went into service in May, and on the $1 billion T-South project, construction is progressing well. By the way, as a side note on this, Indigenous affiliated companies have won $30 million in business so far on this project, and recall as well, going back to Line 3, there\u2019s a very big opportunity for tribes in Minnesota as well.",
         "Lastly, we got FERC approval for the Cameron extension supplying Venture Global\u2019s Calcasieu LNG facility, and construction will start on that later this year.",
         "As you know, we recently won projects to feed LNG facilities on the Gulf. These are progressing, but not surprisingly given COVID and the demand decline globally for gas and LNG in particular, those will likely move at a slower pace now. We\u2019re managing the near term spend on those, but we will be ready to go when those facilities are sanctioned coming up.",
         "Moving now to our gas utility, the utility, as you\u2019ve heard me say before, is a true gem in our portfolio. It fits so well with our low risk value proposition, but it\u2019s also one of the fastest growing in North America. Cynthia and the team are making great progress on synergy capture from the combination of the two Ontario utilities. This is helping drive a very good ROE from this business, especially when you think about the low interest rate environment we\u2019re in.",
         "This quarter, we sanctioned another $300 million in organic projects for \u201921 and \u201922 in service, that\u2019s on top of the community expansion and reinforcements we have in flight. Aside from that, we continue to add 40,000 to 50,000 a year in new customers and there\u2019s opportunity to bring gas to new communities and system modernization, so combined this translates into over a billion a year of rate-based growth, so this is a franchise that just keeps on giving on many fronts.",
         "On the next slide, we\u2019ll wrap up the business review with renewables. Of course, renewables is not as large as the other businesses within the Enbridge context, but it\u2019s progressing really well. We\u2019ve built it gradually with the same utility-like commercial structure as the rest of our businesses. We\u2019ve grown our development, operational and construction capability most recently in European offshore, where we\u2019ve been focused mostly in the last little while. We have a good growth hopper here supported by good fundamentals in Europe and well developed supply chains, and that\u2019s probably been the biggest factor in bringing down power costs in Europe.",
         "In the last three years, we\u2019ve put three large offshore wind farms into service, totaling about a gigawatt of capacity, and over the last year we\u2019ve SIB two new investments in France. The most recent fee comp is a 500 megawatt wind farm located about 13 miles off the northwest France shoreline, and we\u2019ll start seeing cash flow from these new projects between \u201922 and \u201923. The three French projects, by the way, come with long term PPAs and some added protections which are unique here in these types of projects for wind variability. Again, very solid project slate here, and we have a very good partner in EDF.",
         "Finally on this one, we\u2019ve been focused on further enhancing our returns and we have another partnership here with the Canadian Pension Plan which is helping us do that, and it gives us scope to grow this business with less capital intensity. ",
         "With that review, I\u2019ll pass it to Colin to go over the financial results.",
         "Okay, thanks Colin.",
         "If we rewind back to Enbridge Day, you\u2019ll recall we set some priorities for ourselves in 2020, so this is basically a wrap-up with a midyear checkpoint. It\u2019s turned obviously to be a more difficult year for industry than anybody imagined, but if there was ever a time to have a low risk business model, it\u2019s now. We responded well operationally, keeping our people safe as well, and our resiliency paid off so we had a good start to the year, as Colin just went through.",
         "To protect against a prolonged and deeper recession, we took some actions on liquidity and completed our funding early for the year, and at the same time capitalized on some good rates in those financings. The well diversified stream of cash flow is helping us mitigate the impact of lower mainline volumes, throughput is coming back, but we\u2019re watching the recovery carefully and we\u2019re certainly not going to get ahead of ourselves.",
         "We took action to cut costs and we reaffirmed the guidance, and assuming we can get there, that will be a very good outcome in this kind of year.",
         "On Line 3, while the Pollution Control Agency\u2019s contested case has delayed things a bit, I think we\u2019re coming to the end of this process now, so we\u2019re looking forward to that. Finally, we continued to secure new growth for the future.",
         "Lastly on the remarks today, and before we get to the Q&A, many of you know John Whelen, our Chief Development Officer and, previous to that, CFO. After 28 years with Enbridge, John has decided to retire. He has been a key leader at Enbridge over many years, bringing his financial expertise and judgment to our growth and our evolution, someone who has really exemplified our values and approach to the business as a company. ",
         "John has taken a lot of pride in developing people, and as you know, succession planning is a big focus at Enbridge. Matthew Akman, who looks after strategy and power, will report to me, as will Allen Capps leading corporate development and energy services. ",
         "John has been a friend over this period, and not having him around will be an adjustment for us, but on behalf of Enbridge and I know many of you on the phone as well, we wish John and his family the very best in the future.",
         "With that, we\u2019ll turn it over back to the Operator for the Q&A."
      ],
      "Colin Gruending": [
         "Thanks Al, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll take you through our financial results, financial position, and our outlook for the full year.",
         "Slide 19 summarizes our results. I want to start by saying that I\u2019m very proud of our performance, all things considered. We\u2019ve worked hard over the years at strengthening our business and in the past few months have taken further actions to bolster the business. It\u2019s consistently been a conservative approach. It\u2019s serving us well, and I think it\u2019s a point of differentiation. ",
         "As you can see on the slide, second quarter adjusted EBITDA and Dcf were both up year-over-year on strong underlying performance, adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 billion in the quarter and Dcf of 2.4 billion. That\u2019s $1.21 per share Dcf, $0.07 better than last year. ",
         "What stood out to me during the quarter were the following items. We had strong reliable performance from a number of our businesses - gas, transmission, our utility, and the power business all performed well, materially unaffected by the COVID disruption. I think this is the diversity point. We had growth from recently completed projects, the German offshore wind projects and Gray Oak, so we\u2019re still getting things done. We had a stronger U.S. dollar benefiting our significant U.S. dollar cash flows, and we had also some opportunistic storage profits in our energy services segment. ",
         "Finally, we also had a little help from delayed maintenance capital related to COVID spend, but I\u2019ll come back to that in a minute.",
         "If we drill down to the segment EBITDA performance on Slide 20, we can see that liquids pipelines was down only 1% or $22 million, which is a decent outcome in the conditions. On average, our mainline was approximately 85% utilized during the quarter, delivering 2.44 million barrels per day, and as mentioned, that\u2019s about 400,000 barrels per day under-utilized but 100,000 barrels per day favorable relative to the midpoint of our guidance range in May. However, more than offsetting this under-utilization was a higher mainline toll, including a $0.20 surcharge on Line 3 Canada and a stronger U.S. dollar, as mentioned. ",
         "Our Gulf Cost and midcon systems were down period-over-period due to lower light spot volumes on the Bakken pipeline and the Seaway legacy system, largely as a result of reduced demand for lighter crudes in the Gulf in the quarter. Recall, though, that we are mostly take-or-pay on these contracted systems but do have a little bit of spot capacity, too.",
         "On the other hand, heavy deliveries into the Gulf were very strong, offsetting some of that weakness. Flanagan South pipeline utilization is a good example of this.",
         "Gas transmission EBITDA was up $39 million, another good outcome despite the Canadian gathering and processing asset sale last year, which contributed about $40 million per quarter historically. Two main positive drivers here. The first is continuing strength from our U.S. gas systems, headlined by Texas Eastern and primarily ongoing contributions from its recent rate settlement. We expect Texas Eastern\u2019s new rates to contribute an incremental CAD $125 million of full year EBITDA on a run rate basis. The second driver is the contribution from assets placed into service last year, namely Stratton Ridge and Phase 2 of Atlantic Bridge. This business segment continues to drive stable and predictable results with virtually all of our cash flows coming from reservation-based revenue contracts. ",
         "Looking forward, I should mention another item. We\u2019re working through an integrity program in this business and will have some capacity restrictions in place while we do that. That\u2019s going to limit throughput a little during the summer shoulder months so we can focus to getting back to full capacity by the winter heating season. Financially, that\u2019s going to mean about $12 million per month of lost EBITDA. The second quarter reflects one month of this, i.e. June, but we will likely have a few more months of this, the third quarter really, until full capacity restoration.",
         "Turning to other business segments, gas distribution EBITDA was up $16 million compare to last year. This reflects higher indexed distribution rates, more synergies, as Al mentioned, and stronger utilization from colder spring weather. Similarly, the power business was up $50 million for the quarter. This was driven by stronger wind resources at our U.S. wind facilities and contributions from the German offshore wind farms put into service, as mentioned. ",
         "Energy services was relatively flat over last year, but both this year and last can be characterized as stronger than usual results for this segment. This year, well publicized contango spreads in the crude market allowed us to capture profitable storage margins on a small portion of the company\u2019s storage fleet, primarily in Cushing. Looking ahead, we\u2019ve seen differentials tightening and most of the contango opportunity is now behind us, so second half results are looking much less robust in the segment. ",
         "Finally, eliminations and other was $23 million favorable to the second quarter of last year. Most of this improvement is from lower cost as we began to realize enterprise-wide cost reductions. About $60 million of targeted cost reductions were realized in the quarter, and we\u2019re realize the balance of the $300 million cited program in the second half.",
         "Moving to Slide 21 for other components of cash flow performance, a significant portion of our Dcf growth came from the strong EBITDA performance I just mentioned. Financing costs, maintenance costs, and taxes collectively are trending as expected for the full year with some timing differences showing up in the quarter. As mentioned, maintenance capital was light in the quarter as we experienced a slowdown in discretionary field work due to COVID-19 restrictions. In fact, we spent about $100 million less than expected; however, we do expect these capital expenditures to ramp up in the second half of the year, in line with our full year guidance.",
         "Finally on this slide, our cash distributions from joint venture investments benefited from new projects coming into service in late 2019.",
         "In summary, we had another very good quarter despite the challenges, and next, a few words on our financial position on Slide 22.",
         "Overall, our financial position is relatively strong. We\u2019ve been conservatively reinforcing the balance sheet and our liquidity to help us weather this downturn. Our 2020 needs have now been fully funded and we\u2019ve even pre-funded some of our 2021 capital requirements. As shown here, in terms of 2020 sources, our net cash flows are tracking to plan. We also banked some proceeds in the quarter from our continuing asset sales program, where again the objective is to enhance returns by recycling capital. ",
         "$5.5 billion of term debt has been issued so far this year at attractive rates, both underlying rates and reasonable credit spreads. In addition, we issued a $1.4 billion hybrid security in early July. This is in keeping with our conservative approach and represents opportunistic pre-funding of 2021 in the context of our Line 3 U.S. construction timeline firming up and our forward-looking capital markets uncertainty. The hybrid market is seldom fully constructive, so we seized the opportunity at a good tax deductible coupon. The 50% equity credit from the hybrid bolsters our financial position, which we view as a non-regret action in this environment.",
         "In terms of capital uses, our capital program for the year remains in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion inclusive of maintenance capital, and of course that reflects some Line 3 spending shift into the first half of 2021 offset by a stronger U.S. dollar and some announced project wins. ",
         "On the liquidity front, we exited the quarter with over $14 billion of available liquidity, and it\u2019s a little higher in July after the hybrid issuance. It\u2019s sufficient by design to get us through all of 2021 absent further capital market access. ",
         "Our leverage remains firmly in triple-B plus territory and continues to trend in 2020 well within our 4.5 to 5 times target range, so the balance sheet is in great shape and that\u2019s contributed to several agencies reaffirming their ratings recently, which I think is noteworthy. ",
         "Let\u2019s move finally to Slide 23 and our financial outlook for the rest of the year. While uncertainties remain, our business is resilient and diverse. These points and our first half results provide confidence in our full year outlook. As always there are some tailwinds and headwinds to consider in the second half against our original guidance. I think in both buckets, we\u2019ve talked about all of them. Tailwinds include lower interest rates, a stronger U.S. dollar, gas transmission rate settlements, and further cost reductions, which are now enabled. Those should be likely more than offset by headwinds, namely mainline volume utilization, catch-up and maintenance capital in line with the full year guidance, fewer opportunities in energy services, Q3 capacity availability on Texas Eastern, as mentioned, and finally lower contributions from our small commodity sensitive businesses at DCP and Aux Sable. ",
         "Looking at all these puts and takes for the remainder of the year along with positive first half results, we remain confident that we\u2019ll be within original Dcf per share guidance range of $4.50 to $4.80 per share.",
         "In sum, two messages from me. Number one, we\u2019re managing the business conservatively from a financial perspective, and two, the diversity of the business is shining through.",

            "Obviously it\u2019s an increasingly difficult environment to get pipeline projects developed, so I\u2019m wondering how that\u2019s impacting your capital allocation strategy. Maybe in your answer, you can specifically address what influence it\u2019s having on hurdle rates and project selection, but also the relative attractiveness of other and perhaps even new parts of the value chain you might consider, or other jurisdictions outside of North America."

            "Okay, well I\u2019ll go first, Robert. Thanks for the question - it\u2019s a good one in this environment, and then Colin can fill in. ",
            "I think you know us well in terms of the amount of effort we put into the capital allocation process. We\u2019ve got a pretty in-depth framework here and we\u2019ve put a lot of work into it, and more so even these days. I think if you go to hurdle rates specifically, we\u2019ve always taken the approach of developing those from the bottom up, and they\u2019re very much project specific. I guess maybe if you look at the overall weighted average cost of capital, just intuitively you\u2019d say bond yields are lower, obviously betas have been higher that we\u2019ve seen, so those two factors are at play in either direction.",
            "But in terms of what we\u2019re seeing out there today and the risks that you\u2019re pointing to, what we try to do is reflect each one of the risks around project challenges in the hurdle rate, so the simply way to look at it from the way we approach it is we do the basic hurdle rate based on those things I mentioned, but we essentially take adders, if you want to call them that, based on how we see the variability depending on what risk you\u2019re talking about.",
            "For example, today if you\u2019re entering a new build, you have to say whether or not you think schedule and costs will come in as you predicted, so we do our best to come up with those estimates and then we run a bunch of scenarios around that to see what happens to the equity return if schedule, say, is delayed and that schedule increases your cost inevitably. ",
            "When we do that, we can kind of assess what adder we need to apply, depending on what the type of sensitivity is that you\u2019re looking at. We do that, Robert, for essentially every element of the risk profile of a project. It\u2019s a very in-depth and pedantic review of hurdle rate, but it really is to the essence, I think, of what we\u2019re all about, which is making sure that when we put capital to work, and we put a lot of it to work in this business, you\u2019ve got to have a pretty good feel for ensuring you generate value above that hurdle rate, otherwise you\u2019re not really doing much to add any value at all. That\u2019s how we look at the process that we go through here. That may be more than what you wanted, but that\u2019s what we do.",
            "As to the other part of your question around other parts of the value chain, I think our view is always extending the value chain whenever we can. It\u2019s something that we always strive to do. A good example of that would be the liquids business, where you\u2019ve seen us extend that value chain from pipes and then all the way down to the terminal side of it, and the realm of exports that you saw in the Gulf Coast, for example, I think as long as we can do that on the same type of commercial model that we have today, I think we\u2019re good on that front. Those are the kinds of things that we would look at as priorities.",
            "With respect to--I think you said something about--I guess you implied international. Certainly on the face of it, what we do and the capabilities we have could be exported, if you want to look at it that way, but again we go through a pretty distinctive process there where we look at what the hurdles rates would need to be for international investments. We don\u2019t have anything other than the European business right now for wind that\u2019s really imminent, but certainly I suppose it could be an opportunity in the future. But you\u2019d have to really make sure that the country risk and the other factors within the risk profile fit with the rest of the business model.",
            "Anyway, that\u2019s the broad answer to your question. I don\u2019t know, Colin, if you want to add anything to that? Okay, so let\u2019s move on, then."

We have a couple ways to get Bakken crude into our system, so we\u2019re doing a lot of work on contingency planning should the courts shut down the DAPL pipeline. ",

Again, as I said around Line 5 for example, it\u2019s easy to talk about shutting down systems, but it really does have a detrimental effect not just to North Dakota, in this case, but consumers and the entire region. It\u2019s a serious issue that we\u2019re watching closely, but at least we\u2019re in pretty good position."

It seems hydrogen has been getting more attention, could be later dated at this date, but given your nat-gas pipeline network, I imagine you\u2019d be well positioned to capitalize on that. Then as far as offshore wind is concerned, you guys have been very involved in the European side and the supply chain hasn\u2019t quite stood up as well on the U.S. side, so maybe your expertise could be an advantage there.",

            "Overarching that, though, I think from a strategic point of view, Jeremy, the way we\u2019re looking at the renewable space this year, and as I mentioned, we\u2019ve been gradually building this, we know the supply profile is going to change globally for energy. It\u2019s not going to be a quick transition by any stretch, but slowly renewables will be a bigger portion.",
            "At the same time, we\u2019re going to see conventional fuels growing as well, especially natural gas, so we think it makes sense strategically from the point of view of diversifying our capability to have a portion of the assets in renewables, and as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve built that slowly.",
            "You mentioned hydrogen, and it\u2019s a good question because it\u2019s a quite prominent issue today. I will say that Cynthia and her team in the utility have been doing a very good job in getting ahead of the curve on this, and I think we\u2019re well advanced on a couple of ideas, so we\u2019re going to look forward to looking at that, especially as it relates to natural gas. All of this, of course, again going back to Robert\u2019s question, comes back to the commercial fit and whether or not we can make a good risk-adjusted return. ",
            "Before I hand it to Bill, you mentioned the supply chain. I think you\u2019re right about that in the U.S. context, and you\u2019ve got to remember here, I think U.S. offshore wind is certainly an attractive opportunity but, as you point out, the supply chains are not as developed yet, and frankly nor are the regulatory environments as developed as Europe. It\u2019s probably the biggest reason why we\u2019re not involved in U.S. offshore yet.",

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, and Jeremy, you\u2019ve probably heard me talk about this once or twice in the past. If you look at the regions that especially our pipelines serve, we have a great partnership with renewables, so today is a great example. I took the opportunity to look on the ISO website while Al was talking, and wind is 30 megawatts, natural gas is 10,200. You could quadruple the amount of wind as they\u2019re projecting and it\u2019s just--on the peak hours, it\u2019s just not there. Nothing else is, either, so we\u2019ve got a really opportunity just with our gas side to be--especially where we operate in the northeast, to be a very good partner for a long time.",
            "Then you mentioned hydrogen. I think hydrogen is very interesting, so both our utilities [indiscernible] business and ourselves on the natural gas side, we have been studying this. It\u2019s extremely expensive - you know, is it green hydrogen, is it blue hydrogen, how does it interact with the pipelines and the actual steel in the pipeline, and that takes a lot of engineering to look at. But you\u2019re right - the network, and this is decades from now, would be well positioned if hydrogen transitioned from that shiny object that is potentially a solution to a reality.",

I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re bad, it\u2019s just that they\u2019re different than what we shoot for, so I would say low priority."

We\u2019ve filed for all of the environmental permits and the easement permits necessary to do that, and we believe that regulatory process will take about 12 to 18 months to complete. Once we\u2019ve done that, we\u2019ll be able to meet the wishes of the tribe and remove the pipeline from their reservation.",

I know at first glance it looks like an analogous fact pattern, but when we really dig deeper into it, the fact patterns are in fact quite different, where we have been in constant negotiation with the [indiscernible] on our easement and we have not seen the Bureau of Indian Affairs get involved in our pipeline situation with the Bad River band, so while at first they may look similar, I think when you really do a deep dive, the fact patterns are quite different."

I\u2019m sure everyone in the industry is doing this as well, but we\u2019re all over that. I think that\u2019s a positive vector relative to history in this bucket.

The stray crossing is a dual pipeline network where for a period of time, one leg can service our requirements downstream of the straights. We expect to have the east leg up and running hopefully within the next few weeks. We\u2019ve obviously been working with our federal regulator to demonstrate that the pipeline is fit for service and the regulator is working through that right now, once that\u2019s complete, we\u2019ll make an application to the court to have the temporary restraining order amended to allow for the start-up of the east leg, which will then provide redundancy on Line 5. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real magic there from an EBITDA perspective.",

I think ballpark-wise, we can handle a couple hundred thousand barrels a day of incremental flows very easily, and then we\u2019re working on incremental optimizations to allow us to even move more crude should that be required. I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape to be able to take--to offset a lot of the production coming out of the Bakken.",

The reason I\u2019m saying that is because in the end, it\u2019s going to come down to the fundamentals, and if you can be the most competitive system into each one of these markets, the transition is happening but it\u2019s certainly not going to happen over a short period of time.",

We have observed this, we\u2019re participating in it, and we have been extending our maturity through this process as well.

If we can add another percentage to it, I think we\u2019d be pretty happy. The way I look at it is if we can add more there, it certainly would offset some of the things that we might not seeing coming in secured growth beyond 2022. That\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it.",

It sounds like a big number, and it is; but when you break it down by business - you know, Bill\u2019s got lots going on, I mentioned over a billion dollars just in GDS, the utility. Power\u2019s got some projects, liquids can optimize, and frankly if we can get more of the growth rate with these low capital intensive optimizations, expansions or modernizations of the system, and Bill\u2019s is a good example of that, Bill\u2019s area, then I think we can see ourselves getting pretty darn close to that.",

Other considerations, though, aside from the fact that the assets that we have are core to our growth and they\u2019ve got a lot of embedded growth in them, we already return a boatload of capital through the dividend - I think Colin will correct me, it\u2019s probably in the $6.5 billion range annually.",

I know you\u2019re not in the driver\u2019s seat there, but can you clarify when you expect that court decision on the pipe being shut down or not? Is clarity by next week before that initial August 5 deadline reasonable, or could this drag on for another few weeks here?"

Specifically to the last part, there\u2019s nothing different that we expect on Line 3. I think the fundamental there is it\u2019s a state process and we\u2019re right into working with Minnesota, as you know, for quite a while, so I\u2019m not sure that one really plays into the change in administration, if in fact that happens.",
            "It\u2019s always something we contemplate and look at whenever you have a potential administration change. I think the point is, frankly, we work pretty well with all administrations, even the previous one on many fronts. I think it\u2019s probably a little too early to tell, honestly Ben, what the policy implications will be and what it means to infrastructure, but certainly we don\u2019t see any major change, and really that\u2019s because in the end, as I said earlier, it\u2019s pretty clear that our assets are going to be critical to the economic growth in North America. ",
            "A lot of, as I said, what we do falls into that state regulatory and permitting camp, and I guess by the way, Vern, we don\u2019t have any--I guess we\u2019re not seeking any federal cross-border permits at this point, so all in I don\u2019t see it as a big factor. We\u2019re watching it, obviously Ben, but generally we think we\u2019ll be in good shape."

Are you at the point in the next 12 months to put some dollars into some pilot investments? Then also curious, is the study, is it more to gas utilities [indiscernible] are you also talking with Canadian producers more broadly exporting hydrogen on pipes and more of a broader discussion on studying the hydrogen opportunity?

You heard Bill\u2019s comment about how that might work through the gas transmission side. This is all, I think, in the realm of, call it blue hydrogen, and to answer your question, I think yes, we are at the point where we could certainly see putting in small amounts of capital to prove out our understanding of this.

People have been working on it in the company for quite a while, and I think we\u2019ll be in good shape so that when we put in some amounts to test things out which I think is appropriate for us, then we\u2019ll have pretty good confidence around that. Not huge amounts, mind you Ben, but yes, I think we can start to do some pilot investing for sure."
