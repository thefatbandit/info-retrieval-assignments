      "David Michels": [
         "All right. Thank you, Kim. So now, as we\u2019re all aware, this year\u2019s events have had a negative impact on our EBITDA and on our DCF. But as was previously mentioned, we\u2019ve identified capital expenditure reductions, which more than offset the DCF reduction. And so we expect to fully fund all of our cash needs, including our capital expenditures and our dividends within our distributable cash flow.",
         "We also have $950 million of debt maturing in September and another $1.9 billion maturing in the first quarter of next year. But with that said, we had over $500 million of cash on the balance sheet at the second quarter \u2013 at the end of the second quarter and an undrawn $4 billion credit facility. So we have ample liquidity, even accounting for our debt maturities.",
         "Now, moving on to the quarter, we\u2019re declaring a dividend of $0.2625 per share, or $1.05 annualized flat with last quarter. Revenues were down $654 million from the second quarter of 2019, driven in part by lower natural gas prices this quarter versus last year\u2019s quarter. And those lower natural gas prices also drove a decline in associated cost of sales of $336 million. So gross margin, revenue less cost of sales was down $318 million, which is a better indicator of our performance relative to revenue alone.",
         "The loss on impairments and divestitures of $1.005 billion includes $1 billion impairment of our natural gas midstream business, which was driven by a sharp \u2013 the sharp decline that we all saw in natural gas production activity impacting several of our natural gas midstream assets. Due largely to that impairment, our net loss attributable to KMI was $637 million for the quarter.",
         "Adjusted earnings, which is our non-GAAP term for net income adjusted for certain items, and that certain items this quarter is comprised mainly of that impairment just discussed.",
         "Our adjusted earnings were $381 million, down $112 million compared to the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.17 for the quarter, which is down $0.05 from the prior period.",
         "Moving on to distributable cash flow performance. Natural Gas segment was down $55 million for the quarter. The sale of Cochin drove most \u2013 more than half of that lower contribution. Additionally, various gathering and processing systems experienced lower activity and our Tennessee Gas Pipe was down due to 501-G impacts and mild weather. Partially offsetting those were contributions from \u2013 greater contributions from Elba Liquefaction and Gulf Coast Express projects.",
         "Products was down $80 million, driven by lower refined product volume, as well as lower crude and condensate volume. Terminals was down $61 million. This was also partially driven by the sale of KML, as well as lower refined product, coal and steel volumes.",
         "CO2 segment was down $28 million, driven by lower CO2 and oil volumes, partially offset by cost savings. Our general and administrative and corporate charges were higher by $5 million due to lower capitalized overhead, partially offset by some lower non-cash pension expenses, as well as the sale of KML.",
         "JV, DD&A and NCI, this $20 million of reductions are explained mainly by our partner sharing in the Elba Liquefaction\u2019s greater contributions. And that explains the main changes in adjusted EBITDA, which was $249 million, or 14% lower than the second quarter of last year.",
         "Interest expense was lower by $59 million, driven by lower floating rates benefiting our interest rate swaps, as well as a lower overall debt balance, partially offset by lower capitalized interest. Recall we used the proceeds from our KML and Cochin sales to reduce debt.",
         "Cash taxes lower by $46 million due to deferred tax payments at Citrus, Plantation, a deferral of our Texas margin tax and the sale of KML, which was a taxpaying entity. Those deferrals are only to later in 2020. For the full-year, cash taxes are in line with our budget.",
         "Sustaining capital was $31 million lower versus Q2 of 2019, and total DCF of $1.001 billion is down $127 million, or 11%. DCF per share was $0.44 per share, down $0.06 from last year.",
         "So to summarize the distributable cash flow impacts, segments were down $224 million. We had lower capitalized overhead of $24 million. Greater cash pension contributions of $18 million, partially offset by lower interest, taxes and sustaining capital of $135 million, and that gets you just over $130 million of the $127 million change.",
         "Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter at 4.5 times debt-to-EBITDA, up from the 4.3 times we had last quarter and at year-end 2019. Our net debt ended the quarter at $32.4 billion, which is down $622 million from year-end and $153 million lower than last quarter. As Rich mentioned, but it\u2019s worth pointing out again, our net debt has now declined by about $10 billion since the third quarter of 2015.",
         "So to reconcile the quarter change in net debt, we generated just over $1 billion of DCF. We paid out $600 million of dividends. We spent $500 million on growth capital and JV contributions, and we generated $250 million of working capital source of cash. And that explains the majority of the $153 million change for the quarter.",
         "Reconciling from year-end, the lower \u2013 $622 million of lower net debt, we generated $2.262 billion of distributable cash flow. We received a little more than $900 million from the Pembina share sale. We paid out $1.17 billion of dividends. We spent $1 billion on growth capital and contributions to JVs. We we paid $160 million of taxes on deferred Trans Mountain and Pembina share sales. We bought back $50 million of KMI shares and we had $150 million use of working capital changes, and that explains the majority of the $622 million.",
         "Finally, as Kim mentioned, there\u2019s still plenty of uncertainty for the remainder of the year. So as we did last quarter, we\u2019ve provided a table with sensitivities to some of those assumptions that remain uncertain, so you guys can model accordingly. Also, consistent with last quarter, we posted a supplemental slide deck to our website, which provides some helpful information on our assets, customers and contract mix.",
         "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve."
      ],
      "Kimberly Allen Dang": [
         "Okay. Thanks, Steve. I\u2019ll go through a review of each of the business segments, as well as a high-level summary of our current full-year forecast. So first, starting with the business units and natural gas.",
         "Natural gas transport volumes were up about 3%, or approximately 940,000 dekatherms per day versus the second quarter of 2019. That was driven by GCX, which went into service last September; TGP, due to increased LNG deliveries; CIG, due to heating demand and DJ Basin production; and volumes on our Texas intrastate due to demand growth.",
         "Physical deliveries to LNG facilities off of our pipelines were up over 900 per day versus Q2 2019, but they were down significantly versus the first quarter of this year. Exports to Mexico were flat in the second quarter when compared to the second quarter of 2019. Deliveries to power plants were up about 6%, driven by coal switching and warmer weather. And LDC demand on our system was down approximately 7%. Industrial demand was relatively flat.",
         "Our gathering volumes were down about 8% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2019. They were down 9% compared to Q1 of this year. KinderHawk, which serves the Haynesville and the \u2013 and our Oklahoma assets were down due to the lack of drilling and the decline in existing wells. Volumes on our Hiland system, which is in the Bakken, were down due to production shut-ins.",
         "In general, what we\u2019re seeing in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken is that volumes bottomed out in May and June, respectively, with some increase in volumes thereafter, as producers started to bring back shut-in production. In the Haynesville, which did not have the shut-ins we saw in the associated plays, we expect continued volume decline this year due to the lack of drilling. However, we continue to have conversations with producers about incremental volumes in 2021, given the current natural gas price curve.",
         "In our Products Pipelines segment, refined products volumes were down about 31% for the quarter versus the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the pandemic and about the same percentage versus plan. So that\u2019s slightly better than the 40% that we projected for the second quarter and our Q1 call.",
         "Volumes versus our budget were down over 40% in April, and then we saw recovery in May and again in June. And so in June, they were down about 24% versus our budget. Currently, volumes in our Products Pipeline are down roughly 15% and that\u2019s really depending on the market.",
         "Crude and condensate volumes were down about 26% in the quarter. Here, we saw the largest decline in May versus April for refined products, with the weakness largely carrying into June. These volumes were weaker in Q2 than what we projected for you in our Q1 call, largely offsetting the better refined products volumes. In July, we started to see some recoveries as producers have brought some shut-in production back online with a recovery in oil price.",
         "In terminals, we experienced declines in our refined product throughput of about 24%. So slightly better than what we saw in our Products Pipeline, and that\u2019s just driven by the different markets that we serve. However, the financial impact of the volume decline is more moderate in this segment, given the primarily take-or-pay contract structure.",
         "One bright spot in the midst of the pandemic has been the demand for tankage. Currently, we have approximately 99% of our tankage under contract. In CO2, oil production was down approximately 13%. Over 20% of that reduction was associated with production curtailments that we instituted when prices dropped below about $20 a barrel.",
         "With improved prices, we\u2019ve restarted the majority of that production without operational issues or impacts to the reservoir. CO2 volumes were down about 31% in the quarter. Overall, CO2 demand in Southwest Colorado is at a level that we haven\u2019t seen since 2004. However, we expect to see some rebound as oil prices improve.",
         "For the full-year, we\u2019re projecting to come in slightly below the guidance we gave you in the first quarter of approximately 8% below budget on EBITDA and approximately 10% below budget on DCF.",
         "A number of you are going to ask on the follow-up calls what slightly means? So right now, we estimate we\u2019re about 9% and 11%, respectively, on EBITDA and DCF. But that implies much more accuracy and specificity than what we really have in these highly uncertain times and thus our guidance of slightly below.",
         "The slight deterioration that we\u2019ve seen since the first quarter has all been in midstream natural gas due to the lower gathering volumes in the Bakken, the Haynesville and Eagle Ford. Producer bankruptcies and softer market fundamentals impacting our Texas Intrastate business.",
         "Our forecast for refined product demand for the balance of the year assumes volumes are down 11% to 12% in Q3 and 5% in Q4 versus our budget, and that\u2019s largely unchanged from what we projected for you in our first quarter call.",
         "For natural gas gathering volumes, we\u2019re projecting volumes for the second-half of the year, on average, to be relatively flat versus what we saw in the second quarter. This equates to down approximately 12% versus the second-half of 2019 and down approximately 20% versus our budget for the second-half of the year. This is a change from what we projected in Q1. And as I mentioned previously, one of the drivers of our slightly lower guidance.",
         "We\u2019ve continued to look for expense reductions to offset the volume and price impacts that we can realize without sacrificing safety or compliance. Incorporated in our guidance is the $170 million of cost savings between OpEx, G&A and sustaining CapEx that Steve mentioned in his comments.",
         "We\u2019re now projecting that year-end debt-to-EBITDA will round up to 4.7 times due to the EBITDA deterioration. We continue to operate in a highly uncertain and changing environment. It is difficult to predict what will happen. Certainly, at the time we announced our Q1 earnings, no one was predicting the COVID outbreak that we\u2019ve seen \u2013 that we\u2019re seeing in Texas, Florida, Arizona and California.",
         "As we did last quarter, Table 8 of the press release provides you with sensitivities around the biggest moving pieces of our forecast, so that if things change, you can calculate the impact on our business.",
         "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to David Michels."

      "Operator": [
         "Welcome to the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] I would like to inform all parties that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objection, you may disconnect at this time.",
         "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Thank you."
      ],
      "Richard Kinder": [
         "Thank you, Denise. As usual, before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that KMI\u2019s earnings release today and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.",
         "Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release, as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking statements.",
         "Now, as I always do on these calls, let me talk briefly about our financial strategy at Kinder Morgan. To say that these are unprecedented times for the American economy is an understatement and particularly for the energy business. We faced the continued impact of COVID-19, together with the negative effect that virus has had on worldwide demand for most of the products we move through our pipelines and handle at our terminals.",
         "So the question is, what should our financial strategy be in the face of these black swan events? Actually, in our judgment, the response is pretty similar to the approach we\u2019ve been using for the last few years. We will continue to prioritize returning value to our shareholders, while maintaining a solid investment-grade balance sheet.",
         "Specific to our balance sheet, we are fortunate to have paid down approximately $10 billion in debt since 2015. We\u2019re also fortunate to have assets that throw off substantial cash flow, even under adverse circumstances. We need to live within that cash flow by funding all dividends and expansion CapEx from those internal \u2013 from these internally generated funds. We\u2019re doing that today and expect to accumulate cash in excess of our dividends and our CapEx, even in the challenging year of 2020.",
         "As previously announced, we reduced our expected expansion budget by about 30% this year and are also reducing our operating expenses and sustaining CapEx, which Steve and Kim will talk about in just a few minutes. We\u2019ve raised our dividend payout and expect to do more in that regard when normal economic conditions return.",
         "Looking beyond 2020, we believe we are operating in a maturing business segment and that our opportunities for viable expansion projects will likely be significantly less than we have experienced over the last several years. If that expectation proves accurate, they will probably reduce our growth potential, but will allow us to husband [ph] significant cash flow that we can use to increase our dividend, pay down debt and/or buy back shares under the right conditions.",
         "Our goal is to be disciplined in every respect. That means being very careful in high grading potential capital expansion expenditures and keeping a focus on operating our assets in the most efficient way possible.",
         "Now, most investors we talk with, whether generally positive or not on the KMI story, believe that given our size, attractive assets and relatively strong balance sheet, we will be a long-term survivor. With that in view, they see us as a potential consolidator in the midstream area.",
         "Let me say that while we would never rule out a potential M&A transaction, we will not undertake such action to the detriment of our balance sheet. Beyond that, it would have to be accretive to our distributable cash flow.",
         "One final thought. In unsettled times like these, the famous quote of Mark Twain comes to mind. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to make predictions, particularly about the future.\u201d That said, I believe in this kind of environment, staying power and maintaining a long-term outlook are keys to long-term success and the delivery of real value to our shareholders.",
         "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve."
      ],
      "Steven Kean": [
         "All right. Thanks, Rich. I\u2019ll give you an overview of our business, including the coronavirus situation. I\u2019ll give you an update on our Permian Highway Pipeline project. I\u2019ll also provide some color on the organizational announcement that we\u2019re making today. Then I\u2019ll turn it over to Kim Dang to cover the outlook and segment updates. And then our CFO, David Michels, will take you through the financials, then we\u2019ll take your questions.",
         "In times like these, it\u2019s especially important for us to keep our priorities and principles in mind. Our priorities throughout the COVID response has been to keep our employees safe and to keep our businesses running. We operate infrastructure that is essential to businesses and communities across the country. We need to keep our assets running and we have.",
         "To protect our employees, we instituted telecommuting for our offices and that\u2019s worked astonishingly well. We also made changes in our field operations to enable our coworkers to do their work, while maintaining appropriate physical distance. In a few cases where distancing was not possible, we enhanced our PPE requirements. It\u2019s working, all of our assets are running, and we\u2019re keeping our coworkers safe while they are at work.",
         "Community spread has continued and it\u2019s affecting us, particularly in our Houston area locations. But telecommuting and the other precautions we are taking have allowed us to maintain effective, safe, reliable operations, while largely keeping our coworkers from contracting or spreading the virus while at work.",
         "Our financial principles remain the same. First, maintaining a strong balance sheet. Second, we are maintaining our capital discipline through our return criteria, a good track record of execution and by self-funding our investments. On that front, we evaluated all of our 2020 expansion capital projects and reduced CapEx by about $660 million from our 2020 budget in response to the changing conditions in our markets.",
         "We still have over $1.7 billion of expansion capital in 2020 on good project investments and a backlog of $2.9 billion, 71% of which is a natural gas. We\u2019re also maintaining cost discipline. We now stand at nearly $170 million of expense in sustaining capital costs savings for 2020, including deferrals, up from $125 million that we reported to you in April.",
         "The result of this work on our capital budget and our costs is that our projected DCF less discretionary capital spend has actually improved versus our plan, notwithstanding the pandemic and notwithstanding the degradation to our forecast which more than offset the degradation to our forecast with spending cuts in 2020.",
         "Finally, we are returning value to shareholders with a 5% year-over-year dividend increase to $1.05 annualized, providing an increased, but well covered dividend. Strong balance sheet, capital and cost discipline and returning value to shareholders, those are the principles we continue to operate by.",
         "We continue to make very good progress on our Permian Highway Pipeline project, which is supported by long-term contracts with a take-or-pay structure. Construction is proceeding very well. And we are now nearly 80% mechanically complete on the pipeline, actually, 79% as of this morning, and we\u2019re 97% complete on our mainline compression. We still expect to be fully in service in early 2021.",
         "Permitting delays preconstruction and some additional land acquisition and river crossing costs have impacted returns, but we are still looking at a strong double-digit unlevered after-tax return on this project.",
         "Our team has continued to overcome obstacles and the number of remaining obstacles has shrunk considerably, particularly in light of the Supreme Court decision to stay the injunction against the Army Corps Nationwide Rule 12 permitting process, but also as a result of adjustments the team has made in routing and construction.",
         "The other topic I want to touch on is the organizational changes that we made today. James Holland has been appointed Chief Operating Officer reporting to Kim. James has a long successful history at Kinder Morgan, including most recently as President of our Products Pipeline Group.",
         "We asked James to take on the leadership of our ongoing ESG and operational excellence initiatives. Also, we have asked James to lead our examination of cost effective changes in our organizational structure. Our management team is in the midst of an effort to determine how we operate and is considering centralizing certain functions in order to be more efficient and effective.",
         "We are already an efficient and lean organization. But we are always looking to do better, especially in today\u2019s challenging environment. We believe that cost effectiveness is one of the keys to long-term success in our sector. It\u2019s essential to be cost-effective, while also maintaining our commitment to safe and compliant operations, that\u2019s embedded in our values, our culture, and in how we put the budget together.",
         "The management team is committed to these objectives, and James will help make us \u2013 make sure that we meet them. We expect to conclude this review concurrent with the preparation of our 2021 budget.",
         "We also announced Dax Sanders will take over as President of our Products Pipeline Group. Dax has had a long successful career here, too, has been first Chair on our acquisition and divestiture activity for over the last seven years. More than being the corporate development guy though, Dax has also been a key player in every significant strategic decision we have made.",
         "Now, he will bring his skills and experience to bear on leading a business unit and working with a great team in our Products Pipeline segment. Kevin Grahmann will take over Dax\u2019s role in corporate development, and he will do a great job. We won\u2019t miss a beat.",
         "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kim.",
         "All right. Thank you. And I\u2019ll remind everybody that as a courtesy to all the callers, we\u2019ll limit the questions per person to one question with one follow-up. But if you have additional unanswered questions, get back in the queue and we will get back around to you.",
         "So with that, Denise, if you would open it up for questions."

            "Thanks for taking my question. Just want to start off on the CapEx comments, I think, that you began the call with here. I\u2019m just wondering if you could provide any more color, I guess, what you think of sustaining rate of CapEx would be kind of in 2021 or plus. Just trying to get a feel there for what the opportunity set is and how you think about that versus free cash flow and type of returns you can get? I think, the EBITDA multiple that you guys quoted this quarter was 5.8 versus 5.6 in the past. So just trying to see how this all fits together?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Jeremy Tonet"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So we had previously talked about being in the range and we\u2019ve been in this range for about 10 years of $2 billion to $3 billion a year of capital expansion opportunities that would manifest, that we would pursue and get along our system because of the network we have and because of the broader dynamics in U.S. energy.",
            "Certainly, what we\u2019ve seen this year with everything that\u2019s happened, both in energy and in broader markets, is those opportunities reduced. And so we\u2019ve been very disciplined and reacted quickly to what we saw there and we took a substantial amount of capital out. And so we\u2019re now sitting this year at $1.7 billion.",
            "And so, Jeremy, we don\u2019t know where that number is going to be. But I think, if you look at, let\u2019s call it the next few years kind of outlook as it looks from standing here today, that number looks like it doesn\u2019t get to the $2 billion to $3 billion. In fact, it looks like it hangs around the level we\u2019re seeing in 2020, maybe a little less.",
            "And so \u2013 but the way we\u2019ll generate that capital investment opportunities is the same way we always have, which is we\u2019ll go look for investment opportunities that are attractive to our shareholders, but we\u2019ll have a high hurdle on it, particularly in this day and time. What \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to build linear infrastructure, you have to have margin of safety in any investment that you\u2019re thinking about making.",
            "So we\u2019ll have a high hurdle rate, give ourselves substantial headroom and margin for safety above our weighted average cost of capital. It\u2019s got to be something we\u2019re confident we can deliver, get permitted, et cetera, on time and on budget.",
            "And as Rich mentioned at the very beginning, it\u2019s an increasingly more difficult time to get linear infrastructure built. And so all of that goes into, I think, guiding you to a forward view on expansion capital that\u2019s below what our historical run rate has been."

         "Speaker": "Steven Kean"
      },
      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And I would add consistent with what Steve is saying that, of course, as I said at the beginning, it cuts both ways, but it certainly helps us in terms of looking at our cash flow. If you just think of producing $4.5 billion of distributable cash flow and then take out $1.5 billion, you\u2019re left with $3 billion. The dividends at the current rate are a little less than $2.5 billion. So you have several hundred million dollars in that very rough pro forma, several hundred million dollars of cash flow above self-funding of the dividend and all of the expansion CapEx."

         "Remarks": [

      },
      "8": {
         "Remarks": [
            "That\u2019s very helpful. Maybe picking up on that last point, Rich, the several hundred million of free cash flow you talked about there. You see that leverage kind of stepped up a little bit versus what you guys had thought about before. And just want to confirm there\u2019s no need for equity or anything like that. You guys are still in good standings with the agencies here.",
            "And as you think about where to put those several hundred million, it seems like leverage \u2013 deleveraging would be kind of a top priority versus buybacks or other options. Just wondering if you could update us on deleveraging buybacks and how that all kind of fits together\u2026?"

As we pointed out multiple times here, we go through a pretty detailed budget review that takes a look at what \u2013 how markets are shaping up and looks at everything commercially and also looks at our costs on a bottoms-up basis as well. That\u2019s going to be an enhanced review on the cost side this year. And it\u2019s just hard to say right now.",
            "Now we can observe the same macro factors that you have and some of this ties back to what we discussed on the capital side of things, which is the producer community is in a different situation even than what it was in, in 2016.",
            "There\u2019s not as much capital available to it. There\u2019s a lot more emphasis on free cash flow that tends to \u2013 that would tend to dampen what expectations would be for U.S. energy production. And we\u2019ve kind of got to make up for what we lost this year before you begin to see it grow again.",
            "And so I think this \u2013 the overall \u2013 everything that\u2019s happened in energy has kind of pushed the return to growth out a couple of years. And who knows beyond that, right? And so, I think, generally speaking, the opportunity to deploy additional capital or deploy capital at our historic levels, as we\u2019ve said several times now, it\u2019s just not likely at this point from our perspective.",
            "So we think we\u2019re going to be looking at a lower expansion capital spend, and that has pluses, but also minuses. Meaning that, there\u2019s EBITDA at the good return that we set as a hurdle for our investment decisions. That means that there\u2019s an EBITDA that we would have normally expected to get that we\u2019re not going to get if we\u2019re not deploying capital at higher levels.",

Just wanted to get your thoughts on, given the trough valuation for midstream assets in today\u2019s market, the smaller size of your growth backlog and challenges in building new assets that you have pointed out. If you were to pursue M&A, what asset or geography would be of interest?"

And doing something that hurts the balance sheet, hurts the balance sheet metrics is really not something that we\u2019re interested in. And so we\u2019re going to be \u2013 we\u2019re going to jealously guard that. And then also, we would need to see good value in terms of DCF per share accretion as a result.",

Well, certainly, in terms of cost synergies, but also in terms of other strategic synergies, whether those are capital or pieces of the business that we could put together and make better and then you\u2019ve got to find something that\u2019s transactable.",
            "And so there\u2019s \u2013 there are a number of screens that have to clear. And so you can\u2019t predict it, and we\u2019ve said that for years now. People have been projecting consolidation in our sector for, I don\u2019t know, six or seven years, something like that. I mean, people think it\u2019s more right now, but we\u2019ve been thinking that it\u2019s right for a while. So those things remain just very hard to call. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re interested in, but it\u2019s got to meet those criteria that we laid out."

Would you be able to discuss the latest strategic rationale that KMI has been owning and operating the CO2 business with a CNP profile? We saw a renewed interest in this area, given the major independent deal announced earlier this week. So really, the question is do you have interest in monetizing that business?

It\u2019s something that we know how to do and how to run.",
            "And Jesse and his team have done really a magnificent job looking hard at the capital and have actually improved the free cash flow coming from that business unit versus what was in the budget with everything that\u2019s happened. And so as a result of cost savings and also capital, either deferrals or reductions, they\u2019ve just done a great job. So I feel like we know what we\u2019re doing in that niche business.",
            "The other consideration or the other element of context to consider is that, it\u2019s a bit of a unique business, right? Enhanced oil recovery, a lot of that is about having the pipeline infrastructure owning the CO2, which we do, knowing what to do with it when you put it in the ground. It\u2019s not a shale play or conventional play.",
            "And so I think just naturally, that tends to limit the market. But look, we do what\u2019s in our shareholders\u2019 best interest. This is a business that we can handle well in terms of its overall part of the Kinder Morgan picture. The EOR part of that business is now and you\u2019ll see this in the updated investor presentation slides posted on the website is now at 3% of our segment EBITDA.

The language in the press releases is still pretty strong on being committed to $1.25. So can you give more color on the criteria you\u2019re looking at to raise it to that level potentially by year-end? Is it just refined products volumes going back to normal? Do you need to see midstream and other businesses start recovering?",

We said at that time, we would see how the year played out. And when we return to normalcy, we \u2013 our long-term intention is to take that dividend up to the $1.25 target.",
            "That said, as I said, it\u2019s almost very difficult to predict what\u2019s going to happen between now and then. But we tried to be very careful with the language in the earnings release, and sort of enumerating the factors that we\u2019re going to consider. But the thing \u2013 the real thinking is to ascertain whether we have a return to normal economic conditions.",
            "And one of the advantages of making this decision at the January Board meeting is, by that time, we will have had full access to a detailed 2021 budget. Our Board will be able to look at that and decide in view of that budget, looking ahead, what makes the most sense.",
            "We\u2019re clearly very cognizant of our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We want to maintain a strong balance sheet. We\u2019re very happy we can self-fund all of our expansion CapEx and the dividend. And we want two things for certain. We want adequate coverage of that dividend. And we want to make damn certain that once we do a dividend increase, that dividend increase is permanent, and that we\u2019re not retracting that at some later date.",

So we have one of our spreads. We\u2019re standing at, like 87% cleared. And we\u2019re kind of standing by until we get to August 1, and we\u2019re free to clear the remainder. And we should be able to do that based on our experience today. We should be able to do that effectively and with adequate mitigation of impacts to the oak trees, et cetera.",

And that process is also well underway. And so we think we see a pretty clear line of sight. Now there is litigation around this pipeline.",
            "As we said, again, we\u2019re very encouraged that the Supreme Court stayed the injunction of all Nationwide 12 permits for oil and gas projects, the decision that came out of the Montana Court. That removes \u2013 that \u2013 it didn\u2019t cause us to stop construction, but it removes a lot of uncertainty around the legal aspects of this, the sustainability of Nationwide Rule 12. And so we\u2019re grateful to see that.",

That\u2019s why I alluded to the team\u2019s work, certain construction measures that will allow us to avoid impacting waters of the U.S. and to reduce the number of crossings of navigable waters that we need to do.",
            "So we\u2019ve taken some steps and some actions on our own in order to strengthen our position. Nationwide Rule 12 is something we need, as I said, for certain construction activities. It\u2019s not what we need to operate. So we\u2019ll get this work done. We believe we\u2019ll get this work done. We\u2019ll be up and running and put it in service for our customers at the end of \u2013 or at the very beginning of 2021."

            "We think that there\u2019s some room and we are commenting to get them to consider that adder a little more carefully and at a minimum separate the text component out. So that hopefully, we can take advantage of our current status in that regard.",
