         "Thank you, Jacob, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome you to Western Forest Products\u2019 2020 second quarter conference call. Joining me on the call today is Stephen Williams, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.",
         "We issued our 2020 second quarter results yesterday. I\u2019ll provide you with some introductory comments, and then ask Steve to take you through a summary of our financial results. I\u2019ll then share with you our outlook and discuss recent developments in our industry. We will then take your questions.",
         "Let me start the call by acknowledging our employees and contractors for their commitment to health and safety during this challenging and uncertain time. Their adoption of the strict health and safety protocols that our company implemented at the onset of the COVID-19 have not only kept our employees, contractors and community safe, but their efforts have been instrumental in enabling us to reestablish our business after the lengthy USW Strike.",
         "Our strategic investments in information technology over the past several years has allowed us to work remotely, while ensuring we remain connected, both internally and with our customers around the world. As we navigate through the challenges presented by COVID-19, we will continue to provide all the support necessary to keep our employees, contractors and communities healthy and safe.",
         "Moving on to our second quarter results. Despite the uncertain operating environment caused by COVID-19 and operational challenges resulting from the restart of operations after the lengthy USW Strike, we generated $29.5 million of adjusted EBITDA. This year\u2019s results were much improved from the $15 million generated in the same quarter last year.",
         "I\u2019m pleased we were able to successfully deliver solid financial results in the second quarter of 2020, while overcoming the impacts caused by COVID-19 and despite the operational challenges associated with the restart of our BC operations, the consumption of Strike-impacted logs, and having been unable to participate in the spring buy due to the Strike.",
         "As we continue to navigate through these uncertain times, we\u2019ll remain focused on aligning our production volumes to match market demand, while first and foremost, ensuring the health and safety of our employees.",
         "I\u2019ll now turn it over to Steve to review our key financial results.",
         "Great. Thanks, Steve. I\u2019d like to start off outlook section by touching on third quarter seasonality. Typical third quarters can be challenging operationally, as hot dry weather can restrict logging activity, reducing harvest volumes and impacting costs.",
         "As our coastal forests dry out, we shift to less productive early morning operating hours to reduce fire risk. So far, we\u2019ve had a productive first month of harvesting, but conditions can change quickly as we head into the late summer.",
         "Turning to our markets. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, government actions to limit the spread of the virus created significant demand disruptions. In response, many lumber producers curtailed operations. As governments began to ease restrictions, lumber consumption quickly improved, particularly in North America. Rising demand has outpaced supply.",
         "The resulting supply demand imbalances led to significant price increases, especially for commodity lumber. Lumber demand in our key export markets has not experienced the same sharp rebound as in North America. As a result, we\u2019re directing a component of our lumber production to North American product lines to take advantage of the improved pricing environment.",
         "Demand and pricing for our Western Red Cedar products in North America improved through the quarter led by the Home Centre segment. We expect demand in North America to remain strong in the third quarter, which is traditionally a slower period for Western Red Cedar lumber sales.",
         "Demand for Niche lumber products targeted to the treating segment in North America have remained strong, while demand for timbers consumed in the industrial segment has slowed.",
         "In Japan, lumber demand has weakened due to declining housing starts and COVID-19-related challenges. As demand has fallen, market pricing has become more competitive. In response to the weaker demand for our products, we may direct certain Japan-destined volume to the North American market.",
         "In the export log market during the second quarter, COVID-19 shutdowns in New Zealand and Europe impacted log supply to China. We expect European and New Zealand log supply to return to pre-shutdown levels leading to a more competitive price environment as we go forward. The recent strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar may impact certain log and lumber realizations in the third quarter.",
         "We expect domestic log prices to improve slightly in the third quarter, supported by increased demand from local manufacturers. In contrast, we expect pricing for pulp logs to remain under pressure until demand for pulp and paper improves and the pulp and paper mills return to full production.",
         "In the second quarter of 2020, we launched new product branding to increase our presence in the Home Center and Pro-Dealer sales channels. The new branding will support the strategic marketing and vendor purchase agreements we reached with customers in the first quarter.",
         "We expect to see more fulsome benefits of these marketing initiatives as we move forward, supporting us in growing sales volumes in order to capitalize on the growth in the repair and remodeling segment.",
         "As we look forward, the potential resurgence of COVID-19 cases around the globe may lead to the reintroduction of restrictions that could impact lumber demand. We plan to utilize our flexible operating platform to adjust the market conditions and will continue to align our production volumes to match our customers\u2019 needs.",
         "I\u2019d like to provide you an update on a couple of developments now in the industry. In January of this year, the BC government announced changes to the manufacturing forest product regulation. The amendments to the regulation require Western Red Cedar and yellow Cedar lumber to be fully manufactured to be eligible for export.",
         "In June, the province announced the deferral of the regulation\u2019s implementation to September 30 of this year. The province also updated the regulation to only apply to the BC coast. We continue to work and engage with the government to ensure that the desired outcome is met without unintended consequences to our global customers or employment in BC.",
         "The final policy is yet to be released. But the regulation could have negative implications for global customers of BC Cedar products, who through their purchases support thousands of jobs and communities on the coast of BC. It could also have a negative implications on the coastal lumber business that is already being disproportionately impacted by the application of duties on our high-priced cedar shipments to the United States.",
         "Moving on to the softwood lumber dispute, in July, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced an extension for the first Administrative Duty Review. As a result, the determination of final countervailing and antidumping duty rates for 2017 and 2018 are not expected until November 2020. Currently, Western has over US$78 million on deposit with the US Treasury, which at the current exchange rate is approximately C$105 million.",
         "Looking to what\u2019s next. Our top priority remains the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities. We will continue to adapt our procedures and protocols as necessary to ensure we keep our people safe.",
         "We also remain focused on maintaining financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet. We\u2019ll continue to review capital allocation on a quarterly basis with our Board, but our near-term focus remains on reducing debt.",
         "Despite the near-term uncertainty, we remain focused on growing our lumber production and implementing our strategic initiatives to strengthen our foundation, grow our base and grow our business over the long-term.",
         "With that, Jacob, I can open up the call for questions."

         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Western Forest Products Second Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. During this conference call, Western\u2019s representatives may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws. These statements can be identified by words like anticipate, plan, estimate, will and other references to future periods.",
         "Although these forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s reasonable beliefs, expectations and assumptions, they are subject to inherent uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. There are many factors that could cause actual outcomes to be different, including those factors described under risks and uncertainties in the company\u2019s annual MD&A, which can be accessed on SEDAR and is supplemented by the company\u2019s quarterly MD&A.",
         "Forward-looking statements are based only on information currently available to Western and speak only as of the date on which they are made. Except as required by law, Western undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements. Accordingly, listeners should exercise caution in relying upon forward-looking statements.",
         "I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Don Demens, President and CEO of Western Forest Products. Mr. Demens, please go ahead."

      "Stephen Williams": [
         "Thanks, Don. My comments will focus primarily on our financial results for the second quarter of 2020 by comparison to the second quarter of last year. We reported second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $29.5 million, as compared to $15.1 million in the same period of 2019.",
         "Results in the quarter benefited from improved lumber and log markets towards the end of the quarter, favorable coastal harvesting conditions, strategically accessing logs that were staged prior to the Strike to reduce per unit harvesting costs, and accessing the emergency wage program to support employment and communities.",
         "These benefits were partially offset by a weaker log sales mix, lower byproduct revenues and higher per unit manufacturing costs due to restart of operations and production inefficiencies from consuming log inventory that had degraded during the Strike.",
         "Lumber revenue decreased by 19% compared to the same period last year due to lower shipment volumes. This was partially offset by a higher specialty product mix and the benefits from a weaker Canadian to U.S. dollar.",
         "Specialty lumber shipments represented 64% of second quarter shipments, compared to 57% in the second quarter of 2019. Log revenue decreased 4% compared to the same period last year. We capitalized on an improved log market late in the second quarter to deliver increased shipments as compared to the same period last year.",
         "However, average log price realizations declined due to a weaker sales mix and degraded log quality as a result of the Strike. Byproduct revenue decreased 48% due to lower chip sales volumes and lower realized pricing.",
         "Freight expense decreased by $6.3 million from the same period last year due to lower shipment volumes. Duty expense decreased by $2.1 million from the same period last year due to reduced U.S.-destined lumber shipment volumes.",
         "At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $105 million of duties on deposit. Lumber production decreased 31% compared to the same period last year. We operated fewer shifts and production efficiency was impacted by log inventory that it degraded during the Strike. This also resulted in higher per unit manufacturing costs compared to the same period last year.",
         "Log production in the second quarter of 2020 was 2% lower than the same period last year. Log production gradually increased through the second quarter of 2020, overcoming modified operating procedures to mitigate COVID-19 risks and capitalizing on favorable coastal operating conditions.",
         "Our BC coastal per unit harvests costs decreased from the same period last year as we strategically accessed logs that have been staged prior to Strike. We also reduced tire costs, helicopter logging volumes and limited road expenditures. From a profit and loss perspective, net income was $8.5 million, as compared to a net loss of $0.7 million in the second quarter of 2019.",
         "Looking at second quarter cash flow and capital management. Cash provided by operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital during the second quarter of 2020 was $38.5 million, as compared to $4.5 million in the same period last year. The second quarter of 2020 benefited from the receipt of income tax refunds of $11.4 million.",
         "In the second quarter of 2020, non-cash working capital increased by $46.3 million. Non-cash working capital increased as we rebuilt inventories as we resumed Strike-curtailed BC operations and as shipments accelerated through the end of June with improving market demand.",
         "Cash used in investing activities was $3.9 million during the second quarter of 2020, as compared to $14.9 million during the same period last year. We reduced our capital spending in order to address uncertainty caused by COVID-19.",
         "Last quarter, we announced the suspension of our quarterly dividend to address uncertainty caused by COVID-19. And as a result, we did not make a dividend distribution in the second quarter of 2020. Our liquidity at the end of the second quarter was $95.1 million and our net debt to capitalization ratio was approximately 25%. Liquidity remains a key priority and a near-term focus.",
         "Working capital typically reaches a seasonal high at the end of the second quarter. We expect to receive a total of $18 million in the third quarter of 2020 from income tax refunds in the Canadian Emergency Wage program. We will continue to explore opportunities to strengthen our liquidity. We expect sufficient liquidity to be available to meet our ongoing obligations.",
         "Don, that concludes my comments."

Can you give us an order of magnitude and what we can expect for that from a volume perspective in Q3 and maybe even into Q4? And then context on specific grades and end markets, you\u2019re going to push that product into?"

      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Sure. Well good morning, Sean. So, I think, first off, we already do a significant amount of business in North America from our appearance products used in molding and millwork to Cedar targeted at the home centers and outdoor living. We do ceder appearance timbers, yellow cedar in the \u2013 and glulam and the lam stock. And we have a pretty strong position in North America, at least in our region, in the treating and industrial segments.",
            "We also do some products for the construction segment in both dimension and timbers. So it\u2019s along with like the products directed to the treating segment and the construction segment is where we expect to grow volume in the next couple of quarters and redirect volume.",
            "Most of the volume is going to be redirected from Japan and from China. I think we\u2019d estimate maybe about 10% to 15% additional volume being directed this quarter to North America. And I guess, from our perspective, this ability to redirect volume underscores the benefits of the flexible operating platform we\u2019ve got and should allow us to participate in the improved pricing environment we\u2019re seeing in North America as opposed to some of the export markets."

      "6": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Makes sense. The TFL 19 decision to lower volumes for you guys or the expectation that, that\u2019ll be the case. I guess, the expected ease you would have to replace that 130,000 cubic meters on the open market. Do you expect that this all have any bearing on your sawmill operations at all?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Sean Steuart"
      },
      "7": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So to be directional, no, we don\u2019t think it will have any bearing on the sawmill operations. And we\u2019ve purchased well over 1 million meters in a typical year and having the volume being reduced in 19 \u2013 TFL 19 shouldn\u2019t have an impact on sawmills. I mean, maybe just to provide you a little context and for \u2013 the TFL 19 is located on the west side of Vancouver Island.",
            "But like every one of our 10 years, every 10 years, the Chief Forester of the province is required to review the tenures and determine a sustainable annual lumber [ph] cut that allows us to harvest in perpetuity. To do this, they do a detailed analysis of growth rates and harvest and then take into account any reductions or deductions from the timber harvesting land base due to government land use decisions and set asides.",
            "That\u2019s basically what\u2019s occurred here. And what they\u2019ve determined is most of the reduction is due to natural decline, which means there\u2019s less volume per hectare than, say, from old forest to new forests. It just so happens the reduction we anticipate will somewhat be in line with the harvest we\u2019ve had over the past period of time. It is a very high-cost area in the west coast of Vancouver Island.",
            "So we \u2013 again, I don\u2019t think we see any impact on our business going forward or it\u2019ll be minimal. I would like to highlight the use of LiDAR technology, the investment we made a few years ago. It has certainly reduced the expected declines we would have expected to see due to natural decline of AAC over time, because the investments identifying that forests are growing faster and has improved and enhanced our understanding of the standings timber inventory.",
            "So, I think it sounds like a bad news story. It\u2019s actually not \u2013 it should not impact our mill operating platform going forward. And it\u2019s actually a good news story from a LiDAR perspective and our investments, because we actually have a much better understanding of our inventories and our growth rates, and that improves our ability to sustainably manage our tenures."

         "Remarks": [
            "Hi, good morning. Dan, we\u2019ve seen some really good volume growth numbers from quite a few of the wood pressure traders and composite decking producers. Do you think cedar has lost market share this year?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Hamir Patel"
      },
      "12": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, I don\u2019t think so. Not for us, Hamir. I mean, but you have to put everything in perspective when you\u2019re thinking of our business. In our business, we got off to a, what I would call, a standing start, which is difficult in the lumber business coming into second quarter we \u2013 due to the long Strike.",
            "And so we\u2019re pretty pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made and particularly in the product lines you\u2019ve identified and particularly in the home centers. We\u2019ve made investments in our products and branding that has been really well received there. And we\u2019re expecting to see a benefit from that going forward.",
            "So I don\u2019t think cedar is losing any traction. I think, we\u2019re also very encouraged on the cedar front that as the investments people are making in their homes have increased, especially in the current COVID environment, we\u2019re expecting to see cedar demand increase through the traditionally slower third quarter.",
            "So maybe to conclude, obviously, I think the best products are natural products and those products, for us, are in appearance cedar and the application of those, I think, our treating segment is going very well.",
            "An example for us might be that our treating volumes this year, I\u2019d expect to approach what we\u2019re doing in 2018. And yet to put that in context, our volumes are lower. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re losing traction. And I think actually, the work we\u2019re doing on marketing is going to benefit us with increased demand for cedar going forward."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks, Don. That\u2019s helpful. And then with respect to how your products are priced through the home center channel, is that \u2013 should we think of it as a lag with some of those random lengths benchmarks and how long would that lag be?"

         "Speaker": "Hamir Patel"
      },
      "14": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, yes. So on the actual pricing that the home centers are putting to the final consumer, there may be some lag. We\u2019ve seen pretty strong pricing in Cedar over the last year or two. And I think, if you\u2019re comparing it to the immediate run-up in two by four, you would say, it would lag. But I think we\u2019re pretty pleased with the pricing momentum we\u2019ve seen in Cedar over the last couple of months here."

      "15": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Fair enough. And Don, I just wanted to ask you about the various BC coastal policy changes this year. If all of them are implemented as conceived, what would be the annual EBITDA impact for Western?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Hamir Patel"
      },
      "16": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I got to say that that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s going to be tough to estimate, based on the fact that we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to implement. Maybe try to help answer that question. Like I think I probably, along with most operators in British Columbia worry about the cumulative effects of these multiple policy changes that have been advanced by the government and the impact it\u2019s having on not just Western, not just the coast, but the industry\u2019s ability to support forest sector jobs in our province, especially I think during COVID.",
            "I think material to us, probably, Hamir, would be \u2013 with respect to the manufacturing lumber reg, maybe just give you a little overview. I mean, the proposed amendments are to require cedar, Red Cedar and Yellow Cedar to be fully manufactured to be exported. That means that to be fully manufactured, it can\u2019t be kiln-dried, planed resaw in a facility outside of BC.",
            "Again, just like many of the regulations, the policies still haven\u2019t been released and won\u2019t become effective till September 30. So we\u2019re operating in a bit of a vacuum here. But I can tell you, the regulations proposed today could have unintended consequences, as I said, to our customers. But also \u2013 and through their purchases, those are the guys that support the thousands of jobs in the communities in the BC coast.",
            "So I think we\u2019re all surprised by the potentially punitive nature of the proposed regulation on the coastal businesses. We continue to work with others in the industry to engage government to ensure they can achieve their goal without negatively impacting customers and employment.",
            "And I guess, one would have to ask the question, if the government is going to implement something like this, then when is the right time? And is it in the COVID-19 environment? But I think they\u2019re better positioned to answer that than I am. I think our view is that restricting the volume and products to customers is not a way to grow business in BC and impacting BC companies is not a way to support investment in BC.",
            "I think, again, for you, I think the question is, \u201cWell, how would this impact maybe our investment in Arlington?\u201d And I can say that as we\u2019ve always said, Arlington is going to be a key hub for distribution to our customers in the United States and very critical as we invest in marketing and efforts to increase our volume into the home center business.",
            "I think also maybe a brief update. We are currently trialing our first trials of Japanese cedar at Arlington, and we\u2019re pretty excited about that opportunity. And again, it fits with our marketing efforts and with the targeted segment being home centers. So we\u2019re looking forward to how that goes. We\u2019re also just started trialing U.S. produced cedar there.",
            "So, for us, I think, we worry about the impacts the policies might have on BC production, BC reputation, BC jobs, but we\u2019re not standing still. We\u2019re doing things, in our business, to supply our customers utilizing the assets we\u2019ve got."

And so we\u2019re really focused on debt right now. But that said, we continually review our capital allocation and we continue to review opportunities of acquisitions.",
            "Our focus continues to be in the Pacific Northwest in specialty manufacturing. And despite the challenges we\u2019ve had with the Strike and coming out of the Strike and now with COVID-19, we continue to see and investigate opportunities. We\u2019ll see where that goes. But again, I\u2019d like to reiterate our first priority here from a liquidity and capital allocation perspective is to reduce our debt and create flexibility, given the uncertain environment we\u2019re operating in."

Again, I think, just the COVID really clouds the visibility and the outlook. And so, again, I think we\u2019re just going to focus on debt reduction. We review the capital allocation quarterly. With our Board, we\u2019ll continue to do so. But I think some of it is done. At this point, focus will be on debt reduction."

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. So as \u2013 I think a great question. So we will see kind of some recovery in Q3. And as I indicated, seasonality-wise, we tend to have supply disruptions and lower harvest levels in typical Q3 then we tend to increase our helicopter harvesting. So you\u2019re absolutely going to expect to see increasing harvest costs just because of that. We did get a benefit of reducing what we call timber developed, which is \u2013 we\u2019ve made \u2013 we \u2013 at our company, we expense roads when they occur and then harvest a lot of the harvest later.",
            "So I think, it\u2019s like a 10% benefit to log harvest costs is what we experienced. We\u2019re going to continue to right-size the business though, Paul. And I think that\u2019s really important. We\u2019ll continue to operate on the basis of producing logs in line with our lumber production. And that may mitigate the impact on costs going forward."

It\u2019s got an ability to load containers. It\u2019s got an ability to load a lot of trucks. And we centralized all of our cedar production there, because most cedar customers are looking for a mixed \u2013 highly mixed shipments of various products for their inventory.",
            "So it\u2019s really important that we have a facility that can do that. In addition, it\u2019s got to be able to repackage for certain customers. And I think, along those lines, the home center business and small packs, barcoding and the like.",
            "So that\u2019s part of the business there. We also have a planer kilns and the like. And so what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re bringing in lumber from Arlington \u2013 from Japan and elsewhere in Japanese cedar. There is no ability to manufacture logs at Arlington. It\u2019s only lumber and lumber processing and it\u2019s only tied to expanding the product lines that we have for our selected customer base.",

Shipments coming in of certain product lines and the processing is going to start there at Arlington. I can also tell you that we have processing capacity at Fruit Valley, which is tied to Columbia Vista in Vancouver, Washington, and we\u2019ll be utilizing that facility as well to further process some of the Japanese cedar We haven\u2019t seen the results of it yet, but we\u2019re pretty excited about the opportunity and the customer base seems quite excited."

There\u2019s definitely a price point here where the Japanese cedar is, in some cases, more competitive than BC cedar. And those \u2013 that \u2013 those are the ways we\u2019ll differentiate. We will be calling it Japanese cedar and we will mark it under a different brand."

We engaged components of the industry in that report and creating that report. Those recommendations were made public. We have commented on that, but that is the only actual communications we\u2019ve had directly with the government, other than expressing our concerns about the potential impacts and the timing of this giving COVID."
