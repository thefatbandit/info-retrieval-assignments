         "Thank you Tim. Our results for the second quarter not only continue our trend of solid financial and operating performance, they also demonstrate that we are controlling what we can. And by doing so, we are well positioned to become a more profitable company.",
         "Last quarter we outlined the steps that we're taking to align our business with the current environment. Those steps include reducing our capital program, improving our cost structure, and reinforcing our balance sheet.",
         "Regarding our capital program. CapEx in the second quarter totaled $312 million, 44% lower than the first quarter this year. The step down in the quarter reflects less overall activity as well as continued improvement in well costs. For the second time this year, we are reducing our well cost guidance due to better operational efficiencies and a lower service cost environment. We expect the cost to drill, complete, and equip a well to average less than $800 per foot or more than 30% lower than the cost to do that work last year.",
         "With respect to our cost structure. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A, and interest expense totaled $7.49 per unit, down 20% from 2019. We are managing all aspects of our cost structure. Examples include the logical items, like well maintenance, workovers, water handling, and optimizing artificial lift. We also made the difficult decision to implement a voluntary separation program. These combined efforts are expected to result in more than $135 million in reduced operating and G&A costs, up from our prior target of $100 million.",
         "Quickly adjusting our capital program and managing our costs lower combined with our hedge position drove strong cash flow generation. Operating cash flow before working capital was $550 million, which resulted in $238 million of free cash flow, which brings me to reinforcing our balance sheet.",
         "Our cash position nearly doubled to $320 million; and at the end of the second quarter, our net debt was $3.6 billion, down from $4.3 billion a year ago despite commodity price volatility. And although we have one of the better balance sheets in the industry, we plan to direct the $375 million to $450 million of free cash flow anticipated in the back half of the year to our balance sheet, making quick progress towards our goal to reduce net debt by another $600 million.",
         "Oil volumes for the second quarter averaged 200,000 barrels per day, and we remain on track with our full year guide of approximately 197,000 barrels per day and $1.6 billion in capital spending. We've built a leading position in one of the best resource basins in the world. Our portfolio quality, depth, and durability are nearly unmatched.",
         "Importantly, we have a good mix of investment opportunities across federal, state, and private lands. This mix allows us to redirect capital without degrading the returns or the capital efficiency of our drilling program. And as Tim discussed, we are working to minimize our emissions as well.",
         "I'm confident that our operating principles and performance regardless of the environment we're in. Without question this has been a challenging year thus far testing every company. To meet the challenge, we're maintaining our approach to capital discipline and prioritizing free cash flow. I believe that our second quarter results show that the steps we are taking are enabling us to build a better company, driven by more efficient capital investment and cost control.",
         "With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."
      ],
      "Megan Hays": [
         "Thank you, and good morning everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. As a reminder, during today's conference call, we will provide forward-looking statements based on current expectations. I'll call your attention to the forward-looking statements and other disclaimers that are provided in the earnings release and presentation. Our comments today may also reference non-GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations for those metrics can be found in our earnings release. You can find the earnings release and presentation on the Investor Relations page of the Concho website.",
         "Joining me on the call today are Tim Leach, Concho's Chairman and CEO; along with President, Jack Harper; Chief Operating Officer, Will Giraud. Tim is going to begin followed by Jack, who will give you a review of our financial results and outlook. Following their prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.",
         "With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim."

      "Operator": [
         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2020 Concho Resources, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]",
         "I would now like to hand the conference over to Ms. Megan Hays, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Affairs. Ma'am, you may begin. "
      ],
      "Tim Leach": [
         "Thanks Megan. Good morning. The second quarter tested the strength of the industry, and I'm confident we're even stronger company after the recent challenges. Not many companies are going to come out of this stronger, but I believe that we're one of them.",
         "As I think about the first half of this year, we've made real progress on several priorities that will position us for the future: maximizing our cash flow by adjusting our spend rate, production and cost structure; increasing the strength of our balance sheet; continuing to return capital to shareholders through our dividend; and managing the oil price volatility with capital discipline, while also preserving our operational capacity.",
         "The last several months have been more volatile than anything we've ever seen. Oil ended the quarter up 92%, the largest move in the quarter in 30 years, but what a ride. Oil prices dropped to negative $38 then rebounded to positive $40 as the U.S. and OPEC+ cut production.",
         "Against a volatile backdrop and historically weak price realizations, Concho delivered strong operational and financial performance in the second quarter. Our results reflect the strength of our portfolio and our team. We delivered strong cash flows and lower cost while we cut our activity.",
         "Moving forward we're maintaining the same level of focus that helped us navigate the first half of the year. In short, we'll continue to remain flexible. And as we look past 2020, we will be patient for sustained higher prices before increasing spending.",
         "Today there are 125 rigs running in the Permian. A year ago there were 440, and frac spreads have declined even more dramatically. This reduction in activity is starting to show up as declining Permian production. In addition, fuel declines are setting in, capital continues to be scarce, and we're seeing the effects of a shrinking industry. We believe the future of our industry requires better capitalized companies, more capital discipline, less leverage and being more aware of market signals for growth.",
         "Before the pandemic, we outlined a clear vision for the evolution of our business, delivering both sustainable cash flow growth, production growth, and increasing returns to shareholders. While there's more uncertainty than usual around the macroeconomic environment, this plan remains unchanged. And the principles that form our strategy, people, assets, returns, and financial strength will guide us along the way.",
         "Operating responsibly is key to the evolution of the business model as well. We believe that operating responsibly and delivering good financial performance are not mutually exclusive. Our flaring performance in 2020 is trending toward 1% of gross operated gas volumes as compared to 1.8% in 2019.",
         "In August, we'll publish our first sustainability report. We look forward to engaging with you on these important topics. We continue to work through the pandemic and the impact that it's having on our communities and workforce. I want to acknowledge the hard work of our employees. They continue to perform well in a tough environment. This was a great quarter, and I'm proud of our performance.",
         "Before I turn the call over to Jack, I want to summarize a few things that I hope you will come away with. First, we're successfully managing this cycle without losing focus on the long-term value and operational capacity of the company. Also, we're improving our operational performance, which is lowering our cost structure.",
         "Next, we're continuing to reduce our net debt. And finally, we will be patient on the recovery, prioritizing free cash flow and reinforcing our machine.",
         "With that, let me turn it over to Jack."

And we feel like this strikes that balance of maintaining a stable production base but also building a little bit of momentum as we start the budget season for 2021."

Yes, I think if you just kind of looked at the improvement, roughly half of it is related to efficiency gains and another half is kind of more just service cost pricing coming down. And I think there's probably still some work to be done on both of those sides. I think the team has done a really good job, continuing to improve cycle times. I think there's more work to do there as well. On the service cost side, it will depend on what activity levels look like here in the Permian in the back half of the year."

What are your thoughts and how philosophically would achieving that goal then impact subsequent actions? When you get to $3 billion, then what happens next? Is that where you would more quickly increase returns to shareholders? Would you just continue to have an even lower debt reduction goal? Would there be capital to allocate to production growth, which you said earlier with an longer-term -- a longer-term objective. Can you talk a little bit more about that?"

So, I think getting to that goal, getting to that goal quickly enables you to then look at all the other options on how to return capital to shareholders. So, I think that is the logical next step."

But I would tell you, I'm just -- the main message from this quarter is, I'm so happy that we have a viable strong business at this new pricing level. That's the main message. And that we can very quickly get by producing more free cash flow and running our business we can get this thing -- balance sheet position where we think it's appropriate for any scenario in the future, and that gives us all kind of optionality especially if we have a return to pricing like we've had in the past."

         "Remarks": [
            "Great. And then my last one is on well performance and really a little bit of a two-parter. The first is, can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing from the well performance to date, particularly as it relates to the spacing? And how some of those wells are performing, maybe not necessarily in their first 30 or 60 or 90 days but thereafter? And then also, can you talk about the base decline rate? And if there's anything beyond -- if there's anything you're doing to manage -- to best manage that?"

            "Sure. Brian, it's Will. On the performance side, I mean the quarterly production was right kind of in line with what we expected. The well performance I would characterize the same. If you're asking about kind of the latest batch of projects that are at a spacing density less than some of the tests we did in 2019, those -- it's worth noting they're still relatively early in their life, but they look in line with what we would expect, so that all feels pretty good.",
            "As it relates to the base decline, I'd still -- I think we would still talk about that low 40s for this first year decline, but finding a way to continue to moderate that. I do think that as we go at a slower pace, you will see that moderate maybe a little faster than we were expecting in previous conversations, but that's probably to come later."

With the activity you've outlined, would it be safe to assume you could exit the year about where you are now? And the reason I asked is that I seem to recall on your Q1 commentary, the flattish profile for the balance of the year, that was your comments back then."

         "Remarks": [
            "Thanks, Derrick. Yes. If anything, since our last call and our last conversation, my confidence has increased in our business. And as for the second half oil production, I do still expect for it to stabilize in that 190 to 200 a day range. But we left our annual guidance unchanged for a couple of reasons. First off, mid-90s on oil in the back half of the year, only positively impacts that annual number by about 1%. And additionally, exit-to-exit rate basis, we see our production holding up well and better than most. And secondly, we described in the last quarter, our focus on free cash flow generation. And our improved cost structure, along with a stable production base have us ahead of plan in that regard. And then lastly, I guess I'd say the style and cadence of our program in the back half of the year will allow us to enter next year with maximum flexibility, a stable production base, and a strong financial position. I think many of our peers will struggle to achieve that."

         "Remarks": [
            "Great. And then perhaps for you, Will, on the follow-up question. And I'd like to really circle back to the topic that I raised last quarter and frame it slightly differently, that is, what a lower for longer price environment where the investor asked is flattish growth and return of capital. Would that environment change your view on optimal spacing? And I acknowledge in asking this question that you're spacing is conservative relative to industry based on the operational adjustments you made in the second half of last year. But is there an opportunity to get greater returns with wider spacing?"

      "27": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. I mean, we've definitely moved to a wider spacing here in 2020. I don't necessarily think that you'd see us adjust to something wider than that, if that's kind of what you're asking, if I'm understanding the question right. I do think given the volatility we see in the commodity and a whole host of other factors, including willing to run a relatively steady program, I think we're very comfortable with the cadence of our business right now and also the spacing patterns and targets we're going after."

         "Remarks": [
            "Sure, Arun, it's Will. Yes, the drivers on the CapEx improvement so far, as Jack mentioned was a couple of things. It was activity obviously slowing down over the course of the year, but then also pretty impressive improvement in just our cost structure on the drill of completing the quip side. As it relates to the back half of the year, there's a couple of things happening there. First, our activity in the second half has a little bit more activity on higher working interest properties, including 5 rigs that are currently on the Mabee Ranch, where we've got 100% working interest. Second, we saw a very low amount of non-operated capital in 2Q. And so I think our expectation is, we'll still see that non-op activity come to see us in the back half of the year. And so that was kind of another toggle on the capital."

I mean, I think you guys have publicly talked about something now and, call it, in the $1.4 billion range. Please just stop me if I'm incorrect with that view and just thoughts on how that could translate in terms of 2021 sustaining CapEx?"

I think this quarter shows that really what we're focused on right now is controlling the things we can control and grinding on costs, whether they are capital costs or lease expense costs or G&A cost. And so we're going to keep working on that number. But for now, I think that's a good number to have."

If we look at the current Street median numbers for oil in Bloomberg, they are 195 for 3Q, 191 for 4Q, which would average just under 199.

Maybe another slight follow-up on that maintenance capital question, the 8 rigs and 2 frac crews you all are running in the second half of the year, is that generally a good level to think about that's maintenance CapEx or to be at your maintenance production levels? Would you need to add a little bit more on the rig or frac side?"

We tried to talk more in terms of capital than activity, just because, as I mentioned, there can be a little bit of noise as we bounce around between different working interests in different projects.

I think individual deals are just that, they are individual deals if they are all different. So I don't think you can characterize consolidation by any one deal or perhaps the last deal that just happened. But I do think the industry, in general, is going to have to get more efficient. And to get more efficient than these companies and the industries going to have to be better capitalized and be able to run at lower cost with less debt. And so I think we'll see that happen. I'm not sure how that affects Concho. Concho is really well positioned with the property base we have and where we're located. I think we can continue to do what we do for a very long time. So I think our number one mission right now is just to continue to create a more efficient company with what we've got."

So all your comments Tim have been pressing and great to hear you reiterate all this morning. My question is this, if and when oil prices do recover, how do you think about a planning process going forward? I mean, obviously, some level of growth versus the broader market is probably desirable just not 20%, 25%, 30% where the industry was. So how do you think about that reinvestment rate? Is there a cap on your spending? Is there a cap on your growth rate? I know you're not there yet, because you've survived the second quarter more than survived the second quarter, but just philosophically when you think about the long-term, what are the parameters that are feeding into your thought process about what you want to offer to the market?"

Well that's not how it's going to work in the future. And so I think philosophically staying focused on the efficiency of the business, driving down cost, what does it cost to add a barrel of production, what are your returns those types of things, I think it's probably going to be measured in percentages of your total cash flow that are reinvested into the business and reducing those percentages over time to be able to show continued growth.",

So as we entered this cycle, no one really thought that U.S. shales could grow as much as they did add as much production and that threw everything out of balance at a really bad time. And so I think as consolidation takes place and the major producers get their shops in order, I think everybody is going to have to be more aware of supply and demand fundamentals in the world. And yes, I think what you're talking about is lower growth required bigger cash flow distributions, less percentage of your total cash flow reinvested into the business more efficient machines."

The benefits to us are on both the capital side and that this entity will be spending capital dollars to build out water infrastructure as opposed to ourselves. It will also help on the lease operating expense side and help us continue to drive down to the extent we're trucking any water. This will get -- should get all of our water on the pipe over time.",
            "And then one of the longer term, but it's still a very important goal is to increase our percentage of recycled water use. And our opinion is that you're going to need to have big third-party infrastructure to handle big bonds of water and move it around the basin where it's needed as opposed to the older model where individual companies built it themselves and utilized it at pretty low rates.",
            "And so those are the drivers for it. I think an important also piece of it is that the existing equity owners agreed to increase their capital commitment to the entity. So I think it sits in a very good position and helps take the burden off of us from a capital standpoint."

So a fair amount of that was already baked into getting to where we are today. We do expect to see incremental benefit, but it will probably be modest from where we are with that transaction.",

It's kind of the whole program, short laterals, long laterals, et cetera. And so I do think we'll continue to trend that down over the course of the year and into next year, but time will tell in terms of where that goes. And I think it will also be driven by what's happening from an activity level in the Permian in the back half of this year."

But I think as Tim and really all of us have alluded to here on the reinvestment it's -- we need to be more mindful of all the things going on in the world and the signals that we're getting.

A lot of my questions have been asked already, but one topic that I guess hasn't been addressed is the cost -- the LOE this quarter was quite low sequentially. I think you've deferred some workovers and maintenance activity. How should we think about LOE? I think your guidance for the rest of the year bakes that in but how should we think about it long term? Is the $4.50 or so number for LOE an achievable target in 2021? Or should we stick with somewhere between $5 to $5.50. "

And if you try and look and see what drove that pretty dramatic improvement it's a combination of things including just kind of process improvement some of these things we're doing around water, around power generation and getting off of generators and ESPs and other things we're doing on artificial lift. So those gains should be sustainable and that's probably about half of the improvement.",
