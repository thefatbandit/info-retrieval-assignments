         "Many thanks, Richard. And indeed, through the following slides, I will take you through the main points of financial transactions. And then we\u2019ll probably add some more comments on the P&L and the cash flow for the group.",
         "So in Slide 10 \u2013 so I suggest you turn to Slide 10, and you probably know this slide already very well. It summarizes our key transaction principle. So first, we will have new money, cash injections of \u20ac420 million under a debt that format to fund the company\u2019s operational needs. So that\u2019s one of the first very important steps we undertook in this financial transformation. This \u20ac400 million are fully underwritten by a group of lenders under the existing Term Loan B and RCF creditors. And also \u20ac20 million is provided by Bpifrance Participations. The maturity of this new financing will be June 2024. We also have received the first tranche of this \u20ac420 million, circa around \u20ac240 million 10 days ago. It has been already used to refund the $110 million bridge facility that was due at the end of July.",
         "Following this, we will receive the second parts, leading us to the \u20ac420 million tranche, \u20ac180 million later in August. Past these new money operations, there is also, as you know, a debt-to-equity swap operation of a large magnitude being implemented. It will encompass \u20ac660 million of debt reduction. First, we will have \u20ac330 million rights issue backstopped by TLB and RCF creditors with commitments by Bpifrance Participations to participate prorata its current shareholding. And at the same time, we had also another second rights issue of \u20ac330 million of reserved capital increase to TLB and RCF creditors. These operations will be launched at the beginning of August, August 4 to be specific. And we then meet September, September 11. Finally, we have extended \u2013 so third leg. Finally, we have extended the maturity of our debt, so \u2013 to December 2024, for the reinstated TLB and RCF debt of \u20ac572 million and it will be in reoccurring payments. We also extended the maturity to December 2023 of $125 million line we have \u2013 facility we have with Wells Fargo.",
         "If we now move to Slide 11, we are presenting here the key terms of the capital increase. I won\u2019t take you through all the details, but try to quickly summarize this. So first, you see there are two blocks in the slide. So the first block concerns a rights issue with shareholders\u2019 preferential rights with a total amount of \u20ac330 million. The pricing is been set at \u20ac2.98 per share, and the full amount is fully backed up by the TLB and RCF lenders. Bpifrance Participations will subscribe to the rights issue in cash pro rata its current shareholding, it is circa is around 7.5%. Any cash proceeds of the rights issue will be used in full to repay the TLB and RCF lenders at par value.",
         "In the second part of the slide, at the bottom, you have the details concerning the reserve capital increase. It has a total of \u20ac330 million, a subscription price of \u20ac3.58 per share. It\u2019s 20% more than for the first tranche. It is reserved to the TLB and RCF lenders and will be fully subscribed by way of set-off against their debt at par under the credit facilities. Moreover, it\u2019s also important to notice that 3 warrants will be allocated to existing shareholders at the time of the launch of the rights issue. These warrants will have a 4-year maturity and a strike price equal to the reserved capital increase price by \u20ac3.58 per share. They will give access to 5% of the share count of the company on a fully diluted basis, and we provide opportunity to existing shareholders to participate in the recovery of the company.",
         "If we now move to the Slide 12, this slide presents the calendar of the next steps, with the opening of the subscription period starting on August 4 and finishing September 11. What is \u2013 I will let you go through the details here, but what is really impressive in this table are the previous milestones that we have successfully passed in such a short period of time. And I would like here, again, to thank all advisers and also the group of lenders and their advisers that are accompanying the company through this journey. And have been tremendously helpful for us to accomplish this in such a short period of time. It\u2019s been a real successful collective effort.",
         "Slide 13. In this slide, you will find the outlook for this year and for 2022. So first, two primary warnings, so as you know, the trading environment remains highly uncertain. COVID-19 induced business disruptions are still affecting production services activities, in particular, in North America and India. So this outlook provided here relies solely on the currently available market forecast and remains, of course, subject to changes in case of further evolution of the pandemic.",
         "The second important warning is that also the financial restructuring undergone by Technicolor, and the very significant strengthening of its financial capabilities, as a consequence, still remain to be fully understood by all the stakeholders. So this should improve following the successful conclusion of the SFA process, which closed on July 28. But at present, this outlook does not take into account any improvements coming from the successful financial restructuring. Conversely, it does include some of the negatives associated with the entry into such a process.",
         "So after a strong first quarter and the second quarter demonstrating a better-than-expected resilience, Technicolor expects, as it\u2019s mentioned on this slide, to hit an adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac169 million and adjusted EBITA of a negative \u20ac64 million in 2020. It also expects to deliver an EBITDA of \u20ac425 million and an adjusted EBITA of around \u20ac202 million in 2022. One point of importance is that it should be noted that more than \u20ac15 million of COVID-19 related costs are included in the group\u2019s EBITDA guidance we provide you with for 2020.",
         "Continuing free cash flow, so the third part of our guidance, is anticipated to be at the end of this year, in a range in between a negative \u20ac115 million and a negative \u20ac150 million. Following the entry into the SFA procedure, the faster-than-expected shortening of payment terms was requested by suppliers, leading to early payments as early as 2020 versus the following year. So this should impact 2020 and 2021, but we already know that mitigating factors will have 2021 to remain on the target we fix ourselves and to absorb some of the potential negatives we have here. The positive side of these changes is that the group\u2019s ambition to very significantly reduce payment terms by 2022 will be achieved probably as early as beginning of 2021. These are simply timing adjustments. Of course, the group\u2019s liquidity needs remain overall unchanged. Finally, this guidance is aligned with the scenario and strategy plans we shared with our lenders and disclosed in our June 22 press release. It focuses on EBITDA, EBITA and free cash flow rather than on revenue evolutions, and these are really the best performance indicators for Technicolor.",
         "Let\u2019s move now to Slide 15. So in the following slides, I\u2019m going to give you some more color and try to complement the picture that Richard has given you for the first half. So what I suggest is that we start here again at the level of the EBITDA. So overall, in first half of 2020, the adjusted EBITDA is reported at \u2013 EBITA, sorry, is reported at minus \u20ac65 million. It is up \u20ac22 million versus last year. The sharp reduction of EBITDA versus last year, and it was \u20ac51 million, has been, as you can see, partially absorbed by lower D&A, in particular, in Production Services and in the DVD division. If we go down one with a few lines, nonrecurring items amounts to negative \u20ac106 million for this year. It\u2019s mainly composed of a goodwill impairment charge, non-cash, of negative \u20ac68 million taken on DVD goodwill and an increase around \u20ac30 million of restructuring charges linked to our transformation plan. And again, for the record, COVID-related expenses are all accounted for in EBITDA. The EBIT, therefore, settles at negative \u20ac195 million and the group net results are \u20ac265 million.",
         "So let\u2019s move now down to Slide 16. Here, you will find an adjusted EBITDA average comparing H1 2019 to H1 2020. The business performance of a negative \u20ac51 million is impacted by \u2013 mainly by the decline of Production Services, negative \u20ac78 million, leading to sales decrease around Film & Episodic, and by DVD Services reduction of \u20ac8 million, mainly due to lower volumes. This is partially mitigated by Connected Home, increased \u20ac30 million of EBITDA, delivering a very strong year. Margin improvements and cost savings plans are more than offsetting lower revenues in relation to EMEA and LATAM activities. Again, Connected Home is in the path of driving a very strong year. I think it should be emphasized. Corporate and Others is also improving by \u20ac5 million, mostly helped by revenues coming from the product licensing, retained contracts and cost cutting.",
         "Slide 17. We have already commented the sales and EBITDA variance for Production Services, So maybe a quick word on the adjusted EBITA variance of \u20ac70 million. It is reflecting the variance at the EBITDA level of \u20ac78 million, and that\u2019s partially offset by lower D&A, and it\u2019s linked to better manage and lower rendering costs.",
         "Slide 18, same slide than for Production Services, but this time, we are discussing DVD. Adjusted EBITDA at a negative \u20ac29 million has improved since last year by \u20ac3 million. The negative \u2013 clearly, the negative minus \u20ac8 million of EBITDA variance is more than offset by lower D&A. And these are driven by production capacity optimization on one hand. And also, as we have mentioned that in the past, the positive impact of the new contract structure that are kicking in, such as \u20ac120 million negative cost of variance of \u20ac79 million versus last year. And this is mainly driven by the goodwill impairment charge I just talked about of \u20ac68 million. Following COVID-19 revised assumptions, that\u2019s not the main item. And more importantly, higher work used for the calculations, higher work reflecting \u2013 no, the discount rates, reflecting basically our new cost of debt.",
         "Slide 19, Connected Home. So EBITDA is this year. And again, I think it should be noticed positive, that\u2019s \u20ac20 million, strong results in a difficult year. It illustrates beyond the strength of its division, the successful turnaround started 2 years ago and its further acceleration recently. The plus \u20ac38 million variance versus last year, is related to EBITDA improvement and lower tangible depreciation in royalties, reserves. The nonrecurring EBIT of minus \u20ac10 million is mainly related to new \u2013 the impact of new restructuring plans.",
         "Slide 20. We are now focusing on the bridge from adjusted to EBITDA and EBIT. The various items to consider here, the PV amortization of a negative \u20ac22 million has improved by \u20ac6 million due to lower our R&D PP amortization on Connected Home. We are talking here mainly about R&D amortizations. The impairments and write-off of a negative \u20ac72 million is related to HES impairment charges on goodwill for \u20ac68 million. The restructuring charges of \u20ac41 million negative are higher than last year by \u20ac30 million, and it relates to additional restructuring charges to the Panorama cost saving plan in all PDs. To be noted, the pace at which the Panorama plans are being deployed, have accelerated, as Richard has mentioned it, and we are very much on track to deliver them quicker, faster than expected. The other non-current positive impact of \u20ac8 million is mainly explained by some small items. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to dwell too much on it.",
         "In Slide 21, we are now looking at the bridge between EBIT and net reserves. So, net interest charges at \u20ac40 million have increased by \u20ac7 million. This is mainly due to the cost of our usage of the bridge loan, and the cost of us drawing more on our credit lines through the first half of the year. Other financial items at negative \u20ac28 million have increased by \u20ac12 million, and this is mainly due \u2013 mainly linked to refinancing fees charges, mitigated by some better foreign exchange results. As a result, our net result continuing is posted at a negative \u20ac264 million, a decrease of \u20ac121 million versus last year.",
         "On Slide 22, we can see on this side, the bridge on the free cash flow from last year to this year. So going from left to right, we have already explained the \u20ac51 million related to EBITDA. So we pass on this one. You can see that the CapEx expense has decreased by \u20ac34 million, and it\u2019s mainly linked to stricter control on CapEx, even reinforced this year, and the impact of the structure of the new contracts at DVD. Working cap it\u2019s variance of \u20ac50 million negative is driven by lower cash in \u2013 following the lower sales in all divisions. Conditions of payments \u2013 terms with suppliers have also been made more complex by the SFA process.",
         "In Slide 23, here we are seeing a little bit more in detail the evolution of the net nominal debt and the cash on the other hand. So on the top of the slide we look at the gross nominal debt. At the end of June, it was \u20ac1.6 billion. The debt increased by \u20ac368 million during the semester. The cash at the end of June was at \u20ac63 million, \u20ac2 million lower than in December 2019. This decrease is explained mainly by the free cash flow, continuing decrease of \u20ac286 million, the new cash from debt of plus \u20ac353 million, mostly related to credit line drawings to a token of \u20ac395 million. The other items, negative \u20ac61 million are mainly cash collateral and security deposits requested and driven by a weak and pre-SFA financial position. It also incorporates some refinancing fees to a token of around \u20ac20 million. So this concludes my presentation.",
         "And the following slides provide some more details around the debt structure, but I will probably stop here and leave back the floor to Richard."

      ],
      "Richard Moat": [
         "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Richard Moat, the CEO. It\u2019s a great pleasure to speak to you once again on the occasion of the announcement of our first half 2020 results. First of all, I hope you and your families are safe and secure. Obviously, in a very troubled world, that\u2019s a major priority.",
         "Maybe I should start on Slide 4. So during the last few weeks, we\u2019ve been working very hard, and I wanted to remind you a few of the key milestones which have been achieved. On July 5, our safeguard plan was approved by the majority of 100% of the voting creditors. On July 20, all the resolutions were approved at the shareholders\u2019 meeting. These resolutions were key to giving the company the necessary tools to implement its financial restructuring. On July 28, we got the approval of the accelerated financial safeguard by the Paris Commercial Court. Today, Technicolor is now on track to deliver its financial restructuring plan, providing a framework for long-term sustainability for the company\u2019s businesses, employees, customers and suppliers, and this is a really great achievement.",
         "As part of this new framework, we\u2019ve already received the first tranche of around \u20ac240 million of the new money. This will be used to reimburse our $110 million bridge facility, which was due tomorrow, the end of July, and to continue to run our daily operations. During all this time, we continue to run our businesses as usual, with no impact on our operations or the quality of service, which we deliver to our clients, whilst maintaining our workforce of talented people to enable the delivery of all of our services and products. And I want to thank all of our teams who remain dedicated and committed throughout this period to serving our customers. Technicolor\u2019s leadership positions and customer loyalty are valuable assets. We have a great story to build for the future, and we\u2019re all very enthusiastic about carrying it forward.",
         "So if we turn to Slide 5, let\u2019s take a look at our first half figures. After a strong first quarter, the group\u2019s activities have demonstrated resilience to the COVID-19 crisis in the second quarter. Consolidated revenues for the group were down 19% at current rates to \u20ac1.433 billion, as the impact of COVID-19 on Production Services and DVD Services was partially compensated by outperformance in broadband, particularly in North America, where we saw 15% growth compared to the first half of 2019.",
         "Our adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac53 million, down 49% at constant rates, was impacted by lower business volumes in Film & Episodic Visual Effects and in DVD Services related to the COVID-19 business interruption. But this was partially compensated by operational and financial improvements across all our divisions. And that was particularly visible in Connected Home, where EBITDA grew 126% compared to the first half of 2019.",
         "We continued our strong focus on the delivery of previously announced cost savings through our Panorama plans, and we are well on track to achieve total savings in the year of in excess of \u20ac160 million. To date, \u20ac67 million of cost savings have been achieved and we are highly confident of achieving the remainder. Our adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac67 million \u2013 minus \u20ac67 million was mitigated by lower depreciation and amortization and reserves. And our free cash flow of minus \u20ac286 million was just slightly lower than last year.",
         "Now, turning to Slide 6, in Production Services, revenues were down 35%, driven by the previously anticipated delays in awards coming from one key client but mainly by the subsequent pandemic-related impacts on production around the world. Film & Episodic VFX, together with post production, took a major hit as all live-action film shoots were suspended. Advertising activity weakened due to major advertisers delaying campaigns and reducing marketing budgets during the sanitary crisis. Animation & Games activity, on the other hand, had a strong top line performance despite the temporary shutdown of our Bangalore studios. Adjusted EBITDA was close to breakeven, mainly driven by Film & Episodic VFX. During the entire first half, we continued to deliver highly valuable projects for our customers, such as Cruella for Disney, Ghostbusters: Afterlife for Sony, Godzilla vs. Kong for Warner Bros/Legendary, Top Gun: Maverick for Paramount and West Side Story.",
         "On Slide 7, in DVD Services, revenues were down 20%, with replication volumes down 27% year-on-year. Activity was strongly impacted by the limited number of new releases due to COVID-19 but back catalog volumes were considerably higher than anticipated. Adjusted EBITDA was at breakeven, broadly in line with expectations given the anticipated volume reduction and normal seasonal weakness, which we get in the first half. The margin was bolstered by ongoing cost savings and a positive impact from contracts which we renegotiated in 2019. The specific timing and extent of the reopening of movie theaters will impact the level of new release activity on disk. DVD has accelerated its future restructuring plans in an effort to adapt to those impacts.",
         "On Slide 8, Connected Home revenues were down 12.3% year-on-year at constant rate. The division is maintaining its market leadership in the broadband segment and in the video Android-based segment. Both segments are expected to continue to gain importance in the foreseeable future. Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled versus last year as a result of the transformation plan we launched 2 years ago. The division continues to focus on selective investments in key customers and specific parts of the portfolio that will lead to improved margins over the year.",
         "I will now hand over to Laurent, who will detail our financial restructuring plan and comment on our first half financial performance.",
         "Thanks very much, Laurent. So to conclude, we are entering a new era in our history. Technicolor has solid business foundations and strong capabilities in terms of people and assets. Our company plays a vital role in a number of markets and provides truly differentiated products and services to our clients. We have the right business focus and operational design, and now we will have the appropriate capital structure to support it. Technicolor intends to return to delivering profitable growth, cash generation and value creation for shareholders. So many thanks for your attention. And now with Laurent, we are ready to take your questions."

            "Good afternoon. Can I just \u2013 when you are talking about the suppliers getting more touchy about the payment terms, how long would you expect it to take for that to correct when they get the message through that the company is on a much sounder financial sorting?"

         "Remarks": [
            "I think that\u2019s a very difficult question to answer. When the \u2013 when we went into accelerated financial safeguard and also Chapter 15 in the U.S., this caused a lot of consternation amongst our major connected home suppliers. And they initially were looking for significant reductions in payment terms from where we stood, which was around about 105 days. We managed to persuade them that the process was going well and that we had high confidence that it was going to succeed. And as a result of that, we have landed on a new agreed set of payment terms, which we believe that we can live with going out into the future. It was always our intention to reduce payment terms between now and the end of 2022, but we didn\u2019t realize that we are going to have to do it quite as quickly as this because basically, we have got to stop to do it from the fourth quarter onwards. So I think that \u2013 obviously, we need to demonstrate that we have exited successfully from the process. I think we need to complete the process because the sort of slew of press releases, which we keep pushing out, although each one is intended to be positive. Nevertheless, I think, creates further confusion and doubt. So when we have completed the capital increase and the rights issue and the reserve capital increase, I think at that point, we can then hopefully get on to a more even keel and start to rebuild confidence. And I think there will, however, be \u2013 the ways in which we can start to improve our situation with the suppliers on a practical level. For example, we hope that we and they can get access to insurance, again, on our receivables, which is during the period that we have been in SFAs has been basically impossible. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you would like to add to that, Laurent?"

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, I think you summarized it well. So we had, if you remember, for those who are attending our Capital Market Day, we had already explained at the time that we were basically preparing ourself, preparing the company for a reduction of payment terms down to, let\u2019s say, normal trends. We are planning the end in 2022. With the numbers we have today, we know we are going to \u2013 and the discussions we have with the suppliers, who will be there already as early as 2021, point one. Point two, do we believe we could cite further? The answer is no. To the contrary, as we are exiting from SFA, and then hopefully, we are willing to regain, at some point, a coverage with insurance, we on \u2013 to the contrary, we think that will reassure our suppliers, and we will stay there. Point three, because it\u2019s of importance. As all of these have been, to a certain degree, anticipated, the amount of liquidity that is very considerable that we have raised and, I should say, the fact that since the start of the year, we are performing better, including during Q2 versus our own cash expectations, makes us believe that we can actually absorb this faster and to a degree, we are going to remove earlier the sort of attention we have on the World Cup in as early as 2021. And finally, as I have mentioned in my comments, although it has a slight \u2013 potentially a slight negative impact at the end of the year, and we might have ways to compensate for that. We believe that we already know how to deal with that in 2021. So we are trying to say, this is something we had to deal with. We are prepared. We are dealing with it. And at the end of the day, that\u2019s going to make it sounder \u2013 that makes it a sounder work cap than before."

Obviously, it has restarted in some places like New Zealand and Czech Republic and Iceland and a few other places, but not on the scale we need to redevelop our forward pipeline. So our assumption is still that it\u2019s going to take through to October before things start to happen."

The first one is, as a global basis \u2013 on a global basis, have you benefited from state subsidies such as partial and [indiscernible] packages, etcetera and if so, for which amount? My second question is related to Production Services. Have you reduced your employee base in line with your revenue decline and which percentage of your employees, are now working at home? And regarding the business, do you think that from H2 you could benefit from a catch-up effect from the studios? A question rapidly on Connecting Home, your performance in H1 was good. Do you expect to improve or maintain the profitability delivered in H1 in the second part of the year? Thank you."

            "Right, I will start with the first. I think Richard maybe will continue with the others. So yes, we \u2013 of course, we have a \u2013 as a company, is very conscious about its cash. We have pulled all the strings we could, and we did benefit at the end of June from \u2013 I mean, what \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call that state subsidies per se. So we really don\u2019 have \u2013 we don\u2019t benefit from APG or whatever, but what we have done \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s part of your question, but what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve used the legal framework that the sales put in place to postpone some payments. So although we haven\u2019t received any specific loan or whatever or any form, what we have done is we have moved some payments from first half to second half. The amount is \u20ac30 million. And in the guidance we gave you for the year, we anticipate a full repayment of these in \u2013 as early as H2, of course. So it has a neutral effect of free cash at the end of the year, but it has helped a little bit liquidity in the first \u2013 in June, but again, no direct state subsidies for us here."

            "So yes, we have reduced staff numbers in Production Services, in Film & Episodic and in Advertising and Post Production. Not so much in Animation & Games because we have managed to maintain a business there at pretty much the same level that it was before. In terms of people not working, we have got \u2013 overall across the group, we\u2019ve got about 80% of people enabled for home working. And that number is less than 100 mainly because of the fact that we can\u2019t get quite that high percentage in India because of broadband speed, which are available, but 80% across the group. With respect to \u2013 you asked about the half two catch up effects in studios, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any catch up effect. In my opinion, there\u2019s not going to be some sudden tsunami of work. It\u2019s going to pick up very slowly. And I think that is probably going to be into the middle of 2021 before we start to get back to any form of normality, but we are anticipating that there will be a gradual return to work from Q4 2020 onwards. And then on Connected Home, do you want to cover that, Laurent?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes. Yes. And then we will probably announce \u2013 I don\u2019t know if these questions are underlying of another one, but Connected Home has had a very strong performance in H1. Very strong, driven mainly by, but not only, by North American cable, driven by the \u2013 basically all the transformation that is taking place at a faster pace. Do we expect still a strong performance in H2? So today, I would say, yes. I come back on the numbers. But I would say, yes, at the moment, we have all clear indication of the fact that the demand is very strong and will continue. Now to maybe step back a little bit from your question, and make a comment on the overall guidance because you haven\u2019t asked me, but I think it is pretty underlying. At the end of H1, we are telling you that we are very good and probably ahead of our own expectations. That is correct. And we are providing you a guidance for the full year, that is let\u2019s say it seems to reflect the fact that maybe the second half could not be as strong as expected. It should be made very clear that we are very prudent with our guidance, why? This is related to the sort of warnings I gave you. Because of what happened in COVID, we don\u2019t know. So when we do our forecast, we project ourselves towards the end of the year and in particular, our Connected Home. We have good news at the moment that the business is doing very well. But still, we are, let\u2019s say, assuming or we are forecasting, we are putting in our models of something, kind of contingency, for eventually \u2013 an eventual second COVID wave impact in terms of supply shortage. Do we have any sign of this coming up? No. Do we have \u2013 but still this is the prudence we have here. We do the same in HES, and we do the same with Production Services. So we are prudent. As far as the second part of the year is concerned, the company is doing very well, but the environment is very tough. So in all numbers, we are reflecting that, and this is reflected in your guidance. "

            "Yes. I think that the demand in North America, we think, is going to remain strong. Comcast published their second quarter figures today. And you can see that they had the best ever second quarter in terms of high-speed Internet connections. And obviously, we are their major supplier. And so we anticipate that that kind of trend is going to continue. In the rest of the world, in Latin America, we have seen a big impact in the first half on demand from the fact that the Latin American currencies collapsed, driven by the significant fall in the oil price. And our products are dollar-denominated and so they went up significantly in price. So we have had to enter into negotiations with major customers about discounts and payment terms, kind of same thing we realized with our suppliers. And so therefore, demand was somewhat subdued. However, in the second half, we are starting to see it recover. But I wouldn\u2019t want to claim victory there yet, but we are starting to see recovery. There was obviously a very strong lockdown in Europe compared with North America, which presented truck rolls to install units in people\u2019s houses right across the continent. And that, again, has a dampening effect on demand. And obviously, the same thing is true across Asia and Japan and India. So we hope that as restrictions relax, demand will recover in those other territories. But at the moment, the key engine of growth remains North America. And despite the unfortunate development of the disease in North America, as we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks, demand still remains strong."
