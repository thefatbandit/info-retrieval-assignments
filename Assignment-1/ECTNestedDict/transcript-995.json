         "Thank you, Evan, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.",
         "The second quarter was certainly a difficult quarter, and I will begin my prepared remarks focusing on the financial results and the challenges we face due to the coronavirus pandemic, and then I\u2019ll turn the call back to Evan to provide more detailed information on Q2.",
         "For the second quarter of 2020, total revenue declined 18.3%. Expenses were down 8.2%, which resulted in a 72.4% decline in adjusted EBITDA. On our last call, we outlined a number of steps that have been taken to reduce expenses in the light of the current economic environment, including \u2013 which included layoffs, across the Board salary cuts and the elimination of the 401(k) match. Beginning in May, these steps resulted in a monthly expense savings of approximately $850,000.",
         "Let\u2019s take a look at the results by division to get a little better understanding of our performance. For the second quarter, broadcast revenue declined 19.6%. By month, broadcast revenue was down 24.5% in April, 24.7% in May, but only 8.7% in June, which of course indicates that business was starting to improve as the economy was beginning to reopen. However, with the recent increases in the COVID cases and further lockdowns, it\u2019s a little difficult to really know how that trend will play out.",
         "We might wait \u2013 Evan might give a little bit of pacing for July, but beyond that we really, we \u2013 it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess at this point. According to Miller Kaplan, in the markets where we operate, the industry was down 55.9%. Our strong outperformance relative to the industry shows the relative strength and resilience of Salem\u2019s business model. Historically, we have focused on paid national and local ministry programming, as well as direct advertisers. This revenue source is very stable, and many of these advertisers and programs have been with us for decades. Recently, we made investments in digital, including Salem Surround, a multimedia advertising agency with a focus on digital advertising.",
         "And we launched SalemNOW recently, an on-demand pay-per-view video streaming platform. Together, both of these have provided results that help \u2013 that helped us provide results that helped us outpace the industry in Q2. National Christian ministry block program revenue, which represents approximately 30% of broadcast revenue, was down less than 2%, providing an important foundation for our broadcast business. And we had another good quarter of growth in our local digital business primarily because of Salem Surround. Local digital was up 54% or $2 million. We\u2019re pleased with this growth, especially in these challenging times, and we\u2019re encouraged by the importance of both Salem Surround and SalemNow. Both are certainly contributing to our overall revenue mix. Local spot revenue was down 42.8% in the quarter, and national spot revenue was down 36.7%. These declines, of course, are related to the pullback in advertising revenue that the entire industry has experienced.",
         "Political revenue did not play a significant factor in the quarter. We recorded $600,000 in political revenue in the second quarter of this year and $400,000 in the second quarter of last year. Additionally, miscellaneous revenue declined 45.1%, principally due to the absence of live events. Most of the miscellaneous revenue is associated with live events of one kind or another. Broadcast expenses were down 12.2% due to lower commissions and, of course, the cost control measures that I mentioned earlier. Our revenue in our national digital division declined 5.2%. This decline is entirely related to our Christian websites, which experienced a 16.5% reduction in revenue due to lower advertiser demand and lower programmatic advertising rates,",
         "Revenue in Townhall media, our collection of conservative news and opinion websites, actually increased 19.2% due to the revenue from the Townhall VIP subscription product, which was launched in November of last year. Expenses in the digital division increased 0.1%, a minor increase due to the increased expenses associated with the rollout of Townhall VIP, much of which was offset by the previously mentioned expense savings.",
         "Finally, revenue from our publishing division was down 29.8%. This can be attributed to the fact that the majority of bookstores in the country were closed. And Amazon began making decisions to prioritize the shipment of essential products and delay the shipment of books. In terms of our self-publishing book sales, they were down as many authors chose not to buy books, which they typically buy from us on demand, as they could not promote their books at live events. So publishing expenses were down 3.6%, but certainly not enough to offset the decline in revenue.",
         "Additionally, corporate expenses were down 11.1%. And with that, Evan, I want to turn the call back to you for additional details on the quarter."

         "Joining me on the call today are Edward Atsinger, Chief Executive Officer; David Santrella, President of Broadcast Media and David Evans, President of Interactive and Publishing. We\u2019ll begin in just a moment with our prepared remarks. And once we are done, the conference call operator will come back on the line to instruct you on how to submit questions.",

In conformity with Regulation G, the information required to accompany the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.salemmedia.com.",
         "And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Edward Atsinger. Ed?",
         "Great. Thank you, Ed.",
         "For the second quarter, total revenue decreased 18.3% to $52.9 million. Operating expenses, on a recurring basis, decreased 8.2% to $50.1 million, which resulted in a 72.4% decrease in adjusted EBITDA to $2.8 million. Net broadcast revenue decreased 19.6% to $39.5 million and broadcast operating expenses decreased 12.2% to $33.1 million resulting in station operating income of $6.4 million, a decline of 43.9%.",
         "On a same-station basis, net broadcast revenue decreased 17.4% to $38.7 million, and SOI decreased 43.9% to $6.5 million. These same-station results include broadcast revenue from 95 of our 99 radio stations in our network operations and represents 98% of our net broadcast revenue.",
         "I will briefly review revenue performance of our strategic formats. 37 of our radio stations are programmed in our foundational Christian teaching and talk format. These stations contributed 42% of total broadcast revenue and decreased 14.4% for the quarter. Our 32 news talk stations had a decrease of 19.7% in revenue for the quarter. And overall, these stations contributed 17% of total broadcast revenue. Revenue from our 12 contemporary Christian music stations contributed 13% of total broadcast revenue and decreased 47.8% for the quarter.",
         "Our network revenue decreased 14.7% for the quarter and represents 11% of total broadcast revenue. Revenue from our national digital media businesses decreased 5.2% to $9.4 million and represent 18% of total revenue. Our publishing revenue decreased 29.8% to $4.0 million and represents 7% of our total revenue.",
         "As of June 30, we had $216.3 million in bonds outstanding and $19 million drawn on the revolver. We also had $19 million in cash. Our leverage ratio was 8.96%. As Ed mentioned, due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment due to COVID-19, we will not be providing guidance for the third quarter. But while we\u2019re still closing the books for July, I can tell you where total revenue looks like it will be. It should be down around 2%. Broadcast revenue in total was essentially flat and even up a little bit on a same-station basis. Local spot advertising was down 19% and national spot advertising was down 9%. Local programs were down 22%, while national programs were down 2%. Local digital revenue was up 132%. Our broadcast division was also aided by strong sales at SalemNOW. Revenue in our national digital division increased 2% and publishing revenue declined 28%.",
         "And this concludes our prepared remarks, and we would now like to answer any questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate that. Operator?"

            "A couple of questions here. First of all, the revenues were a little bit better than expected. And I know that it\u2019s been a sacrifice on all of you guys in terms of your employees going through this crisis and hats off to you guys to manage through that crisis. And hopefully, we\u2019re largely on the back end of this now. But I did have a couple of questions. Regarding your block programming, how are the ministries doing in this environment?",
            "Do you think that \u2013 I know that you have typically regular rate increases as you cycle into next year. Do you think that they\u2019re healthy? Are they doing okay? Or do you think that there might be some concessions as you need to go forward here with them? Just \u2013 kind of just a general outlook for that portion of the block programming."

         "Remarks": [
            "I can certainly take part of that. Ed, you might want to speak into it as well, Michael, but we check in with our ministries quite regularly. We have a great relationship with them, and so we\u2019re on the phone with them weekly. For the most part, most of the ministries are reporting a relative stable donor base during this time. And so none of them have kind of raised their hands and expressed some real concern.",
            "I think as we go into next year, we\u2019ll certainly need to be mindful of the environment that we\u2019re in, as we make decisions on what the proper rate increases will be for the coming year. We did that back in 2010. And we looked at things and decided to do a lower-than-normal ask on rate increase. And we\u2019ll look at that environment again as we go into 2021. But the relationships are strong, and so far, they seem to be relatively stable."

      "4": {
         "Remarks": [
            "And then in terms of the publishing side, certainly, that portion of the business, even though the revenues were a little bit better than I expected in the quarter, it still looks like that business has kind of suffered more than some of your other lines of business. Is it reflective of the fact that maybe some of these authors are not just not buying the books, but are they just delaying the titles at all?",
            "Is there any, just given the weak markets at this point, obviously, it\u2019s not the best environment to kind of launch your book. Just kind of give me some general trends in terms of the outlook for the number of titles that you anticipate in the back half, are they the same as you originally thought? Or you\u2019re kind of delaying some of these books?"
         ],
         "Speaker": "Mike Kupinski"
      },
      "5": {
         "Remarks": [
            "Well, there certainly have been books delayed. With many, many bookstores closed, with Amazon prioritizing essential shipments and not taking delivery of books, it was necessary to delay some releases. Even the books that were released, with our political titles, it\u2019s important to have publicity for those authors on news talk radio stations, news TV stations, and with COVID, all of the shows were 100% focused on the COVID crisis, and really weren\u2019t interested in talking with authors on books on other subjects. So it was kind of in Q2, it was kind of a perfect storm of no traction on any of our books.",
            "In terms of looking ahead to the rest of the year, frankly, it remains unclear what the rest of the year is going to look like. There are still many bookstores closed. Yes, I\u2019m certain that the election, it\u2019s going to get a lot of coverage. So election-related books have good prospects, but it nearly is very dependent upon what happens with COVID. So it\u2019s difficult to give you any feel for what the rest of the year is going to look like."

And of course, it\u2019s a kind of a weird environment where traffic to many sites were up anyway. Could you just kind of talk a little bit about the traffic trends in July, and how \u2013 now that the economies are starting to open up, are the traffic trends still being pretty strong? Or what \u2013 can you just kind of give us an outlook on how the traffic to your site is performing?"

         "Remarks": [
            "Yes, so traffic on the conservative sites is at record levels. People, they want to visit news websites, news opinion websites because they want to know what\u2019s going on with COVID from voices they trust. And then we\u2019ve got the election at the same time. So all of our concerns in opinion websites, the traffic is fantastic, and continues to be fantastic. That is offset, of course by the fact that programmatic advertising rates have dropped substantially at the same time. So it\u2019s not all good news.",
            "On the Christian side, the traffic is, it\u2019s closer to flat. It took a very nice bump up in April when the crisis first hit, but it has come back down to more normal levels and rates continue to be depressed."

We\u2019ve seen a little bit more political activity picking up both on the terrestrial broadcast side as well as even through our ad-injected streams."

            "Okay. Perfect. And I just had one final question. And this is kind of more of a macro thing, I know that Big Tech was before Congress, recently about any competitive practices. And I know that there are some other countries that have measures in place whereby many of these big tech companies have to pay for content and maybe be a little bit more competitive, I guess. And I know that in the past, David, you have indicated that the likes of Facebook had been largely anti-competitive, how they direct traffic and so forth. Are they \u2013 are you seeing a better environment as it relates to \u2013 because of their scrutiny? Or do you think that Congress is going to have to act? Or what are your thoughts in terms of just the competitiveness of the marketplace? Has it gotten better or worse?"

I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I think overall, the amount of traffic we\u2019re getting is looking changed."

Well, look, I think radio needs to be as competitive visually as some of our audio competitors are, the user experience on Spotify or for that matter, SiriusXM or Pandora, currently it includes album art, aired artist and title. And so I think on radio, our ability to provide a better user experience on the dashboard, the visual experience on the dashboard is important from a competitive perspective. And so certainly Quu or Q as they\u2019re called, offers that. But then on top of that, it offers the ability to interface more with our advertisers.",

And so we can reinforce the selling message that they\u2019re hearing on the radio and provide just better results for our clients. And so a better user experience, better results for our clients that we could also charge them more to receive, to me was a good idea and something that strategically from a long \u2013 for the long term, I think all radio\u2019s going to need to get there."

Certainly, one of the things that we disclose in our 10-Q, we have gone to a couple of our largest ministry clients and had some advanced payments from them, while offering them the small discount, in lieu of, or in exchange for getting payments early. So they paid their May through December airtime bill in the month of May. And we did that just to make sure we had ample liquidity for the June 1 interest payment. And you may have heard, we have right now \u2013 at the end of the quarter, we had $19 million in cash. I can tell as of today, we have $18.5 million in cash.
