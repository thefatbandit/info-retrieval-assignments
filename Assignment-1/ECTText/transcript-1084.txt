Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Joe Spak, I am the Lead Automobile Analyst here at RBC Capital Markets. It's my pleasure today to introduce the 2020 RBC Global Industrials conference. Keynote speaker, GM's CEO, Mary Barra. Under Mary's leadership, GM has really impressed us with the transformation of the business, their execution during difficult times, the focus on structurally improving free cash generation, and their transparency to the street. Further, we believe they have some of the leading technology including, Electric and Autonomous, that will help the company become a key player where the industry is going, and help them achieve their vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. The challenge has been getting the capital markets to appreciate some of the hard work that GM has been doing, which I'm sure we'll get into. So with that, I'm very pleased to welcome Mary, who has some opening comments. We'll then get into the Q&A, and I highly encourage investors to participate by asking a question in the question box on the webcast, which I can ask anonymously. So with that, Mary, thanks for joining us today. We really appreciate it.Well, thanks for inviting General Motors to participate today, Joe, and it's really a pleasure to speak with all of you. I'll begin with a very brief business update as the third quarter winds down, but I will spend most of my time focusing on our zero emissions future, which we are building right now through our EV program, which has been moving very fast, as some of you attended our EV Day in March. I'll conclude with additional details and a video featuring what it has already become, one of the most anticipated event in EVs [ph].  That and everything we will cover today will demonstrate why General Motors will win in electric vehicle, and how it will create profitable an all-electric future with a range of products that look great, charge fasting conveniently, and have the right combination of range, power and performance. I'll also talk more about our technology and our partnership developments in a few minutes. But let's turn to the business for a moment. While we carefully continue to monitor the coronavirus and its effect on public health and our operations, we are encouraged about the recovery we are seeing in most of our markets, including a strong U.S. industry SAR in August. Our full-sized and SUV plants are running all out and our other facilities are operating in line with market demand. We are selling every full-sized truck and SUV we can produce as demand remains strong and our inventories remain lean. In China, the industry continues its recovery and our JVs have been seen improved sales since the deepest impact of the virus in February. Our retail sales were up over 10% year-over-year in each of the past two months. This was led by an overall recovery in sales compared to earlier in the year, and versus a weaker Q3, 2019, and by sales of our all new or refreshed vehicles at Buick, Cadillac and Wuling. Our EV sales in China are also up significantly, led by the Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV. Last month, it was China's top selling EV just a month after its launch, and we've already taken more than 50,000 orders. That's a snapshot and we'll share our complete Q3 results on November 5. The global pandemic has had significant impact on our industry, our company and our communities this year. But hardship can bring much needed perspective and clarity to decision making. Very early in the outbreak, as the leadership team mobilized to protect the business and our stakeholders, we looked at every single program with very clear eyes, so we could preserve and even accelerate our work in EVs, AVs, software and connectivity solutions. With our industry and world up ended, we believe then, and we believe now that this is a defining moment for our company. We knew we needed to fully fund the programs that will drive our growth, help us realize our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion and create value for our shareholders. Even before the pandemic, we were very disciplined about driving efficiencies and reducing complexity across our business. We have taken necessary steps to reposition GM more favorably for the future, including exiting Europe, Australia, Thailand and other markets, restructuring Korea and preserving our overall manufacturing flexibility. We streamlined our product development organization, and we have combined propulsion and vehicle development with a strong focus on software, and we have thousands of engineers doing in-house software development. We've addressed our cost structure in North America and we are on track to realize the $4 billion to $4.5 billion of savings we've been targeting.  And we are continuing our transformational way of thinking and operating with a new Senior Vice President of Innovation and Growth, Alan Wexler, who joined us just a month ago. He will focus on identifying future growth opportunities and driving innovation throughout the company. He has a long track record of challenging the status quo to develop new strategies for business growth, and we're really excited to have him on the team. EVs represent the key growth segment for General Motors. We are going to win an EVs and give our customers an amazing ownership experience. We are allocating more than $20 billion in capital and engineering resources to our EV and AV programs from 2020 to 2025, leveraging our strong and profitable truck franchise. Our highly flexible global EV platform and state-of-the-art Ultium battery system will empower our next-gen EV portfolio. We believe strongly in our EV future and not just for vehicles, the strength and flexibility of our Ultium battery systems open doors for many use cases, including aerial mobility, which represents a natural next step in a zero emissions vision. Ultium isn't just a differentiator for General Motors, it is an industry leading platform technology that has significant market potential outside of General Motors, as our recent agreements with Nikola and Honda demonstrated. We will build on our long-term relationship with Honda and our new newly formed deal with Nikola, when other companies choose our platform and our battery technology, because it improves our scale which leads to lower costs, making it even more attractive for industry partners. Our goal is to bring more EVs to customers in more markets. It can be difficult to predict market trends, but we've conducted extensive research to understand what will motivate customers to choose an EV. As I said earlier, we know customers want EVs that look great, charge fast and conveniently and have the right combination of range, power and performance. That's why our platform is flexible to address the needs and desires of a wide variety of buyers. And that's why we're focusing on all aspects of the EV ecosystem. We are uniquely positioned to do this because of our industry leading modular EV platform and Ultium Battery System, our scale and manufacturing expertise and footprint, our joint ventures and partnerships that make the most of our owners capital, our strong brands and distribution network, and our leading position in China, the world's largest EV market. For those of you who are unable to attend our EV Day in March, let me briefly review what we covered and update you about what our teams have accomplished since then. During EV Day, we demonstrated our multi brand multi segment lineup of EVs, flexible battery architecture, infrastructure plans and meaningful sustainability commitments, and while no one else can match our combination of advanced technology, flexibility and scale. Of course, the heart of our EV strategy is our highly flexible global EV platform powered by our proprietary Ultium batteries. These batteries are unique in industry because they are large format, pouch-style cells that can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside the pack. Engineers can optimize battery energy storage and layout for each vehicle design. All of this means we can compete for nearly every customer in the market today, whether they are looking for affordable transportation, a luxury experience or trucks or a high performance vehicle. Our EV is on our path to achieve price parity with our gas powered vehicles. With our joint venture partner, LG Chem, we will develop and mass produce the cells for Ultium batteries, with the goal of reducing battery costs to industry leading levels below $100 per kilowatt hour, once we have the Lyriq and Hummer EV at full volumes, and then substantially lower over time. These cells will be built at our brand new joint venture manufacturing facility under construction in Lordstown, Ohio. We will have at least 20 EV models on the market by 2023, and by mid-decade we expect to sell a million EVs per year in our two largest markets in North America and with our joint venture partners in China. In fact, more than 40% of GM's new launches in China in the next five years will be electrified. As I mentioned, the team has aggressively moved forward since EV Day, and is making significant progress on new products and technology. We began introducing our Ultium powered EV models last month in the U.S. with the debut of the Cadillac Lyriq, dynamic, fully electric luxury crossover. It was well-received and positions Cadillac to be a leader in electrification, connectivity and automated driving. Next year, weâ€™ll launch the 2021 Chevrolet Bolt EV and the new Bolt EUV that uses our current battery electric system. The Bolt EUV will be the first Chevrolet equipped with Super Cruise hands free driver assist technology, and I'll touch more on that in a few minutes. On the technology front, we have developed a battery tech roadmap that includes, silicon anodes and lithium metal anodes, which improve energy density, vehicle range, affordability and reduce dependence on rare and costly metals. This goes beyond the 70% less cobalt in the current iteration of Ultium batteries compared to that of our current battery. For customers, this translates to future product plans that include premium vehicles offering 500 miles of range. We have a multipronged approach to defining our future, including collaboration through our joint venture and joint development agreements with LG Chem, fostering innovative startups including GM venture investments, university with our research partnerships and our own internal R&D. Last week we announced that GM will be the first automaker to use an almost completely wireless battery management system for production of electric vehicles. This wireless system will enable us to power many different types of electric vehicles from a common set of battery components. This improves speed to market because we don't have to develop specific communication systems or redesign complex wiring schemes for each new vehicle. With expanded over the air updates provided by our all new vehicle intelligent platform, the system can be reprogrammed over time with new software based features via smartphone like updates. In addition to technology progress, we've been very busy securing important alliances that will also accelerate our EV work. Earlier this month, we signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding with Honda to establish a North America Automotive Alliance. It includes a range of vehicles to be sold under each company's distinct brands, as well as cooperation and purchasing, research and development and connected services to maximize our combined resources and scale. And it builds on our agreement with Honda in April to jointly develop two all new electric vehicles based on our modular EV platform and Ultium battery system. We have a long history of successful collaboration including fuel cell technology development, and more recently, our partnership with Honda on EVs and AVs, including the Cruise origin, an electric and shared self-driving vehicle. We also share a similar vision of a better cleaner world, and that's what drives our plan to create synergies that will help make it happen sooner. Last week, we announced an agreement with Nikola to develop and manufacture its Badger pickup, using our battery electric truck platform and altering battery systems. It will also leverage our production ready Hydrotec fuel cell technology in the Badger fuel cell variant and its class seven and eight semi trucks. Hydrotec fuel cells are compliment to GMs Ultium batteries as part of our comprehensive electrification strategy. Hydrotec is a promising new aspect of our electrification technology, which can now be applied to growth markets that are outside of our traditional core businesses. Hydrotec fuel cells systems can deliver zero emission solutions to sectors of the economy that have high fuel consumption rates, and represent unsolved emission challenges for the incumbent technologies. We are excited to be the exclusive provider of Hydrotec Fuel Cell Technology to Nikola, everywhere outside of Europe, and I expect our recent announcement will be the first of many more opportunities for applications of our Hydrotec Technology and GM's growth into these new businesses. It's advantageous for GM to have third parties validate our electric vehicle and Hydrotec fuel cell technology. We are already pursuing additional collaborations that will accelerate EV adoption for both retail and commercial customers. Also last week, we announced that we're teaming up with Uber to help accelerate the rideshare industry's transition to a zero emissions feature. At the same time, Uber has vowed to contribute $800 million through 2025, to help its drivers switch to battery powered vehicles, including discounts for vehicles bought or leased from partner automakers. We are offering eligible Uber drivers in the U.S. and Canada, a GM employee discount on the purchase of a 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV and U.S. drivers are also eligible for discounts on charging accessories. We will launch a pilot program in Los Angeles and Denver where Uber is most active, and highest mileage drivers can receive special financing through GM financial. And in August, we partnered with EVgo to triple their number of fast chargers in the U.S. Together we will support the installation of 2,700 chargers in city and suburban locations, and they will operate on renewable energy. With all the work we are doing to provide our customers with great EVs, we know we also need to provide technologies that improve all aspects of the driving and ownership experience. In 2017, General Motors introduced Super Cruise, the industry's first true hands free driver assistance system. Over the years, we have continued to add new features and roads to an already robust and a claim system. We'll continue to do that while expanding the technology across our vehicle portfolio. In fact, we'll offer Super Cruise on 22 models by the end of 2023. In China, Super Cruise will be featured on Cadillac's entire lineup by mid-decade, and we'll also expand to Buick and Chevrolet models. 85% of the current Super Cruise users have told us they would prefer or only consider a future vehicle with Super Cruise Technology, and I think that's a pretty powerful endorsement. Our ultimate vision is a system that will enable hands free transportation in 95% of all driving scenarios. We don't have anything specific to announce today, but stay tuned. We are taking on autonomous driving as the engineering challenge of this generation, and we are determined to do so in the right way. Our Cruise team continues to make progress and we'll have more to share yet this year. Putting all of the technology I talked about today and the hands of our customers takes dedicated employees who are committed everyday to our vision. Our team is fully focused on sustainability commitments and we are striving to meet them. By 2030, all of our U.S. facilities will be a 100% powered by a renewable energy, and by 2040 we will source 100% of our global electricity from renewables. GM already enables 100% reuse or recycling of our batteries and will continue to engineer our EV batteries for full reuse and recyclability. We believe they have long-term value and therefore are an asset. We are making strategic decisions that will best position the company for the future, as demonstrated by our ongoing transformation plan and our clear EV and AV roadmaps. GM has the right team, the right partners and the right portfolio of technologies at the right time, and we remain focused on the right priorities. Our employees want to be part of a culture of innovation, transform personal mobility and live a better cleaner planet for our children and their children. So before I turn to your questions, I want to share more about what I think of as the world's first all-electric super truck, the GMC HUMMER EV. We will reveal this truck on Tuesday, October 20. You won't want to miss it and additional details about how you can watch this exciting debut will be shared as we get closer to the reveal. At the same time, we will begin accepting customer reservations through gmc.com. The GMC HUMMER EV will offer up to 1000 horsepower and up to 11,500 pounds-feet of torque, and is part of our EV truck architecture that will be capable of charging 100 miles in 10 minutes. Today we're sharing a short video to show one of the Hummer EV's industry first features. We call it crab mode. And I'd like you to be the first to see the clip. [Audio-Video Presentation] Four-wheel steering capability which allows it to move nearly diagonally, functionality that is tailor-made for our off-road customers. Stay tuned for more updates. But in the meantime, I hope you'll put October 20 on your calendar. Thanks for your kind attention. And now I'm happy to take your questions. Thanks, Mary for all the color. And let's [Indiscernible] that looks exciting. To start, Mary, the topic that you addressed, and you addressed the issue the court is among the method you speak to is really about unlocking value, being what you could do from a corporate structure perspective. The market appears to be stating that there's a cost of capital discrepancy between you and you said new startups. Despite the fact that there's a general belief that among the investors I speak to that you have some pretty good technology there. So how do you approach that challenge? Because it does seem strike of some short-termism versus long-term control of these assets. You can't ignore that cost of capital conundrum because if it does persist and clearly it can stake all your growth. So, how do you go about that? What do you think your options at hand are? And if you stay the course, how do you go about proving youâ€™re Walmart adapting to or thriving really with this like Amazon versus a company being forced to maybe spin-off the [Indiscernible] use? Well, thanks Joe you for the question. And we do remain 100% committed to driving long-term shareholder value. As I've said many times, we will always do what's in the best interest of our shareholders over the long-term, not necessarily for a short-term pop. And we are moving fast to realize the better future that we envision and how we continue to innovate to deliver safe, efficient, connected vehicles and services that lead the industry and will exceed our customers' expectations. So as we look at getting to our goal of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, we're going to continue to deliver and demonstrate our execution capability and our performance. So I think when you look at the fact that we believe EVs are and will continue to be core to GM and our EV strategy reflects a unique combination of strengths, cutting edge technology, proven manufacturing expertise and scale. And when you look back, step back and look at the core capabilities, we want to avoid any scenario where those competencies are compromised or there is a distraction from speed to market. So we'll have more to say about GM's EV strategy in upcoming launches by the end of the year. But our focus is on speed because we know we have the right technology and we have the right plan, and we don't want to do anything to compromise that. Great. And when you say by the end of the year, that's just from a product perspective or also from a strategy perspective? Well, I think we'll continue. If you look at all of the announcement that we have just made in the last month, and everything that we've done since our EV Day in March, we're going to continue to build on our strategy, put proof points on the board, demonstrating that our technology is very, very good to the point that others are using and validating it by their desire to use it, and then the partnerships that we're providing. So we're going to continue to build on that. And I think as all of the elements of our strategy unfold, people will see we have a very clear plan, very realistic, with a focus on speed and with demonstrating EV leadership and building on our technology strength. And maybe just to further just final, but if you could talk about, maybe some of the ease or difficulty with GM actually going through with a spin either in electrical vehicle business or maybe the Ultium Battery business? And what do you think of this concept of GM becoming I'm sorry -- subsidiary of GM becoming more maybe a supplier to industry, to which GM is clearly one of the most important customers? Well, again, we're going to -- we will always look at what unlocks long-term value. But speed, I think, is a very important unlocking value in demonstrating leadership. So, there's a structural side of the conversation and then there's a technology side and a partnership side and an execution leveraging all of the assets that we have. And I think people will see how that all fits together and unfolds as we continue to build on it yet this year. Okay. Maybe to some other news that was in the market. You made this announcement with Nikola recently you are about their -- they're effectively paying you for capacity and access to your technology in the days that followed the company which had been under scrutiny. But can you talk about your view of the Nikola transaction some of the diligence and GMs commitment to the deal? So, our company has worked with a lot of different partners and we're very capable team that has done the appropriate diligence. I understand that Nikola presented a little while earlier, so on the specific issues related to Nikola, I'll let you -- do have that conversation with them. But on the strength of the deal we put together, it validates our technology, it allows us to have more people using the technology, which gives us the advantage of scale, which will help us drive costs down. And then from a fuel cell perspective, using the Hydrotec fuel cell technology and entering a new segment for us, a growth segment, again, validating our fuel cell technology, I think it starts to unlock all new growth area for us as it relates to fuel cells and tapping into in addition to, I'll say, commercial and passenger vehicles, different areas where fuel cells are the appropriate zero emission technology. Maybe to turn the conversation to something that gets mentioned off and on over the years, but probably not enough focus on that is talent. So last year you had to strike, which has been described to me as a talent. I think, on the one hand actually its positive to believe you and your ability to get recognize talent. On the other hand, maybe getting back to the cost of capital and having a currency issue that we were talking about earlier. Are there concerns about talent potentially bringing the new and young talent? So how do you think about GM's approach to that issue? Well, first, Dhivya is truly an outstanding person, who's well respected and is well respected internally, as well as externally and a personal friend of mine. So I will miss her and wish her the best. I think she felt she had an opportunity which allowed her to have a unique growth opportunity. So I wish her nothing but the best. I would say as we look at talent, General Motors is tapping in talent from everywhere, with the recent addition of Alan Wexler, who just joined our team along with Craig Buchholz from a senior leadership perspective. And we continue to have many people join our team. I think an area of focus is in the software space. And we're tapping into graduates from the University of Waterloo with our Markham facility in Canada, that a university is a huge source for talent that sometimes moves to Silicon Valley by offering them the opportunity to stay where they grew up, or where they attended college that is proving to be a very important resource for us. We also have a technology center in Israel, and that is also tapping into an incredible pool of talent. And I would say what the lessons that we have learned with and the world is kind of learning with how we can work remotely, we are active have been and all through the COVID period have been hiring and will continue to hire specific talent that we need in the technical space around software batteries, et cetera. So I would say we continue to bring in great talent. And so, I think this idea that only a company located in Silicon Valley can tap into the best talent is just not true. Any thoughts on either timeline or approach for announcing the search or like a long shift? We are in an active search, and I'm very excited about the progress it's making. So I'm not going to put a timeline on it, but I can tell you I'm very excited about how the search is progressing. And we will have news in the not too distant future. Okay. Maybe, to go back to some of the newer competitors that have been popping up in the market. What I find interesting about is that they seem to be mostly focused on the three most profitable segments in the U.S. So, pickups, work vans, luxury. It kind of makes sense if you think about just a general state -- ability of what your view so that they go up after the more profitable segments. Maybe let's just focus on pickups and maybe more work vans for a second where, we do have bunch of these new players supposedly coming with products and your friends down the street in Dearborn also are planning to electrifying their pickup truck. But many of the startups I think clearly have a lot of work ahead and potentially some challenges ahead of themselves. But for the first time in a while, it does seem like there is more competition in these segments than there has been historically. And basic economics will tell you that market structure is -- market or [Indiscernible] and the like. So what do you exactly means for the segment? And how does GM win profitably in this segment in the future? Well I think you have to step back and understand that the truck segment, the business is structurally different from the rest of the automobile business and the personal and passenger vehicles. It has better underlying growth dynamics and we're seeing that. It has far better margin dynamics. But it also I think is very important, it has strong loyalty, and those become competitive moats around our business. Historically, over 90% of the sales in the sector have been through the top three OEMs, even though others have tried to enter the segment. We set out to increase market share through increasing the richness of our product mix with more differentiation. We've added more crew cabs and we have more trim levels so we are going from high value to high feature. On the Chevrolet Silverado, we expanded the model lineup from five to eight distinct brands and added the trail boss and which has both a high value and a high volume opportunity for us in the market. And our premium LTZ and high crunchy trim levels have been a huge success in the high feature market. Similar is true at GMC with the Denali sub-brand and the AT4 trim mix. They have been just a massive success for us in the premium trucks segment. So as we did this new launch, we took the opportunity to add capacity to the existing pickup truck footprint and to reduce constraints. And that is really fueling the success of our business right now. And, we sell more trucks in the U.S. than anyone by a wide margin. And we are unique that we have not one, but two strong brands and distribution channels with Chevrolet and GMC. So when you translate that, we believe that the battery electric trucks that will build it, the Detroit-Hamtramck plant will leverage this success we've had in the ICE business. We have over 100 years of mass production experience and truck knowledge and knowing what is important to truck buyers. So we know these customers well. We know what they want and what they need an EV truck, and they want a truck that looks great, charges fast and conveniently and then has the right combination of range, power and performance. We also have an outstanding distribution channel and we do not intend to cede our leadership position in this very important segment. And so we continue to -- we'll leverage our strong brands and that customer loyalty and relationship and knowledge.  Okay. Maybe a couple of questions that just set to be came in from investors that sort of tie into this which, I think is, you touched on this a little bit on the call and the company announced it. But if things like loyalty are so important, and again market structure is important. I think just the question is sort of why you would help it would be competitor launching products in Nikola? Well, again, as we look at our -- we find it's another opportunity for General Motors. I mean, I think the industry has been included -- has been accused in the past of not being as efficient as it could be with technology and with leveraging engineering and capital. So the partnership that we have with Nikola and Honda for that matter is doing exactly that. It's leveraging that technology, instead of everyone doing a slightly different version of it, that will included your royalty or licensing or revenue in many different forms coming to General Motors, as well as taking the cost down as the whole industry transforms and transfers to EV models. We will still compete fiercely as it relates to go to market with our strong brands like we do today. This is just a more efficient way to do it. I'll get to scale faster so it's good for the customer, but also is good for the General Motor's shareholder, because our technology is being used more broadly. Another question that came in on electric vehicles there. As you mentioned that the Bolt and the new Bolt EV will be on the current battery. So when is that we get the first Ultium powered electric vehicles? This is in '21 with the Hummer and then Lyriq? Well, it will start to leverage the Ultium technology with the GMC HUMMER EV that launches in '21, and then closely followed by the Cadillac Lyriq is when we'll see the new Ultium Powered system. And you've talked a lot about the flexibility of the Ultium platform if you will. What about on the batteries if chemistry or technology sort of changes what type of flexibility do you have there to make changes? Well, I think with the way we've defined the platform, the wireless management system and the fact that it's a self-learning system. We have already provided a roadmap, because over the life of this first generation of products, we expect significant improvement in our batteries. And so we as part of the design will -- as we get to better battery chemistry, better battery technology that allows us to take write down the cost curve, we'll be able to leverage those. So it's really, I'm really proud of the way the team has designed the Ultium system. Maybe, if you could shift conversation to Cruise, I think you gave us a little bit. You mentioned some strong technical progress and expecting some exciting updates in the second-half of this year. So we've got about three months left, anything you want to say will be appreciated. But in the absence of that. If you just help me and the market understand, what type of milestone should we really be looking here for Cruise? And -- well, let's pause there and it's depend how you answer that question. Well, what I have said is that there's more -- that you'll hear about Cruise yet this year. So it is only three months, but three very important months, Joe. As we look at all how fast we're moving, and General Motors remains more than ever committed to Cruise and the work they're doing. Even through the COVID period, they have been continuing to make progress on that the technology development, not only with miles on the road, but also with improved simulation capability. So I see -- we set out a path and a milestone curve of what we needed to demonstrate, to be able to do what Kyle talks about is demonstrate superhuman driving performance or performance better than a human driver. And we haven't shared a lot of details about that for competitive reasons, but we continue to hit milestone-after-milestone. And that's what gives us confidence that we'll be able to share more yet this year. So I don't want to take anything away from Dan and Kyle, because they're working so hard. I think what it'll also do is demonstrate the importance of how seamlessly the vehicle company, the engineers from General Motors have worked with the engineers from Cruise, that we can move quickly and continue to improve the technology, continue to be measuring to safety that we need to demonstrate. And so it will be not only a validation of the technology, but a validation of the model and how that enabled the speed. Mark always mentioned that electric vehicles are away from GM to reset the brand or I might be paraphrasing here but to some factor in. I think that's right, because the electric vehicles enable a whole new functionality. But I do want to understand some of GM's thinking about putting EVs into existing brands, as opposed to either taking one brand and making an effort or potentially creating a new brand and making electric. So if you just walk us through GM's strategy on that? Well, I think when you step back in General Motors, we've clearly said that we believe in an all-EV future, and our brands we have seen very strong performance and growth in brand loyalty. And overall, I think we have the highest loyalty in the industry and also that relationship with the customer and what they believe, whether it's their Cadillac, their Chevrolet, they're Buick, their GMC, what that means to them and what it represents from a quality perspective, from a safety perspective. So we are going to leverage that strong market presence. Let's remember in the United States with those four brands, we do sell more vehicles than anyone else in the United States. So leveraging those brands, that relationship we have, we think is very important to accelerating and demonstrating quickly our EV leadership capability. Just, I'm trying to sort of holistically sort of put together a bunch of investor questions as they're coming here. But I guess as it relates maybe to some of the sourcing decisions you made with Honda or Nikola? And how if the high volume is so large, maybe that impacts some GM volume and their profitability. But maybe the way to ask the question is, if you are a supplier of Ultium care [ph] and Ultium cells to a third party, is that EBIT positive or negative or neutral versus selling just a GM vehicle today? Well, I think if you look overall, it depends on which GM vehicle you're talking about. But I think we're looking to from an overall where we are from a margin perspective, I think it is in the same ballpark, but then accretive because it's a growth opportunity for us. Okay. Let's see you moving on, I wanted to get your sense of your view and approach with some of these tech companies, because on the margin it does seem like you're a little bit more of a conical big tech into the vehicle and you are not the last using the Google Android operating system. I think you're also integrating Alexa SDK. How do you strike the balance between providing what the customer wants and seizing control of the customer in GM experiments? Well, with every decision that we make, our customers are our priority in giving them the best experience we can in our vehicles is what guides our decisions. And so when you look at what customers want as it relates to connectivity or an assistant, they want to have a seamless experience that's no different from their home, from their phone, et cetera. And so that's what we've been working on doing. But rest assured, we work as we build the relationship with these different companies to make sure it's following our whole global vehicle development process, so to assure quality and safety, but then also that we have the right relationship with the customer, even with the introduction of this technology. So, again, I view this as a way that we can leverage the best voice capability, a platform that others are using, so as opposed to deliver our own so it becomes much more efficient. But General Motors has been very careful, as we crafted each one of these relationships to make sure we have the right relationship with the customer and we're going to be able to ensure we can deliver quality and safety. All right, a couple more coming in from investors here. Another one, and we sort of touched on this a little bit earlier. But, as it was just the cost of capital again versus of EV peers. I mean, is that the primary sort of focus that you and the board are really focused on? As you sort of evaluate what can be done with the GM electric vehicle strategy? And Joe, I didn't hear the very beginning of the question, so I'm not sure. Sorry. The question is, as you evaluate the electric vehicle strategy, how high on the priority list is the cost of capital to charge? Well, obviously, it's very important. But as we look at it, we also and being that we have a very strong ICE business with franchises like full-sized trucks, our mid-sized vehicles and in the areas where we do business in the United States and China specifically, that generates a lot of free cash flow that we can reinvest in the business. And so, cost of capital is very important, but we do have this nice business that is helping us fund it. And we are not constrained for capital. Okay. So I guess ask a different way. Is there anything preventing GM from either making any harder pivot bigger investments into electric vehicles or sunset into the ICE vehicles? Or does that make it difficult because of what you just mentioned, where you're trying to use some of those, high profitable ICE vehicle programs to help fund that transition? Well, I think the way that we look at it, we are planning for a range of outcomes of how fast EV adoption will be. And because of the strong investment and the strong products we have, when you look at our full-sized truck, our full-sized SUV that we're launching right now, by the way we can't keep them in the dealerships. People are buying them off the trucks on the way there that shows the strength of this franchise. And our midsize SUVs and beyond, when you look at the strength of that business and the investment we made in platforms, we can really dial in our investment because of the previous investment. It's very minimal of what we need to do to remain in a leadership position in those segments over the next -- you tell me how long it is, as the EV adoption occurs. So we're well positioned for a variety of scenarios. What we're really focused now with our investment in our engineering is making sure that we have a full range of electric vehicles across high demand, high volume segments as well as premium, because that's the way we're going to see grow get more scale get the cost down. So that is where we're focused, and we have a really strong ICE business that we can adjust to whatever the market wants. But our intent is to drive EV adoption by having great products with the right range that are affordable and that people have confidence in the charging infrastructure that exists. That's why we've done so much and what we've done looking at the whole ecosystem. So we want to drive adoption and we're well positioned to do that. When you look at all of our manufacturing capability and the fact with the Ultium system, we can go into mainstream segments. Maybe just a final question. As you put capital into grant today or the capital exists, is there any way you can tell us how flexible some of that capital is in order to sort of Nikola transition is the sort of percentage of it reusable, as you make that transition from SUV? We are looking at how -- when we facilitate any one of our factories, manufacturing facilities, we are always looking at how much of it can we reuse as we make that transformation. There's been a lot of work going on that already. And we'll continue to do that. So I can't give you a specific percentage, Joe. It's actually an interesting question, I'll go back and do some work on. But I will tell you that we will be customer-driven and hopefully spur EV adoption. But we're building in flexibility to be responsive. Great. Well, I think we're out of time. I wanted to on behalf of RBC, again thank you for joining us today. I think we're all looking forward to some of the timelines you laid out from this conversation today, so thanks for joining us. Thanks, for all the [Multiple Speakers]. Thank you for the opportunity Joe. Thank you. Thank you. Take care.
