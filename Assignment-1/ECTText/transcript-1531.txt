Hello everyone. I am Amit Harchandani, Head of Citi’s European Tech Research Team and your host for this Virtual Keynote Session on SAP as part of Citi’s 27th Global Technology Conference. Thanks for joining us and I do hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy.  Before I move on to introducing our main speaker, I would like to highlight that we are keen to take questions from investors joining us on this fireside chat. So please send those over directly to me at amit.harchandani@citi.com and I shall ask them on your behalf. Alternatively, there is also a box on the right-hand side of the interface if you would like to type in and send those across.  As a next step, it is my pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker, SAP’s CFO, Luka Mucic. Luca, it is a pleasure to have you with us and thanks for supporting our conference every year. I would also add that SAP Head of IR, Stefan Gruber is on the call as well.  Right. So there is one last thing I need to do before we go into Q&A with Luca, which is to read a short Safe Harbor statement. So, here comes my best imitation of Mr. Gruber. Please note that except for certain information matters discussed today during today’s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. The factors that could affect SAP’s future financial results are discussed more fully in SAP’s most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Alright, so the disclaimer is out of the way. Let us begin Luca and I would like to start our discussion with a focus on one of the core elements of SAP’s intelligent enterprise strategy, which is sustainability and Climate 2021. Help us better understand how this fits into the overall SAP roadmap and how SAP is helping its customers manage their green line which in turn will translate into an impact I guess for SAP’s bottom-line?  Sorry. Maybe moving on to another element of the firm’s strategy, which I believe Christian has referred to as doubling down on categories where SAP has the right to win. I sense this sharper emphasis which is a shift versus what we have heard in the past, for example from build as SAP continues its multi-year transition to the cloud. Your thoughts on that please? Indeed. We’ll touch upon some of those aspects like partnerships and integration as we move through this discussion. But I’ve already seen one question, which has come in, so let me weave it in, because maybe it fits in here which is, so what does this mean for the whole strategy around C/4HANA and in particular, the customer relationship market? How should we think about that versus what we have heard from SAP in the past?  Thank you, Luka. Thank you for the clarification. Another element if I may, of course of your strategies, the whole move towards industry cloud and you’ve talked about Siemens earlier, right, you’ve entered into these strategic partnerships with of course, Siemens. There was the announcement with Honeywell. Could you give us a sense for what’s been the customer feedback so far? And how can we as the financial community track your progress? Do you plan to provide us with further disclosure on this topic?  Thank you, Luka. And again, maybe staying with this topic of sharpening the focus, it appears to me at least that the management is not shy of drawing the line between the infrastructure layer and the stack above. So help us understand your views on the ownership of the application layer, if I could call it that way and what that means for your relationship with the hyperscalers?  Alright. I think you have phrased it nicely. The rules of engagement that need to be laid out clearly. Let’s go back to a term you briefly mentioned earlier in one of your responses, integration and I note that the firm targets 90% integration completion in terms of some of the key items on the roadmap by the end of this year. Help us understand where we are today in terms of the progress and to what extent do you think would this drive - this integration drive the financial performance of the firm and the adoption of S/4HANA?  Thank you, Luka. I guess, you have talked about some of the strategic topics, but one of the critical debates which comes around the SAP investment case and this has been the case for a while now. Is the balance of growth and margin and at SAPPHIRE, most recently we got the impression that that management believes its first priority remains to capture growth including the incremental opportunities which may emerge post the pandemic with margins maybe being second. Can you reassure yours as we look forward to the targeted 500 basis points of margin expansion that still remains a critical objective for the firm?  Alright. So you talked some big pictures, some strategic questions, let’s maybe take a pivot towards some of the near-term dynamics now, Luka, starting of course with the announcement to IPO Qualtrics. Can you give us an update on where we are in the process potential implication for second half of the year? And even further out as we look towards some of your medium-term targets?  Thanks, Luka. Alright. So, picking up pace, so let’s start talking a bit more about the second half of the year now. Your outlook assumes a gradual improvement. Can you give us an update on what you have seen in July and August so far a sense, particularly for some of that business which is more transactional and whether there is a recovery coming through this in line with your expectations?  That’s interesting. You said some of the business is actually trending better than you would have maybe anticipated in July, August. Could you talk a bit more about that? Are there any trends that you see by regions? For example, the other question which comes up is, have you felt any direct or indirect impact from the ongoing trade tensions between U.S. and China? So if you could elaborate a bit on that please.  I actually want to weave in a question here which has come in from the East Coast in the U.S. The client is, I guess, is listened to one of your competitors, one of your traditional competitors talk on the earnings call about making inroads. I guess, he refers here to Oracle making strong inroads into SAP’s top-10 customer base and going after the top-50. Could you give us a sense for how do you view the competitive landscape?  Okay. Thanks for the clarification. So, moving onto maybe revenue streams, Q4 obviously plays a critical role and there is still some debate about new licenses. Yes, there is the focus on cloud, but new license is still of course a matter. Could you very quickly give us a sense for how your pipeline is shaping up to be, particularly, because even SAPPHIRE was a virtual event this year than it’s seen as an opportunity for you to build the pipeline. So, maybe if you could talk a little about the dynamics on the license side?  Great. Maybe moving on to the cloud now. We’ve all seen the current cloud backlog. The new metric that you have given us. It was up about 21% in the second quarter, 24% year-on-year in the first quarter. Some would do the math since a quarter-on-quarter the current backlog did not go up. How should investors think about this metric? Because we don’t have that historical context. So maybe help us understand what’s the right level of growth that you target on a year-on-year or a sequential basis?  Thank you, Luka. Maybe moving on to margins now, we’ve obviously talked about public cloud or broadly cloud gross margins expanding to 75% by 2023. You began this year with a target of 71%, which is now down to 70%, partly of course it’s mix. We know that. But maybe help us understand what gives you the confidence that the trajectory picks up again and hits the target for 2023?  Alright. And just cognizant of time. So we have to maybe fit in two questions towards the end. The first or the second last question is, cash generation. Your outlook talks about a significant step-up in free cash flow generation. Yes, there is operational profitability. Yes, the CapEx is more modest. Is there anything else that you missed that should help us bridge the gap up to that free cash flow target? And where would you see is the most upside coming from?  Fantastic. And the final question for this session, and here I am probably combining two or three different questions from the audience is, the last twelve months have been a period of significant top management change at SAP. But I guess, the CFO of course has been ever present. There was also an announcement last week about a new Board member. Can you comfort the investors that despite these changes, execution remains disciplined and there should be no concern with regards to the employee morale within the firm? Well, well. We certainly look forward to seeing you and working with you, Luka. And once again, thank you for taking out the time to join us for this session. We are out of time. Thank you for the audience. Stay safe. Stay healthy. Have a nice day all. Bye. Yes. Thanks a lot, Amit, for having me and thanks for the great imitation of Stefan Gruber, as well. And particular thanks for starting off with a question that is indeed close to my heart and that I am passionate about also as SAP internal what sponsor for our own sustainability efforts.  We have been a long-term believer in the significance of focusing as a company, not only on our financial performance, but also on our environmental and social performance and we have adopted integrated steering mechanisms in order to support that.  But while we have been for many years the leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for our industry, we believe that we can make an even greater impact as an enabler now through our customer base. Now there would be no doubt while of course at the moment everybody is occupied with the short-term challenges that the pandemic is bringing to us.  The 21st century’s greatest challenge remains by far, climate change and how we can rally together to fight it and for many companies in different industries, I can attest to this being sitting on the supervisory board of a cement company for example, the environmental performance, the ability to bring down the carbon footprint is really becoming a matter that is defining the license to operate.  And we believe that we are uniquely positioned by integrating the data model and the Datalogics that are necessary to identify across the entire value chain of companies, the individual elements that drive the carbon footprint and then defining through intelligent digital business processes ways to bring them down that we can make a huge impact towards an integrated environmental and carbon footprint management system for our companies.  That’s what we are striving to achieve starting with S/4HANA where the S/4 application will include the Datalogics to really get a full visibility across the end-to-end business process landscapes of our customers adopting S/4 around their carbon performance and we see a lot of interest from customers that want to co-innovate and that want to lead with us and it’s a great factor therefore that will further accelerate the move and the migration to S/4HANA.  So, we couldn’t be more excited about that and in return, we believe that this will also have a very positive impact on our economic performance too. You are on mute, Amit? There is no doubt that focus is an essential part of our strategy that we have defined jointly in the executive board. Look, we have an extremely broad portfolio of software solutions and many of them luckily are market leaders and where we have a very strong position where we are the number one and number two and indeed, we believe that we still have great runway across all of those respective markets and we want to double down on extending our lead in this respect.  That would clearly comprise areas like core ERP and supply chain management. It comprises areas like spend management where we also clearly are the market leader. But also areas like, human experience management with the combination of SuccessFactors and Qualtrics, analytics, data management with our HANA platform and certain elements of our customer experience portfolio like e-commerce for example where we see very, very strong demand.  Next to that, we believe that we absolutely have an opportunity to strengthen and cross-fortify the market position that those assets individually have through focusing on integration. That’s another aspect that Christian has been very clear on about that this is a core priority for SAP. We invest 10% to 15% of our portfolio capacity in really deep level end-to-end business process integration across those assets.  And that will continue to solidify our market position in those strong old markets and allow us to grow. But we are not only playing defense. We clearly see a great growth opportunity in adjacent capabilities where we have equally a right to win. So this is not only what we have today, but also what we want to build in the future.  One key category is to build native cloud applications for industry-specific processes and new scenarios where we have a strong trust of our customers due to our strong industry business process, heritage, other areas would relate to additional business networks beyond spend management like supply chain networks, logistics networks and also new platform capabilities, such as for example, business process intelligence.  And we believe that this is first of all a strategy that has an optimal risk and rewards profile for SAP. And some of those new adjacent areas have actually tremendous total addressable market. So, they offer lots of space for SAP. The flip side is though that we are also going to be disciplined about looking at alternative options for areas of the portfolio where we have not been able to build such a strong position over the course of quite many years. And in those areas, it does not mean that we are exiting the market, but we have smart partnership opportunities. For example, you have seen our recent announcement around the partnership with Siemens in product lifecycle management and certainly we are looking at a few more of those examples, which again are going to be accretive to our growth opportunity. We are very bullish about the strategy.  So, first of all, customer experience is absolutely a key market in which we want to be a significant player. But with a focus on those categories where we clearly see that there is potential for SAP to be a strong number one or number two player.  There is a very obvious one in which we are leading the market that’s the whole area of experience management, where we have the Qualtrics, a category leader and that we are truly excited about and we are obviously looking at a partial IPO of Qualtrics to we even further exemplify and magnify our growth opportunities. The other area, as I mentioned before is e-commerce, where we have with Hybris a very strong cloud fit that is growing in the high double-digits, that is in huge demand these days in particular with the challenges introduced by COVID, one of the core investment priorities for many companies around the globe.  And then also areas like customer data cloud, for example, where we also have a leading solution that can help customers manage the GDPR and triggers these – of digital sales motion in a way that is conducive to consumer preferences. And so in those areas we absolutely continue to invest and we see great growth opportunities.  In others, that from our perspective more translate into commodity markets where the growth rates are coming down and we are – admittedly there is clear market leadership by others. We might look also at one or the other partnership opportunity and in the mean time of course, we see that the ties lifts many boats in many of those areas and so we will continue to look practically at an opportunity to participate in this growth.  But we don’t necessarily see it as an area in which we would dramatically double down in investments. But clearly, CX remains a critical pillar of our cloud strategy, just in a little bit more focus sense.  Yes. First of all, customer feedback is extremely positive. There are actually quite a few more early examples already of customers who are co-innovating with us around with some of those new cloud-native industry-specific applications. Utilities is another example where we have closed earlier this year strategic partnership and significant commercial arrangement with the German utility E.ON to provide a next-generation cloud-based filling solution for them to support their industry transformation and they are further down the road.  We believe that we have a natural right to win in this space for various reasons. First of all, there is clear demand now accelerated by COVID customers learn to appreciate that digital agile capabilities to device new ways of going to market, new business processes and next-generation industry for that all scenarios in the cloud are of paramount importance, they see SAP as a trusted co-innovator, because of our strong heritage and industry know how that we have.  It’s a natural playground for partnerships, as well, because many of our key global SI partners and other critical software development partners have industry-specific core competencies that they can bring to bear by co-innovating with us on the SAP cloud platform, which will be the key delivery mechanism from a platform perspective on which those cloud apps will all be developed.  So that they can ensure seamless integration in our S/4 core, digital core, as well. And that’s why we believe that we can scale and accelerate pretty fast, because we don’t need to do all of the grinding work by ourselves. We will lead key development efforts across some of the core industries where we are particularly strong in other areas co-innovation is absolutely a viable option. And the early demand from the market is signaling a very, very positive business case for the next couple of years in this respect. And of course, we will continue to update the markets transparently around our progress through the earnings calls, through Capital Markets days, through individual interactions sharing also some of the examples as we do usually that where we have had significant wins with customers.  What is not likely is that we would break out industry cloud as a separate reporting segment, because it’s very close to our core R&D efforts. It will be basically mainly an organic development effort so closely embedded with our functional organization. But we will find other ways to provide you the transparency that you’ve come to appreciate from SAP.  That’s a good question, but one where it’s also very important to clarify that we absolutely love and stay extremely loyal to the strategy that we have embarked on a couple of years ago to display openness when it comes to the infrastructures of choice of our customers and making sure that our application can run on all of the hyperscaler infrastructures whether that’s Azure or whether that’s a WS Google Cloud or in Asia in China also Alibaba, I think that strategy has helped us to scale our business very successfully.  It’s much appreciated by customers and definitely preferred over in an attempt to lock in customers in an end-to-end way across an entire spec of the IT industry and we will remain focused on this strategy. Now having said this, it is a very complementary strategy that allows our hyperscale partners to make sure that significant workloads, some of the SAP applications, in particular, ERP applications of course have a huge volume that they can bring to their infrastructures.  And so, therefore, we have a strong partnership with them in order to make sure that we successfully migrate our customers to hyperscaler infrastructure. It’s also our own preferred deployment model next to our own converged cloud infrastructure for our own public cloud SaaS applications. So, this is perfectly complementary.  What we want to make clear is that, in all of those conversations, the application layer, as well as the platform layers where integration happens, where innovation happens, where analytics processes on top of SAP data are run, we really want to keep, retain and own these layers on behalf of our customers.  And that’s for a very simple reason only SAP will be optimally able to translate the data models of our applications in corresponding platform services that customers can the utilize to innovate on top and that is a proposition that we definitely want to keep and we are making this clear in all of the relationships which are nevertheless are mutually beneficial.  And yes, there might be some areas of overlap and competition as a result of the fact that also the hyperscalers are going up the spec. But that has always been a reality in our industry and I believe there is much more to be gained by cooperating in this respect. Just important that the rules of engagement actually are.  Yes. Let me back up first and explain what 90% integration means, because it’s the 90% of what is a very valid question. So, what we have said is that, we want to make sure that across the core end-to-end business processes that are typically running through SAP applications, there are four of them quite frankly.  There is obviously hire to retire in the age are inside of those that’s procure to pay between spend management and S/4HANA. There is lead to cash or C/4 and S/4HANA and there is design to operate. We want to make sure that our respective applications that are covering those end-to-end business processes by the end of the year are able to achieve a couple of very important deep level integration qualities.  This is not only high-level technical API-based integration which we have had for many years. We are talking about a common user experience, a common analytics layer, common reporting structures based on SAP Analytics cloud and that is permitted across all of the applications as a consistent analytics layer, a common data model, extremely important.  So that master data definitions for example are the same that you are talking about a supplier and the same language whether you are in a revamp or in S/4, the same for an employee between success factors as well as S/4 and so on and so forth. And then a common application lifecycle management and user management and a common layer of security across all of those applications.  And that’s where we are currently more than 50% completing in achieving this across those four business processes and will be 90% complete by the end of this year. What does this mean? It means that the implementation effort for customers that are adopting a variety of our solutions across multiple pillars will go down, because they don’t need to invest into project-driven integrations, through the technical means that exists and are available that means there is more money left to invest into the core into software-based innovation.  It will bring down barriers to adoption, as well, because that will shrink the complexity of going through implementations across various application pillars and so for us, it is a key conduit to our ambition to actually accelerate as we move out of the crisis and see the tail end of COVID coming to accelerate our growth in the cloud and that’s why it’s of strategic importance. And last but not least, it’s a clear customer demand and you are always wise to respond to prioritize customer demand, as well.  Yes. First of all, I think we have just off the Q2 that reaffirmed our 2023 ambition and that has all elements included the top-line as well as the bottom-line and the margin targets. So, there should actually not be any doubt towards our commitment, towards not only driving for growth, but also increasing efficiency across our business and you should have seen some of this at play as well now through the crisis we actually managed so far in the first half year to further increase the margin despite the challenges that we have seen on the top-line.  We have taken immediate measures to curtail discretionary expenses, but not at the cost of the long-term growth. So we keep investing in R&D for example, all in line with this striking this as we balance to set us up for the growth opportunities that we see when we reach the tail-end of the crisis. And as a result of that, you continue to see a healthy gross margin development across all of our business models and that’s something that we absolutely aspire to achieve also in the future.  Now, let’s be clear, when you take a look at our 2023 ambition, it’s very clear that there is a sequence in those targets, there has always been. It starts off with our goal to reach $15 billion in cloud revenues, it follows through with the total revenue ambition of $35 billion. Plus, then come the gross margin targets of 75% for the cloud and then of course, also the company-level margin target.  But we believe that in order to support the long-term sustainability of our business, job number one is to make sure that we maximize our opportunities that come with our business model transformation for predictable recurring revenues in the cloud.  We actually see it that despite the fact that COVID has a dampening impact in particular on our transactional revenues and for some of the new initiatives that we have been talking about and the great demand and excitement that we see in the market, we have an opportunity to double down on this growth and potentially accelerate it as we exit the crisis.  And we would not have to sacrifice this opportunity for SAP by staying one dimensionally focused on the company level margin target. So, we will know a lot better as we move through the tail end of this year as well as size up the opportunity that the new strategy is bringing to us which is not the easiest feat as you might appreciate in the current uncertainty that you are facing about how this mechanically then plays out and we’ll update the markets as we speak.  But our commitment and Christian has made this very clear also at our recent earnings event towards driving for efficiency across all aspects of our business remains absolutely strong and will always remain strong, because we know that we have lots of runway left to optimize our performance in this respect.  Yes. First of all, the excitement is still absolutely there across all of SAP. Of course, first and foremost at Qualtrics, but also at SAP equally, because we believe this is a perhaps unexpected, but extremely promising move to set up Qualtrics for a greater independence that will allow them to more effectively penetrate non-SAP ecosystems.  That’s the primary strategic purpose of us going ahead with the IPO. And while we do that, we will absolutely remain focused on penetrating the installed base through the great partnership that we have established across the firm in selling Qualtrics into our installed base, combining joint SKUs of solutions with SuccessFactors, for example with CX and other areas that we are working on and to bring them to bear as OEM bundles for our customers.  So it’s really the best of both worlds. What we try to achieve with the IPO and I believe this will set up Qualtrics as a absolute category leader in a market that is already at round about $50 billion USD and strongly growing in terms of total addressable market.  And we are currently busy as you have asked for the status in preparing for all of the documentation that you need to submit as you file for an IPO that’s quite a tedious amount of work that is happening on these days.  We are not done yet with this and I cannot give you at the moment a precise point in time where we would then ultimately look to file. But of course, we try to do this as expeditiously but also as diligently as we need to.  In terms of the impacts on SAP, be it in the second half you are also into the future, there is actually if anything only an impact to be expected in terms of fully harvesting the growth potential of Qualtrics, we will continue to fully consolidate the results of Qualtrics as that we have every intention to stay a long-term majority shareholder of the company. And so, from that perspective, the fee effect of the IPO will not have an impact on the company and its performance.  Of course, Qualtrics will have a traditional equity-based share-based compensation plan going forward whereas our own SAP plans are cash settled programs. So, you will see a certain trade in of cash settled impacts versus equity settled dilution at Qualtrics later on. That should in aggregate actually for especially cash flow focused investors a positive, but other than that, it’s going to be all about setting up Qualtrics for growth and enjoying that growth as part of the combined SAP group P&L.  Yes. So, first of all, of course, in terms of the more bookings-based business models or entry, I think we have seen a pretty solid performance in July, August, we are actually in many categories slightly ahead in terms of our linearity which is what we have closed already compared to last year. But that really should not be an indicator that we should too much focus on, because in our business, the last few days of the quarter really define whether it’s a good one or not such a good one.  Typically, close 50% of our new order entry in the last couple of days. So, it’s too early to tell, but the pipeline feels actually solid in line with what we would have anticipated at this point in time. When it comes to the transactional business, yes, we are seeing a slow recovery. But there equally it’s too early to tell for many of those transaction volume-based businesses.  There is also a heavier bias towards the fourth quarter. For example, in spent management, lot of companies are transacting particularly in Q4 as they are looking to flush out their budgets, so to say for the year and I have to say the transactional business has been hurt in particular in Concur and Concur is perhaps the one area where why we have seen certain relaxations in travel, availability across the cost in EMEA and the usual levels that you would have seen in the past.  This is a business that usually contributes $300 million or so to Concur’s results from a top-line perspective and would be under normal circumstances expected to grow in the low double-digits. Obviously, now it has been down by 80% in the first half year and why we see now a gradual recovery, it’s not yet at a level that would be back to normal.  And so the interesting piece now will be how is the rest of the spend management portfolio going to do and that I think will determine then where so to say in the broad range of outcomes we will land with our cloud business, still a little bit too early to tell. But if you have a higher mid triple-digit million business that in this first half has been down in double-digits due primarily to Concur, of course, this has an impact while the rest of the cloud business is extremely healthy and resilient where high renewal rates we have.  You see that also in the current cloud backlog. So, as we see the tail end of the crisis arriving going into next year, it’s no doubt that also for in the transactional revenues in our spend network will significantly come up again and then contribute to growth again.  Yes. On the last point, I am not really, quite frankly, I mean, those tensions have been around for quite some while, I have to say. And I think, customers are more focused on capabilities that will help them to master this uncertain environment more positively and successfully. And so the main drivers I think are pretty much unchanged from what we have seen unfolding in Q2.  We see a very positive demand environment relative to what now would have to expected in a worst case scenario in Asia. We continue to see markets like Japan, for example doing extremely well, being very resilient. Korea is another example. And so, I think this is a very positive development in Asia. In the Americas what is interesting t see is, that during the crisis the trends that we have always seen this market as a frontrunner in towards the cloud is actually accelerating.  So, the relative spread in terms of our business volume that we are driving in the cloud versus in on-premise is actually further accelerating and fueling towards the cloud which is positive for us. And so, and in Europe, it’s really more a matter, not so much of solutions, but of individual markets. We see ones that are more challenged, in particular, in the southern part of Europe, where also infection rates are starting to climb up.  And that is clearly concerning I think to some market participants whereas in the northern part of Europe, we actually see a quite resilient and constructive demand environment. Let’s see how it plays out. In our business, it’s never over until it’s over. And then of course, we will be better positioned to give you an update in October.  I have taken this very seriously and I have tried to research all of our client base not even the top-10 or top-50, but going even further down and I make sure what our competitors are talking about there. We are not aware of any competitive replacement. We actually are aware of quite a few we have competitively replaced other ERP solutions from our traditional competition through S/4HANA recently.  That goes across all geographies and many different industries, automotive, financial services, telecommunications, and from that perspective, I can only say, we, from our own data and from our own intelligence believe that we continue to gain market share in our strong holds in ERP and supply chain management in particular.  And I think also the relative growth that we are able to post versus that traditional competitor in my humble opinion actually speaks the clear language and perhaps at some point there will be more transparency given to us what exactly and which customer is exactly competition is talking about. But I have checked and we have not lost a single customer.  Yes. I mean, in Q1, we clearly saw a short-term demand shock when the lockdowns happened and that hurt the license business significantly. We also had a lack of significant transactions, because frankly some customers really paused at least for the immediate future on moving ahead with some of those more significant ones.  The good news is, that’s kind of lockdown in terms of more significant transactions has actually paused in Q2 and we saw already that the confidence of customers, in particular on larger transactions has returned. You are right. I mean, it’s always a challenge and a certain unknown as we are having for the first time a fully virtual demand generation approach and not only through SAPPHIRE, but also many other events that have been virtualized.  But what I see is that, we clearly have sizable transactions that are starting to build up. To what extent they will translate into actual business that we will close in Q4 is always an uncertainty in today’s time, probably even more so, because nobody can predict also what will happen in the next few months. We don’t have a crystal ball either.  The only thing we can say at this point is that, with a implied full year license figure that is baked into items that is pointing to low-20s to mid-20s of license declines against the first half year in which we have seen actually a gradual improvement in Q2 already which we would not have necessarily expected. I believe, we have that kind of proper level of prudence built into our guidance and definitely don’t see anything in the current pipeline that would contradict our ability to deliver against those expectations.  But I also want to make very clear, because I’ve seen kind of some commentary from some of your colleagues that we are now sandbagging and that we are very conservative and remaining with our guidance. There is still a virus out there. Nobody knows how it will affect all of us in the next weeks and months. And we need to fight for each and order.  And so, this is not a time to frolic and lay back. We still have to be on the tip of our toes. But the commitment that I can give to you is that we will definitely not leave any stone unturned to deliver against our intrinsic implied commitment and then we will see what the ultimate outcome is end of December.  Yes, from a sequential perspective, you clearly should expect that given the higher amount of order entry that we close in the fourth quarter, also the current cloud backlog would see a steeper step in a Q4 of a given year and then in the first half of the year the sequential growth from that high basis is not – cannot be expected to be significant but rather flattish in nature.  That being said, on a normal circumstances we would have expected a slight increase Q2 versus Q1 which obviously were in reality it was really more flattish in nature. But that is exactly the impact of COVID that you see in particular and through some customer concessions that we had to do with customers that perhaps had a ramp schedule in their renewals that we adjusted in order to give them some breathing room.  That’s baked into our – in our P&L assumptions that we had around the COVID impact. But of course it affects the backlog a bit, but as you see, I mean, it’s still trading at very healthy growth levels and certainly in Q4, you should then expect a more significant step up.  Yes. First of all, because it’s really only the mix effect and the dampening impact in particular that we see in growth in our spend management transactional revenues which happen to be the most profitable asset. So, that of course has a bearing. But all of the underlying drivers of efficiency that we have been working on very successfully for the last, close to two years, I think are still driving an underlying improvement that is quite sizable.  The 4 plus 1 cloud infrastructure consolidation that we have been driving our work with hyperscalers to ensure that we don’t have idle capacity that we used to have through our more siloed approach towards individual line of business-centric cloud delivery operations is a key lever that continues to do great benefits for us as is the consolidation of the underlying databases of our cloud solutions away from third-party databases onto HANA.  We have completed that work now finally and focus also for a rebound which was a significant step. And so, you have seen as a result of that that in the first half year, actually each and every one of our business models in the cloud, public cloud, Software-as-a-Service, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, as well as the business networks have actually been up from a gross margin perspective.  We believe in spend management, it will be tougher then given the transactional revenue impact to further increase from that level for – in the short-term. That was originally anticipated and then of course, the mix would have been much different with a normal transactional revenue performance. Now the rate of Infrastructure-as-a-Service, which has greatly improved its margin in the second quarter, it was 36 point something percent.  So, very significant step up, but the relative rate has increased and therefore the mark when you take the total is in the short-term not going to work out to 71%, but only to the 70% from our expectations perspective. But that is saying nothing about the long-term improvement potential, because it’s only driven by those short-term top-line challenges that we are facing and hence I remain absolutely confident about the gross margin improvement.  But as a last point, not only the cloud, we have in the first half, we have been increasing the software and support margin despite the fact that it’s already at a very high level and we have been significantly increasing our services margin. So this is where you can see our focus on really a holistic efficiency improvement program that we continue to run all across the company.  Yes. It’s certainly mainly that, I mean, CapEx has come down significantly. It’s now hovering at below $1 billion, probably for 2020. And we believe we can keep it at this level also for the next few years and then of course, the operational profitability, but there is one additional element and that is that the cash flow performance in the last two years was really, I would say, almost artificially brought down through significant one-time effects, one-time cash tax outflows, as well as also the restructuring program that we did last year.  And since, we don’t have these effects in the cash flow profile anymore, and we actually have also had even this year while we were cautious at the beginning and very positive and brought us the customer base cash inflow performance and collections performance. We continue to see that there is great improvement potential. We have actually after the last quarter, again re-upgraded so to say our cash flow guidance for the year from a reduction that we had put after Q1 because of the COVID impact.  But we see that we are actually doing slightly better than that. And perhaps there is even further scope for improvement, because the CapEx levels that we are seeing now, I think still point to a chance that we might even end up at a lower level than what we have seen last year.  Yes. So, first of all, in terms of execution being disciplined, I think, when you take a look at the last twelve months, I think we had a very solid performance. We ended 2019 with hitting all of the targets that we had set at the beginning of the year. And I think we have been fairing pretty well through the COVID crisis so far.  So, the company absolutely remains focused on executing against its objectives. And also you should put the management’s ability a little bit into perspective, yes, there have been changes at the top management level, yes, excluding myself, that’s true. I am still around and I have just prolonged my contract for another five years into 2026. So, I think that should speak for stability for sure.  But also, when you take a look at the file and ranks of our senior leadership, there has been actually greater stability at this level where the true operators, the once that are really touching the local markets, that are touching the core R&D areas of operating than what we have seen for a long time before.  Folks like DJ Paoni, for example who is running our North America business has been around for quite a few years and has with his team done a remarkable job in further penetrating this market which is not our home turf, so to say, but it’s the home turf of many of our competitors and the same holds true for our European business where we have seen great leadership stability in Asia.  Scott Russell there has been around for quite a few years. Now there is a stable hand on the operational steering wheel here. Employee engagement is up despite the crisis, we are at a record level of an employee engagement index of 86.  We never had that since we are measuring it and that I think speaks to the comfort and confidence that also the employee base of SAP has in the future of the company, I am very grateful for that and indeed, we have now a great addition to the team with Sabine Bendiek coming onboard early in 2021 as our new Chief Human Resources Officer and later then also a Chief Operating Officer.  She comes with a wealth of experience from Microsoft, the world-class company and partner where she has been an important General Manager and I think she will be a great round up to the team and I can’t wait to welcome her. And then together with all of my colleagues execute on a very clear and concise strategy that we have laid out and that’s how we feel will set us up for long-term success.  So, I am in for the ride. Next year I am celebrating my 25th anniversary with the company and SAP is celebrating its 50th anniversary and I certainly have the appetite for some more years after that, as well.  Thank you very much, Amit and thanks everybody for your interest in SAP.
