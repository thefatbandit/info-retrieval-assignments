[Started Abruptly] … Global Healthcare Conference. And it’s a pleasure to introduce the next presenting speaker. So, first of all, I’m Charles Duncan. I’m a Senior Biotechnology Analyst for Cantor. And I’ve been covering this sector for many years and few times have I ever seen what I’ve seen in the last six months and so it’s very exciting. Should you live in exciting times. It’s interesting to introduce the next presenting company, which is Novavax, ticker symbol is NVAX. I reiterate -- I cover this stock with an overweight rating and a $211 price target. And it’s a pleasure to introduce senior management from Novavax, Mr. Stan Erck, the company’s CEO; and Dr. Greg Glenn, the company’s Chief Scientific Officer. Thank you, gentlemen, for joining us. Hello.Great. How are you doing? Doing very well. Interesting times you’ve been living in. I can’t believe you could take the half an hour out of your very busy schedules to talk to me today. But I very much appreciate it. So, Novavax is in, already had a very interesting year with some clinical data out of their NanoFlu program earlier this year and then we were all COVIDified. And so, I guess, I’m wondering if you could just give us a perspective on your view of, why the company exists and should these be quite interesting times for you? Yeah. That’s great. So why does this company exist? So I think as everybody knows we’re a vaccine company. We’ve been developing a platform of vaccines that have -- has pushed us toward being a respiratory vaccine company. We have vaccines for RSV, respiratory syncytial virus that cause of hospitalization of newborns in the U.S. We have a flu vaccine. If COVID didn’t come around, we would be have the most exciting year we’ve had with that data from a pivotal Phase III flu trial, where the goal is to use our nanoparticle vaccine that’s adjuvant with Matrix and to have a better flu vaccine than any vaccine that’s out there. And so we’ve been going for the last several years head to head against various vaccines, the most popular marketed vaccines, Fluzone High-Dose. And we’ve shown consistently in Phase I, Phase II and now a Phase III trial that we have, potentially the world’s best flu vaccine and we have pivotal data that with accelerated approval process that we can use our clinical data to file for BLA in the coming years. And so we’re excited about that, but of course, everything has become overwhelmed by our newest respiratory vaccine, which is just Coronavirus. And so why is the company here? Well, we make vaccines against viruses and against emerging infectious viruses. And in some sense we’ve been practicing for this pandemic for the last decade. This is our third Coronavirus vaccine. We did SARS, we did MERS, which showed remarkable potency and safety in those vaccines. And now we have turned toward and focus the entire company on COVID-19. And so we have demonstrated in mice, we have demonstrated in non-human primates and now in people, the ability to have our vaccine safely administered and stimulate very potent neutralizing antibodies, very potent T-cell antibodies, very potent -- with very potent -- very safe immune responses. And finally, importantly, we have a vaccine which is very stable and being produced and distributed at refrigerated temperatures and at large volumes. And I think -- and we announced today the -- what our global strategy for manufacturing is that we’ve assembled over the past six months, including today’s announcement. So we partnered with the largest by volume vaccine company in the world Serum Institute and now between Serum Institute and the production facilities we have already established in Europe, in United States and in Asia that we are prepared next year to be able to produce at a level of an excess of 2 billion doses of our vaccines. So that’s where Novavax is right now. It’s exciting year so far and with no letter from sight. It has been an unbelievable year of productivity for you folks, not only in terms of the pipeline, but also in terms of business development. And Stan, you alluded to this towards the end of your comments with regard to manufacturing. But you’ve had to do a lot to fund the development of the COVID vaccine and to ensure access, because it seems to me that you have, if not the best, you have certainly a competitive vaccine with regard to its efficacy and tolerability profile. And I imagine that a lot of people, not only in the United States, but elsewhere are going to have -- are going to want to have access to it. So if you could just help us understand the manufacturing process and your capacity, you mentioned 2 billion. Are you going to be able to produce and distribute a COVID vaccine worldwide in a year? Well, I mean, of course, it’s a great question and we are a biotech company without licensed product at this point. Having said that, process -- the manufacturing process we have which is a platform that we’ve been using. It’s the same. It’s a very similar production process to what we’ve used in the Phase III flu trial and we also use it to make ebola vaccine and other Coronavirus vaccine. So it’s a straightforward process where we’re using insect cell manufacturing system to make a recombinant protein. And we simply purify that protein and when we purify it, process we use results in the nanoparticle, which is very immunogenic, provides -- stimulates broad antibody responses. Then we mix that with a -- with an Agilent, with something called Matrix-M, which is opponent based Agilent from a company that we acquired six years ago, which is demonstrated very robust ability to broaden immune response, heightened immune response and in a very safe fashion. So it’s simply formulate and fill that. So what we’re doing is unprecedented, is we are now -- we’ve now got seven manufacturing sites in seven different companies globally that allows us to, we track transfer, same process to all seven plants at the same time and I don’t believe that anybody’s ever tried to do that before, but this is a pandemic life that we live in. We’ve developed comparability, very robust comparability assays that allow us to say, in each of these plants, when we make product that will be exactly the same from a regulatory point of view. And so that’s how we’re able to do it. So -- and distribution, recently we partnered with Serum, as they distribute over a billion doses annually to all of the low and middle income countries of the world. We can’t do that. They can… Now should this… … system and the regulatory system they work with… Now should this… The biggest supplier, the global alliance for vaccines and so that’s a package that we put together, that’s very important all these, not just their capacity to manufacture, but to distribute and use of regulatory. In the high income countries where we retain the rights, we’re partnered with the Operation Warp Speed and with -- and we will partner with other countries -- with countries who bid for product and there the distribution is not -- is complicated for us. We have to get it to a central distribution site and so we manufacture and get into a central distribution site. And in the U.S. people like CDC and ACIP and an HHS are going to work out the details of distribution. So I think we can -- we’ve set up a global system. This is a global problem. It’s not just the U.S. It’s a global problem. It’s only solved with the global vaccine. Well, and we were impressed with your initiatives with the Serum Institute of India, frankly, and being able to enable access to low and middle income countries. We didn’t see that out of a lot of the other players, at least as an early strategy and so my hat’s off to you on that initiative. Yeah. Maybe if we could talk a little bit about the ongoing clinical development of the SARS-COVID-2 vaccine candidate. You call it NVX-CoV2373. I’m going to shorten it to 2373, if you don’t mind and just maybe bring Dr. Glenn into talk about this. There’s an ongoing Phase IIb in the U.S. and Australia, as well as South Africa. And I’m wondering if you could help us understand really the nature of that study and why it’s being conducted? Well, first of all, no surprise, you don’t like our name, NVX-CoV2373. It’s really a mouthful, isn’t it? So we’re working on it. But, yeah, it’s been exciting time, as you probably know well we published our first trial results in the New England Journal a couple weeks ago. And that’s, of course, the peer review process where we’re gratified by the receipt of that. I think it’s been a very important study. And that data was reviewed by the FDA, as a precursor for us moving on into the next stage of development. So -- and pretty much what you see in the paper is what they were able to review. So they gave us the thumbs up, that allowed us to move into the Phase II trial in the U.S. and Australia. So what we’re trying to -- what we’re achieving there is to expand the safety database in the over 60-year-old population. And so, the key sort of the -- this all the data will be helpful. It will all go into the package -- our safety package about the product. But the key portions of that group have been recruited because they’re going to trigger our ability to start the Phase III trial. Okay. So we won’t show interim data. I don’t think we’ve decided whether we’re going to have a data review on that, but we will show the interim data to the FDA. And in assuming that looks like we did in Phase I, it looks good, that will trigger the start of the U.S. Phase III and we’re projecting that will be in October, probably, mid-October. So imagine to do that we’ve probably got the people recruited and a lot of that underway. So that’s going very well. What also was triggered by the New England Journal data, if I may call it, was the start of the efficacy study in South Africa. So this is a full blown efficacy study and we went there because it’s a good shot on goal in the sense that there’s a high attack rate, obviously, a large unmet need, we felt, we knew investigators there from previous experience, they were very capable. And they came to us and said, look, we can not only do an efficacy study in our setting, but we can also include in there some high risk patients that are HIV positive stable and you’ll need that in your experiment. In U.S., right. So it really was something to build on the Gates Foundation was quite enthusiastic about it. They’re funding major part of that trial. So that’s going well. That started in August. All of our efficacy studies have harmonized primary endpoints. And so the access of the information, the data collection and the analysis will be very common across these trials. And we look at these different opportunities is potentially different ways, all different ways to demonstrate the vaccine -- the vaccines’ efficacy. So that the other trial that was triggered by, hope you’re feeling breathless, like, hey, and these are a lot of trials to stand up in a short period of time. But we -- the New England Journal paper also or data also triggered the start of the work on a Phase III trial in the U.K. That’s going to start shortly in terms of recruiting patients. It’s a large trial. It’s could be a licensure trial for MHRA, which is the U.K. regulators and/or EMA, European, and of course, the data matters for the U.S. So all those are very strong reasons for us to do it. The U.K. has a healthcare structure embedded in a trial network. So they’re very famously good for doing trials and there’s an uptick. So, again, it’s another -- from an efficacy standpoint another very good self goal for us. And then, finally, as I mentioned earlier, we’re shortly to start the Phase III in the U.S., 30,000 subjects, very much aligned with the other U.S. trials that are going, large U.S. trials in terms of endpoint structure, taking advantage of the great work by the -- done by the NIH COVPN network, which is, as this unprecedented collaboration. And the other thing I should mention is, they have a lot of knowledge about the attack rate. And so is -- this is going to help us, because the -- these are event driven trials and so the speed to the answer is going to be proportional to the attack rate and attack rate is certainly going to be informed by what we know from surveillance. And so in U.S…. Yeah. … we have this unprecedent amount of data being processed and so we have a lot of, that’s one of our important tick boxes for where we go is areas we know that there’s high transmission. So it’s geographically different. But we have a really good view of that from the work speed and the NIH COVPN network perspective. So very optimistic that these trials will be operationally completed well and they are really good opportunities to demonstrate efficacy in these different settings. I hope you’re getting some rest right now because soon you’re going to be quite busy reading out trial results. And I want to talk about those results in just a minute and talk about the endpoints and the answer, if you will, that you talk about or that you mentioned. But before I do, I wanted to ask you about this Phase II with the adult population, the older adult population, you mentioned greater than 60 years old, perhaps, even the elderly population. But also does it include patients with specific kind of concerns regarding generalized health status, such as diabetes or cardiovascular health. You did mention that South African study that included a stable HIV patients, so tell me a little bit more about that ongoing Phase II then? In that Phase II that’s more limited. The -- as you know with any one of those conditions are sort of a spectrum of disease. Yeah. So it’s -- these are not -- these are healthy ambulatory patients, who can have a hypertension or diabetes, but very limited. And then as we move into the other populations, I think, you’ll see more population in our safety database with things like hypertension and pre-existing disease. So right now just showing clearly that in that older adult population we have good immunogenicity and safety. In a way we felt that that was well established with flu. But COVID is a little bit of a different beast and so we agreed with the FDA to supply this information as with everyone else. Yeah. I was going to ask you, I mean, is there any mechanistic rationale, you mentioned or you call out the NanoFlu data, but for patients who may be experiencing more immune senescence, i.e. elderly patients, but even maybe adult -- older adult patients, would you anticipate there to be any fall off in terms of the efficacy? That -- no. Actually, I think, there may be a modest fall off in the immunogenicity. But if you had to look at our immunogenicity, I would say, it really shoots well above the mark. So we did have a good experience with flu, NanoFlu with that population. We know that they’re -- they have some immune senescence. And one of the features that we saw in our data, which I think is remarkable, our flu data is that, we took a population that largely had very low CD flow of T-cell help and the Matrix-M are adjuvant and the nanoparticle together seem to be very good at inducing T-cell help. We saw that in our Phase II and then we really robustly saw that again in our Phase III trial for flute. So I think it’s going to be important. I think when you look at our really good neutralizing functional antibody, that’s going to be undergirded by T-health, that’s what drives affinity maturation and therefore the quality of the antibody and just the magnitude, the height of the antibody. So I expect that we’re going to -- I have every reason to expect we’re going to see the same thing, very robust T-cell help. We saw this in the -- in this young adult population in the trial, so I know what will happen and I think it’s going to be important aspect for conferring protective antibodies in older adults. We -- we’ve had some experience with other vaccines. Usually some of the immunogenicity falls off a bit. But when you look at our -- the level of, I think, is the -- it’s so very good that I expect that to have really no fall off with the clinical benefit. Excellent. And so it sounds like we’ll get an early even interim read on that in the next coming weeks or so, because you mentioned the Phase III could start in October. I guess regarding that Phase III, let’s talk about endpoints. But before we do, you mentioned a size of trial being roughly 30,000 patients and I know that that is based on an estimate of the attack rate and that’s what other companies have talked about. However, Pfizer has recently expanded their trial, I believe it’s Pfizer, BioNTech, maybe the other one, but they’re all above the kind of 40,000 level. And so, I guess, my question is, first of all, with these other ongoing studies, do you believe that you’ll have sufficient information from other kind of non-traditional cohorts to be included in the primary Phase III, so that you don’t have to expand or is the expansion of trial size a function of attack rate and then we need to talk about what it means to have an attack, which will bring us into the discussion about endpoints? Look, what we’re behind, but not very far behind. So it’s allowed… Okay. … us to take advantage of the common experience that we’re using the common infrastructure that the precepts, the success criteria, the statistical that interacts with the FDA. We’re worthy -- we’re inheriting a really richly thought through operational and strategic plan here. So that’s a big plus for us, I would say. So, for example, as I was mentioning earlier, there’s a lot of knowledge about incidence of disease. That’s matured in the last two months and so we’re the benefactors of that maturity. Okay. So some of the things you see we have been roiling around about underserved populations, et cetera, we’re well aware of that. I think we’ve really got that in hand and that’s a population that has a high attack rate those populations. So they both serve the purpose of generating good data in those populations to support usage and also for licensure to trial that they’re kind of -- they have those Venn diagrams are really overlapping very nicely. So we -- these numbers are, the FDA gave guidance on success criteria as a lower bound of a constant of 30. So that’s precision and a point estimate of 50%. So you can do the calculation and come up with some estimates around attack rate, and say, look, well, we need about 140 cases. So that’s the issue. So how do you get to the right number of cases based on those presuppositions. Now, what we built into our trials, our interim analyses. So if our vaccine efficacy 50%, we need all 140 endpoints to get to the lower bound 30. We expect our vaccine efficacy will actually be quite good based on your experience. I think neutralizing antibody has been shown definitively to be a marker for what should be protected. So given that, I think, it’s reasonable to expect our vaccine efficacy to be quite high. So we should -- we built into our plan the ability to take an interim look. And then, what I think is especially interesting, we have a overarching data safety monitoring board for these trials. It’s common for the other -- all the other U.S. manufacturers that are testing their vaccine here. And it has two roles, obviously, one is to protect the safety. So they see everything in an unblinded fashion, so all the safety events. You probably know this, there’s going to be assays, some of the assays are related, somebody steps off the curb, it gets hit by a car, that haven’t really grow. Yeah. I had three deaths in one day and it turned out three people have gotten hit in the crosswalk tragically in Mexico City. But it shows up as an assay. So we have got to sort those things out and so that’s very important. Their objective outside the company, monitoring the safety of the trial, but they’re also going to monitor the efficacy. They will look in an unblinded fashion. If they see good efficacy, they can make a recommendation to do that interim analysis, but earlier, based on some reasonable guidelines. So, I think, that’s very favorable to us that we could potentially have an earlier blind -- unblinded event based on good efficacy. So, 140 is out there at the other end. The numbers could be quite a bit smaller, and of course, that’s time, right, that’s time to do the key event of unblind event. Right. So very well thought out again. We could process it from some of the thinking that’s already gone on before us and some tweaks made it appropriate for us. So I’m buoyant. We had the same thing for the Phase III trial in the U.S. We have an interim look. So we have the ability to go back. You know there we don’t have a DSMB, the way it is organized in U.S. We do have a safety monitoring committee. So that same ability to unblind look at safety, et cetera. But we have that built into our U.K. trial as well. So good ways to safely monitor the trials and good ways to statistically, mathematically correct, if all the FDA guidance -- guidelines for definitive proof but opportunities to do that early, especially the vaccines working well. Okay. So let’s talk about that and we only have about five more minutes or less. But it may seem like a naive question, but how will we know if the efficacy is good or working well? What are the key kind of measures that you’ll look to? And I guess, where do you think the greatest value will be? Is it preventing infection? Is it preventing severe disease? Is it shortening the duration of symptom presentation? What do you think is most important thing? Yeah. Those are all important. Is it vaccine developer? Yeah. Yeah. Those are all important. And all that -- there’s a pretty wide swath of data being collected, including asymptomatic. And how do you do that? You draw blood at the end of the trial and look for serologic evidence of seroconversion. Yeah. But really as you know, the critical thing is to prevent clinical disease. And so the primary endpoint is going to be symptomatic and that’s pretty well defined by the FDA. Yeah. So the PCR positive, symptomatic infection with COVID and then we have gradations of that. So, the secondary endpoints are more moderate to severe disease. But I will tell you, the symptomatic disease is what I would consider someone’s relatively sick and those are good, I would say, and then amongst that you have the more severe, now these trials are not big enough to say, test the premise you could prevent death. They’re just not enough events like that. Yeah. But the more severe outcomes, you could -- and you could make a statement on that. So, all of our trials are designed to capture this symptomatic PCR positive disease, as well as the moderate to severe syndromes. Now, in the U.K. and South Africa, those -- that we have options to unblind one of the other as a primary endpoint, which is very interesting. In the U.S., it’s more hierarchical. We will look… Yeah. …for the symptomatic outcomes. And so as a vaccinologists that’s we want to prevent disease. I think our vaccine has a good chance of preventing the symptomatic disease and a very, very good chance of preventing the more modern severe outcomes. Typically, those vaccine efficacy can be quite high, and again, given what we see from our immune responses there is a reasonable expectation that could be very -- a very high, very good result there. Well, we wish you luck and get speed in this endeavor, because certainly important to the world. But also been really interesting to see how rapidly you have responded and leverage your platform. I guess in the last one minute that we have, turning back to Stan, you’ve had to really build a very different organization than the one you contemplated a year ago. Where do you think you’re going to be in a year when we’re together either in person or doing more virtual fireside chats? How do you feel about the next year and what would you like to achieve? Well, we’ve doubled the size of the company in the United States just in the past three months or four months. We’ve -- it’s one of the best parts of my job today is being able to recruit people. We are a company that people really want to come and work for this. This is a lifetime opportunity. We’ve added the whole Czech Republic 150 people there. There will be 300 people within the next year. And so the company has evolved, but it’s evolved from the core of being a really good group of very smart scientific and clinical people who have been developing respiratory vaccines for well over a decade now, just building back upon that. So it’s a lot of fun to do. It’s a lot of work. But the mission is noble, so. It’s exciting. It’s exciting to see the progress and I congratulate you on that. But I also wish you more luck in the future. And so, Greg and Stan, thank you very much for taking time out of your day. I know you’ve got a lot of work to do. So I’m going to let you go. But we look forward to more in the future. Thanks a lot. Yeah. Thanks, Charles. Take care.
