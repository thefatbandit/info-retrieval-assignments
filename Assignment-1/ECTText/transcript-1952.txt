All right. Well, thanks Sidney and thanks again for having us at the conference today. We really appreciate it. And yes, you are right there have been a lot of dynamics in this market, it seems to always be the case and probably worthwhile take a step back and just think about what transpired this year. I mean we've had a pandemic and a global recession, it's created a very unusual set of circumstances. I think our company has done a really good job in terms of managing through the pandemic. We initially have to deal with this in China in January. I think we have done a very good job by keeping our employees safe, keeping our factories up and running and building as much profit as we could in that situation. And I think what's happened then in the industry as our customers got concerned not just about us but about others and availability of products. So we thought an increase in demand in the March quarter and in the June quarter, which we think was attributable to the concerns they had on the supply chain. So now, as they gain confidence in the supply chain as we start to transition to the second half of the calendar year, we are ending up in a situation where particularly on the cloud, on service provider side we are seeing a digestion phase. So we are -- that's the way we guided the September quarter, assuming that would be the case. But I think both OEMs and cloud service providers are in the process of normalizing their inventory and so there is a little less demand in the short-term. We are continuing to do well in retail. We saw retail pick up some momentum in the month of June and continue into July and this quarter is playing out about the way we had expected. In the last two or three weeks, we have actually seen some stabilization in terms of the prices on retail. So we are encouraged by that at least they are not continuing to get worse. And at this point, it's a matter of continuing to focus on what we can control and we have significant product introductions going on both on the enterprise SSD side with flash and on the capacity enterprise side with our 16, 18, and 20 terabyte products. We have a lot going on and we are very excited about the product roadmap we have and as we work our way through this pandemic and get back to normal. We think we will end up in a really strong market position. So, itâ€™s kind of long-winded, but I will stop there and if you other questions Sidney. I think my words worth stabilizing, I wouldn't say pricing is getting better, I would say it's stabilizing. So it's starting to flatten out. And what we have seen in the past and really went through one of these cycles before is that the transactional markets or retail market or commercial distribution market do tend to be a leading indicator. So it's good to see stabilization. I want to make sure we're not saying pricing is getting better. We're just seeing prices stabilize. Well, you've got several questions in there. So first of all, we believe inventory is getting normalized, both within OEMs and within cloud service providers. And on top of that, we are going through significant product transitions that I mentioned with the 16, 18 and 20 terabyte drives -- hard drives and then with the enterprise SSDs. So I think it's hard to point to just one factor. But, we do think things -- we don't know how long this will last. But as we get through this digestion phase, we think we'll be in a much stronger position as we have our industry leading products in the market. Yes. I mean, I really don't want to start giving guidance beyond the September quarter. I mean, this quarter is playing out about the way we anticipated so far. And it will definitely have more to say about the December quarter once we get to the earnings call. Yes. I think overall, our visibility tends to be pretty good. Usually, it's three to six months out. What's unusual right now is, we also have major qualification activity going on with our new hard drives and with our enterprise SSDs. So it's the calls that make it a little more uncertain than normal. So I think that the mix of the business is important and strategically, we talked about this a fair amount. I mean, we've made the decision to under index to the mobile market and that ends up being a bit more of a volatile market than the other markets. We talked already about retail, we tend to be very strong in retail. We're number one market share in most of the markets we participate in there. So, that is a unique characteristic of us. We also, for the first time in the June quarter ended up with number one market share in terms of the client SSD market. So that's a good position. And then, as we've talked about for a couple quarters, I mean, we're in the process of making progress in the enterprise SSD market. We gained a couple points in market share there last quarter. I think that's going to be a bumpy road. And it'll be chunky because you win big pieces of business at a time but I think because of our long-term relationships on the hard drive side, I think we've got a good chance of being successful there just like we were on the client SSD side. So I think we do have a unique mix of business with our partnership with Kioxia, we've got great products, great cost structure, we get good leverage on the R&D side. So I think we've definitely got some unique characteristics. Talking about on the NAND side? Yes. No, I think there we are also going through a little bit of a normalization cycle. But I think in general, it's not too bad. Yes, like you said, I wasn't -- I saw the tail end of the last cycle. And I would say what I've understood is on the hard drive side, we had a lot of customers hitting the brakes simultaneously at the end of 2018. And so that that hit us and others pretty hard all at once. I think this time; we've got different customers doing different things. And then compounding the situation a bit right now, again, as the product introduction activity or the qualification activity we have going on, on the hard drive side. So, I don't know how this is going to ultimately end up comparing with what we had back in the 2018 timeframe. I do think there's some similarities in the sense that in the first half of this year, we ended up shipping well above the traditional compound annual growth rate of 35%. I think that was really induced by the pandemic, but we got above the normal growth curve. And so now we're going through an adjustment phase as a result of that. So I don't know how long this will last. But it's just like we got to the last cycle, we'll get through this cycle fine. And when we come out of this cycle, as I mentioned, I expect us to have industry leading products. So that'll be good. And then the flash side, we have this theory and we'll see how it plays out that in the 3D era that the cycles will be less severe than they were before. The products are more capital intensive. And so all of us have to be more cautious in terms of the supply that we put into place. And I think, in general, the industry is being pretty cautious. We're being pretty cautious. We're expecting supply growth somewhere in the range of 25% to 30% this year, and we expect to grow our supply in line with them. Yes. I don't know. I mean, I would just -- all I can do really is repeat what I said. I think there are two factors. One is that shipments were above the long-term trend line. So that's part of it. And then secondly, we're in the midst of product qualification and we're ramping, important new products. So, that may be why it looks more severe than other areas. Yes, so several questions in there. And first of all, Huawei, we've said before, is an important customer for us. They're well below being a 10% customer, but they're still important. And we have been selling all of our products to them. In other words, both our flash and our hard drive portfolios have been selling into Huawei. And we've been managing that business carefully. We've been fully complying with the law. When the new regulations came out, we thought it was immediately very clear that it impacted all semiconductors. And we still believe that's the case and therefore we don't think any other flash vendors will be selling flash into Huawei. On the hard drive side, it's a little more complex. Again, the regulations are if you have United States intellectual property, or U.S. equipment, you're not supposed to use that for products that you're selling into Huawei. So we're in the process of doing a very detailed analysis on everything we use in our hard drive products, to understand whether we do have to fully comply with the regulation. In the interim, we have decided to pause and we're not shipping hard drives to Huawei. And we'll just keep working on our own analysis. And then, simultaneously, and I think one of your other questions was regarding a license. And we have already applied for a license to ship both our flash products and our hard drive products to Huawei. We don't know exactly what the process or the timeline looks like, but we've got our applications in and we'll obviously do whatever we can to get clarification as quickly as possible. No. I mean, we really did ship up until the deadline, which I believe was yesterday. And, and so, there definitely was demand from Huawei. I don't think there was any extraordinary surge in demand, but we did try to get whatever we had underway, shipped to them. So I think we did that successfully. One of the things we have to do now is understand where our customers who used to buy product from Huawei going to be buying it from in the future. And so we need to understand where that business is going. And then presumably, we've already got relationships with those OEMs and we'll be able to provide more product to them. But that's what we need to keep working on. In the end, we don't think people are going to start using less storage. I just think they're going to be buying it in different places. And we need to make sure we're there to help fulfill that demand. Yes. So I mean, it's been a very disruptive year, as I mentioned before, from a supply chain perspective, and we're really pleased with how our team has worked through the challenges. The health and safety of our employees was the number one priority and I think that's gone really well. We put a lot of additional procedures in place in terms like cleaning and disinfecting all of our sites, they ensure a safe environment we do a lot more screening as employees enter the sites and then we do physical distancing, face coverings, all those kinds of things. So we put a lot of extra measures in terms of protecting our people and our supply chain. We'll continue to be vigilant in terms of making sure as much as we can, we have second sources for parts, and we rebuild our supply chain, get our inventory buffers back to where we want them to be. But at this point in time, I think we're essentially back to normal. It's just in this sort of pandemic environment you never know where you might get surprised by the virus. Yes. So in the June quarter, I mean, we announced we had $96 million in COVID-19 related costs, and almost all of that was attributable to the hard drive side of the business. And part of that was related to the month of April where we had one of our factories that we were not able to fully utilize. So from the June quarter, we think things are going to get better and you're right on the logistics side, we think there's going to be ongoing headwind. The reality is that there are far fewer commercial flights coming out of Asia and so there's less cargo capacity from an air standpoint. And so we've seen air freight rates go up quite a bit. At the same time, given that we were trying to get our supply chain back in order we've seen more air freight than we typically would use. So we got hit a couple of different ways there. So I think the logistics costs will be elevated at least for a couple more quarters. And then the other costs that of course, are incremental are all the safety and disinfection and equipment costs we have associated with keeping our people safe. That'll continue for until it's not necessary but for the foreseeable future. So, I think things will get better from a cost standpoint, but it's not going to go back to zero anytime soon. Yes. So on the hard drive side, we're still going through the analysis. We have paused shipping to Huawei so we're currently not shipping to Huawei for hard drives. And we're going through the analysis to make sure that we can -- if we restart shipping that we're fully compliant with the law. And then simultaneously, like I mentioned before, we've applied for a license for both the flash and the hard drive product families. Yes. So I don't know that it'll have a direct impact in terms of the inventory situation. I mean the reality is there will be other vendors trying to pick up the business that Huawei used to have and so they'll be ordering inventory. And I don't know that we can point to Huawei as extending out the current normalization process. Yes. I think it's been a fantastic success and maybe the longest JV in the industry. I don't know if that's true for sure. But been working together for over 20 years and our teams work very closely together, at all levels. There are big benefits to both Kioxia and us from the partnership. One of them, of course, is economies of scale, we get out of manufacturing, but we also get significant economies of scale on R&D, and it may be something you'll see if we can comment on in a couple of minutes. Then there's a lot of value in the partnership in terms of driving technology forward. So we think we're able to get better products together by making sure that we challenge each other and we make sure we make the right technical decisions. Overall, we're very optimistic about Kioxia becoming public. We think it's a great company, great assets, great scale. And I think it will help people understand our company better and understand how strong that relationship is. I don't think there's going to be any impact on operations, as I said, I mean, we've been working together for 20 plus years. We're really happy for Kioxia that they're going to be going public. This has been their goal and we want them to achieve their goal. And we think we'll continue to work very effectively with them going forward. Yes. I think from a flash technology standpoint, we both contribute to the R&D, we both provide capital for the manufacturing. And we both take the raw wafers out of the fab. From a go-to-market standpoint, I think our mix of business is very different. Our productization is very different in terms of which products we take. From our standpoint, we have a really strong retail brand. And we're going to continue to take advantage of that. We've been very successful in terms of the client SSD market, as I mentioned, we have number one market share their last quarter, and we're really making good progress in terms of enterprise SSD with our NVMe products. So we're not as big in the mobile market and that's by choice, we've chosen to under index there. And so I think there are a lot of benefits to both Kioxia and us from working together and then we go-to-market, the way we think makes the most sense for each of our companies. Yes. So, you're right, Sidney, we did guide our margins down for the coming quarter. And we do have headwind on both the flash side and the hard drive side of the business. On the flash side, I would say most of it is attributable to pricing. And we've seen a lot of pricing pressure this quarter. Don't know again, how long that's going to last or encouraged by what we're seeing on retail. But that's really the main driver in terms of flash gross margins. The second driver is one I think you already asked about, which is our costs on K1. And that's our new facility and we're in the process of ramping our production there. But we have the building and all the equipment in place, but we're not up to normal production levels. And so we've got some period expense to the tune of about $80 million that we're going to experience this quarter. We think this will probably be the peak, and then we'll start to see it come down fairly quickly over the next couple of quarters. So that's the headwind, we're primarily seeing on the flash side. On the hard drive side, it's a combination of factors. I think we've touched on those as well, where we're really seeing customers, both OEMs and the cloud service providers normalizing their inventory levels. And simultaneously, we're in the process of ramping our new 16 and 18 terabyte products. And as a result of that, we're in the early stages of getting up the learning curve and getting up the yield curves on the hard drives at the same time we're not shipping as many products, and we're not able to leverage our volumes over our fixed costs as much as we would like to be able to. So that's one of the key headwinds. And then, the other thing we touched on is the COVID costs are not going away. They'll be better this quarter and primarily be logistics and then basic operational costs but we're still going to have some pressure there. So in the short-term, we're definitely seeing some margin pressure. As we come through this, as I mentioned before, we're pretty excited because we think we'll have industry leading products on both sides of the business. And we should as we work our way up the yield curve on the hard drive side, we should see some good improvement in terms of gross margins. Yes. So I'll start there. I mean, the debt covenants were never a concern and a driver for suspending the dividend. It was really about prioritizing the way we use our capital. And the first priority when we have a dividend and after we suspended, it has always been to reinvest in the business. So we want to endorse the R&D, and we want to endorse the CapEx to make sure that we can grow our product lines to stay very competitive in the marketplace. That'll always be the first priority. And then, our second priority now is clearly to deliver the company. And we have a goal of getting to $6 billion in gross debt and $3 billion in net debt. And we derive those because we looked at growth levers through the cycle. And if you looked at our peak EBITDA in FY'18, on a trailing 12-month basis, it was about $6.3 billion. And if you look at the worst, trailing 12-month EBITDA in the last couple of years, it's been about $1.7 billion. And so if you back into the growth leverage, it means you have growth leverage anywhere from a little bit less than 1 up to 3.5. And we think that that's the right kind of capital structure to have in place for the cyclical business that we have. So that's how we derive the goal, how quickly we get to the $6 billion in gross debt is not clear, but we're definitely committed to making progress as quickly as we can.Okay. Thanks Sidney. Just very quickly here, we will be making forward-looking statements and I ask you to please refer to our SEC filings for the risk associated with these statements. We will also be making references to non-GAAP financials and a reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found on our Web site. Let me turn the mic back to you Sidney.Great. Good afternoon everyone. I'm Sidney Ho, I cover semiconductors and semi-cap equipment at Deutsche Bank. The next company we have in the fireside chat is, Western Digital. Western Digital supplies both hard disk drives and flash memory. Clearly, there is a lot of demand for storage in the digital world. And Western Digital is agnostic, where the data is saved in hard drives or flash memory, but it looks like both markets are facing some short-term headwinds which will get into shortly. Today, we are very pleased to have Bob Eulau, Western Digital's CFO, as well as Siva Sivaram, President of Technology and Strategy with us. Welcome Bob and Siva. Before we start for those investors who are listening to the Webcast through our portal, if you want to ask a question, there is a box on the left-hand side of your screen where you can type in your question. I will ask the question as we go through our discussion. And before we move on, I'll hand it over to Peter for some pretty important disclosures. Go ahead Peter. All right. Well, Bob, maybe I will start with you. Again, welcome to the conference. Let's start with some near-term dynamics. Can you give us an overview of the business and the market conditions you saw in fiscal Q4, which is calendar Q2 as well as your expectation in the September quarter, maybe you can separately talk about hard drives and flash memory and more importantly have you seen any part of either business stabilizing or improving since your earnings call. Yes. Sure. Maybe just a follow-up on that not just the comment on the retail pricing getting better in the last two or three weeks. Is that on the flash side, is it on the hard drive side and how indicative is that for your retail business for the rest -- the other businesses that could be -- is it usually just follows it or its kind of independent of each other. Got it. Okay. Maybe drilling into the hard disk drive market a little bit. If I read your comments from your earnings call correctly, you're pointing towards a weakness in both enterprise and cloud service providers. Maybe can you elaborate a little bit more whether the weakness is broad based or is it focused more on certain type of customers', certain regions and related to that do you get a sense that this is mainly inventory digestion that you talked about? Or is that some sort of equation factors related to maybe capacity transitions people kind of pausing right now waiting for the next transition to happen? Great. I think last week, some of the OEMs talked about they saw demand stabilizing in August, that was mentioned in one of the investor conference. And they see growth potential in September in calendar Q4. Are you seeing similar trends or you still seeing kind of bouncing around the bottom? Okay. That's fair. One more question, hard drive. How would you characterize your visibility into the near line market or business compared to maybe a normal environment at this time of the year? I really thought your visibility in general is pretty good, just because these drives have long lead times. And some of the orders could be quite sizable. Got it. Maybe switching gears over to the main side, the main memory pricing environment has appeared to worsened since the second quarter. And you talk about some of these headwinds on the last earnings call. You did talk about retail pricing stabilizing, and hopefully it's a leading indicator. Are there any drivers that are unique to Western Digital that will make your ASP better or worse than the overall market, I'm thinking about maybe game consoles, maybe enterprise SSDs those kinds of things. Great. Staying with the main side, there has been increasing concerns about inventory levels in various end markets. From your point of view, what do you think about the overall health of the inventory levels at your customers or in the supply chain at this time? NAND specifically, correct? Okay. This is more a high level view. And I understand that you have gone through only one cycle as you mentioned earlier, but we have seen cycles in both hard drives and flash memory in the past just a couple of years, right? How do you think this current cycle will compare to those previous cycles? And what evidence do you see to support that kind of assessment? Great. Before we move on to the next section, I have one incoming question. Why is the digestion phase for hard drives seem to be more pronounced than other segments from the data center market? Call it a DRAM side, a new processor side, it seems like hard drive is getting hit a little hard than the rest of the supply chain. Is there a reason for that? Okay. Let me switching gears to few questions that I asked every company here at the conference. The first one is Huawei. It's very topical, given the new restrictions that were announced last month, but also the 120 days' grace period. It's also up this month. A few questions here, one, can you give us an update how you think those restrictions will impact Western Digital in the short term, when I say short term, second half of this year is what Iâ€™m thinking, and maybe also in the longer term? And have you applied for license to ship to Huawei and is license needed for both flash memory and hard drives? Great. And one more before we move on to next one, but specifically related to short-term, have you seen any kind of celebration to Huawei business just to beat the deadline or you've been? You've been not shipping it them for a while now? Got it. I'll move on to the next question, which is kind of COVID-related impacts on the supply chain. So as it relates to COVID, it appears that the supply chain issues has improved. Can you talk a little bit about the state of your supply chain? And are there any bottleneck within your supply chain or your customer supply chain that you would highlight and maybe a concern in the near future? Great. And then, one more on COVID. Can you talk about maybe high operating costs? I think other companies are talking about higher logistics costs. Can you remind us what impact that you're expecting for the September quarter and maybe you can talk about December quarter if you can? And how did you think -- how quickly do you think those costs will come down? I'll stop there. Okay. There are two questions coming in. So I just want to read them out. The first one is while it seems like you need a license to ship NAND to customers in China, is this the same with hard drive? Or is there a way to ship without a license? I think you kind of answered before, but just want to clarify that. Great. And the second question is, if you are not allowed to sell to Huawei, will that prolong the inventory correction that we've been seeing recently, assuming all else being equal. Okay. Maybe moving on Kioxia. Now that Kioxia's IPO is scheduled for next month, we've been getting interest from investors how Western Digital could be different than Kioxia since the two companies are manufacturing partners as far back as I can remember. Maybe Bob, can you please give us an overview of the joint venture and why it has worked for Western Digital and Kioxia for so long? One question that comes up a lot is, when Kioxia goes public, is there any kind of impact on the operations of the joint venture? Right. Maybe last question on Kioxia, at a very, very high level, shouldn't we view Kioxia's flash business as a comfortable business for Western Digital flash business? I don't know a lot of people ask about the difference between the two basically two businesses. Okay. Maybe I'll switch over some technology questions for you, Siva. I saved these questions for you. So I understand that join Western Digital and Kioxia's roadmap is slightly different in the upcoming node BiCS5 is like 112 layers when everyone else is doing 128 does that imply any advantage or disadvantage for you guys versus others? That's great. Maybe to further out beyond the BiCS5x, if you look at the NAND technology roadmap, how far can we scale this NAND technology and one of the levers you can pull to scale the 20 NAND. Great. Siva, I know you from your prior position in SanDisk, but you are now also responsible for hard drives development. Do you see any synergies having both hard drives and flash from a technology perspective? And what gets you most excited about the opportunities in the hard drive business? Excellent, excellent. For the remaining few minutes, maybe I'll switch it back to the financial side for Bob. On the gross margin side guidance, you have guided to gross margin down for your fiscal first quarter -- September quarter in the 25% to 27% range. What are the puts and takes you're seeing here on the flash and hard drive side and where are you seeing the most uncertainty and then pass a short-term headwinds, how you think about gross margins long-term? Thanks. Maybe one last question, you suspended your dividend in April to focus on paying down debt and you pay down actually an additional $150 million in July. Remind us what are the target levels you want to get to and how quickly you expect to pay down debt before you look at dividends again. And I know earlier in the year a lot of investors asked about debt covenant. I don't know if that is one of the reasons why you decide not to pay the dividends.Interesting question. Both Kioxia and us very, very actively close to evaluate, just like Bob was saying. We both look at the market together so that we can make technology decisions that meet our customer needs. The number of layers is often misquoted. We consistently say when we say 112 layers, we say 112 active layers. Other people add their dummy layers below and above the layers to add to the overall layers. That's number one. But the number of layers has always been slightly different for different manufacturers. When we were doing 64 layers, somebody else was doing 72 layers. When we do 96 layers, somebody else was doing 92 layers. Having said all that, what really matters is how much cost reduction you can get out from node-to-node, how much bit growth you can get from node-to-node, and how you can accomplish both of this with the least amount of capital investment. And this equation is fairly specific to each of us. For us 112 layers is the most capital efficient way of achieving our long-term cost reduction goals. We think the way we have implemented it, we've been able to now start ramping in production, the eels are coming out very well. So this is going to be a big competitive advantage to the Kioxia WDC combination with the 112 layer technology BiCS5 that we are now ramping. It is. Those of us who have been watching this, we have also been amazed at how fast this has moved. In the beginning of the decade, we always thought that NAND could not scale anymore in 2D NAND and that 15 nanometer we actually hit a wall on how to scale. But in the time period since we have done 48 layer, 64 layer, 96 layer, now we have 112 layers. And we don't see a limit to the number of layers that we're going to see for the next five years or so that's more visibility than we have ever seen in any of our semiconductor technologies. But even more important than the number of layers is the overall bit growth and cost reduction that you achieve, the scaling you achieve. And you do that by the X scaling, Y scaling meaning on the lateral dimensions and multiply by the number of layers. And then of course, the logical scaling of three and four bits per cell et cetera. The combination of this is what is consistently giving Western Digital, its scaling path for the next 5, 6, 7 years, we see a good, consistent cost reduction scaling back. I'm glad that you asked me that question Sidney. Clearly when we came from SanDisk, we were all solid state oriented and we wanted to make sure we had the best solid state technology only. Now when we come into the combine Western Digital with both hard drive and flash, there are some very, very key synergies that are obvious. For example, Bob talked about our number one market position with client SSD. In SanDisk, we were struggling at the 6%, 7%, 8%, 10% market share. The reason we could get so rapidly to the number one market share position is because of the customer qualification synergy. How do we meet the customer needs? Hard drives have been qualified in PCs and client devices for decades now, to be able to leverage on that to go do solid state drives, were very quickly able to qualify with our OEM partners that's on the customer side. Similarly, on the enterprise SSD between our cloud customers and OEM customers on the qualification methodology, the [qual] [ph] needs, the product needs. They are very, very analogous. But the most interesting one that we see is our ability to have flash technology inside the HDD, so the next generation of our energy assisted HDD drives will actually have a significant amount of flash built in not as a hybrid drive, but actually to control some of the HDD functions that give improved areal density by putting flash to handle all the metadata and meta information to be inside. These kinds of synergies, for example, in error checking and correction in fault tolerance in terms of qualification leads, in algorithms for recording, in terms of operating system synergies there is a lot that the two sides of the company have learning from each other. That is substantive technology synergy between both hard drive and flash. Q - Sidney Ho Great. I think we're out of time. Thank you for your time, Bob and Siva, and enjoy the rest of the day. All right, thanks a lot Sidney. Take care. Bye-bye.
