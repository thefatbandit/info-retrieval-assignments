Yes. Thanks for having me, Rishi. It's a super weird backdrop in the background here with the fires and the smoke and all that stuff. Likewise. Yes. Rishi, we really view ourselves as a customer engagement company, and we view that space through the lens of communications. And so, I'll give you maybe a few examples, which I think probably illustrates it best. So, there are simple things from a communications perspective, like a notification that you would be used to getting. If, for example, you're a customer of DoorDash, right, your food is being delivered at the specific point in time, the driver is on their way, et cetera. And so, we power communications of that nature. And then, if you kind of move from there from like simple notifications all the way through all sorts of different kind of comms that you might receive from companies that you care about, there's things like Flex, for example, which I'm sure we'll talk about later, that enable contact centers. And so, now, you're talking about kind of a direct, person-to-person experience between contact center agents and consumers and using technology and our communications stack to be able to power things like that. And so, there again, if you think about a customer like a Southwest Airlines, for example, that's using us to power parts of their internal contact center usage. And then finally, and probably more recently, and I'm sure we'll talk about COVID dynamics in a moment, if you consider like some more recent use cases in health care, for example. We've seen a lot of activation around video. It's still relatively small in terms of Twilio revenues, but it is a very fast-growing segment. And if you consider an example like an Epic where they have like an in-app communications that they use us for where you're able to access medical records as well as schedule an appointment with a physician. So, if you kind of consider all of the different aspects of the communications stack, that's the way that we view ourselves, as enabling our customers to engage with their consumers.All right. Good afternoon, everyone, or I guess, still morning, if you're West Coast like I am. But, you can't tell by looking outside. Let's go ahead and get started. My name is Rishi Jaluria. I cover software here at D.A. Davidson. I'm delighted to have with me from Twilio CFO, Khozema Shipchandler. Any investors that would like to ask questions, please either submit to the chat function, I'll be monitoring that the entire time, or feel free to email me directly, rjaluria@dadco.com. With that, Khozema, thank you so much for being with us today. It's a crazy time. I'm hopeful you're staying safe out there. Let's start just kind of briefly. I think, people know a little high level about Twilio, but there's obviously a lot that's changed in the business, even since you've taken over as CFO, especially with the SendGrid integration and some of the new products. So, maybe just like a two-minute overview, and then we can dive into some deeper questions. Yes. So, let's jump straight into COVID because that's obviously top of mind for software investors. Some of the headwinds and tailwinds that you're seeing. I know early in the pandemic, there was concern that Uber and Lyft and Airbnb really hurt you. And clearly, that hasn't turned out to be the case, right? It's really been a case where all the tailwinds are massively out with the headwinds. Maybe just talk about what you're seeing, and what's gone right over the past six months that you've been able to execute and perform so well? [Technical Difficulty] All right. Bear with us a second. It looks like Khozema may have lost the connection. One second, please. Hey, Rishi. Sorry about that. No problem. Are you also on Comcast and getting care services from them? I do use Xfinity. I don't know. Sorry. If it drops again, I'll dial in. Okay. No, no worries. I appreciate that. All right. So, I think we're talking kind of COVID headwinds and tailwinds and the context. So, maybe pick back up... Sure. So, I would say probably one of the most misunderstood areas about the business as we headed into COVID was what I think some investors thought might be a disproportionate impact around things like travel, hospitality and rideshare. And when you look at it, those revenues that ended up being impacted a little bit on the downside, that's less than 10% of our revenues. And so, we didn't feel quite the bite in terms of what we were seeing. And in fact, even without contributions from that part of the business, we were already seeing really high net expansion rates in the vast majority of the rest of the business. And so, kind of pre-COVID, we were already set up for what we thought at the time was a pretty good picture, at least back in Q1. And as we've looked out, having recorded now Q1 and recorded a Q2, I think what we've also seen is a kind of more-than-offset positive in terms of COVID dynamics with an uptake in use cases in particular around health care, around e-commerce, we've seen some stuff in education that obviously took a little bit of a summer lull but has really reactivated recently with kids back in school, and even in philanthropy. And so, I would say on balance, we've seen kind of a net positive as a result of COVID dynamics. There's also some stuff around the fringes in terms of like contact tracing and the like. And my perspective on it is, is that what I feel pretty bullish about longer term in terms of the future of Twilio is that the resilience in these use cases that are newer, I think, is going to be pretty high. And I think it's very unlikely that folks like you and I go backwards in terms of the interactions that we have with a physician or with a retailer or with a supermarket, for example. It just becomes so convenient, and the ROI of both the communications as well as the underlying services is really, really high. And then similarly, I do think, rideshare and hospitality is going to come back at some point. I mean, we're already seeing some green shoots in travel and hospitality. You've seen some companies that have revealed that their bookings have really started to pick up. I think, probably airlines, there's still a little bit of a lag there. But, we think that, that's going to come back over time as well. And so that should provide a little bit of a tailwind. But long story short, I would say a little bit of a net positive. But, I think based on what we're seeing, we feel more positive than ever about the long-term dynamics of the business based on that. That's great. So, I think building on that, I mean, one of the most impressive stats that I think we heard was on the Q2 earnings call, right, where Jeff said customers have accelerated their digital communications strategies by, correct me if I'm wrong, six years on average, which is a really incredible stat. Can you speak a little bit more to these findings, and I think to a point you were saying, right, where you feel we're not going back, how sustainable do you view all these shifts in behavior overall? I think, it's very sustainable. I mean, I think, the reality is, is that COVID coincidentally hit around the time when there was already a longer term secular trend with respect to digital transformation. And if you consider some of the industries that have been impacted maybe more sharply, like in education, like a health care, I mean, these are industries that for the longest time wanted to digitally transform. They didn't really have like an impetus, didn't have a mechanism in the boardroom, if you will, to free up budgets. And then, all of a sudden, COVID hits. We're all working from home. We're all trying to figure out like how to collaborate with one another, get into video conferencing and the like. And it turns out that communications tools and customer engagement tools happen to be in the sweet spot of exactly what our customers needed, and they needed it basically overnight, right? So, you saw a lot of these things just turn on basically immediately. Just think about like the dynamics around contact centers and Flex. If you were running an on-prem contact center agent shop, you basically went from a world in which you had people working in an office in an on-prem world that essentially overnight had to move over to the cloud, had to work collaboratively from home. Companies had [Technical Difficulty] our customers had to keep engaging with their consumers. And so, we just think it's a very high resilience environment in terms of what's happened. And I think when Jeff talks about the six years, which is based on a study that we did, what we found was that all of these long pronounced cycles in terms of budgeting and activating your company to get behind a digital transformation program, all that went away and the urgency behind some of this decision-making really took hold. And on top of that, I mean, all of these cloud-based tools, both in terms of the agility, leveraging our usage-based model really fast and inexpensive starts with a very high ROI. And as our customers have continued to grow, they're able to do so at a very economical price point, while we're still able to make a buck from that. I want to go into some of these newer use cases, and then we can dive into Flex. I know that's obviously super top of mind. But some of these new use cases that you've seen, right, like telehealth obviously, a huge one, education. I think the calling out of contact tracing and then how you're helping on that side is really fascinating. Maybe can you briefly speak a little bit to how you specifically are enabling some of those use cases? And I think, specifically with telehealth, what are some of the investments that you're making on the video side to really kind of be differentiated there? Yes. Rishi, as you know, I mean, we've had a video product for a long time. And it's kind of always been a relatively small product for us, somewhat dormant, and we've been actively selling it. But I think what we found was that when COVID hit, there was a massive pull from many of our customers. And what they were basically telling us is that hey, look, I've got this experience that I drive through my website. I don't really want my customers to leave my environment and then join from someplace else. What I would like is an API that allows my consumers within the context of my approximately or my website to be able to have one seamless experience all in the context of like an Epic or all in the context of a Zocdoc. And our customers are finding that that drives a much more seamless experience for their consumers. All of their records and all of their interactions with their physicians can be accessed in one spot. And so, I think that's like the first place that it's gotten cracked open, and that's been really exciting. We were talking about Comcast a second ago. The reality is it's difficult for them to send their technicians on site, right? So, now, they can do that using a video API, right? And again, having the ability for a consumer to interact with a call center agent potentially, using a bot or actually through a digital contact center, being able to interact with a website and interact with a service technician who can diagnose your problem remotely but through video is incredibly powerful and very high ROIs from that perspective as well. So, I think we'll see where it goes. Like we're not trying to compete with the likes of the technology that we're using right now, obviously, to host the call. But, we do think there's a lot of open field running in the context of this in-app experience just based on the fact that consumers want something that's seamless. Then some of the others that you mentioned, for example contact tracing, we have the underlying comms, for example, that power of the contact tracing. We're not doing the contact tracing ourselves, clearly. But for 15 to 30 localities around the country, they are very actively using our communications technology to enable contact tracing efforts. We're certainly super happy to be able to do it. I mean, it's one of these things where commerce kind of meets philanthropy and there's a sweet spot there for us. And so, I think that's going to be highly resilient as well, as we go. Maybe not contact tracing per se, but other interactions like that that we're able to drive for our customers and their consumers. All right, let's jump into Flex. Obviously, I think with COVID, private call centers are probably never going to be an option again. And we're seeing the entire CCaaS space doing really well, including some of the inContacts and Five9s of the world. You've also seen a big kind of uptick in adoption from what I can tell. Where are you seeing that? And, maybe where are we in terms from a product perspective in terms of feature parity to accelerate that migration from, like you said, the legacy on-premise solutions like Cisco and Avaya to a next-gen solution, I guess? Yes. That's a good question. So, I would start by saying you probably saw the press release this morning where we announced Deloitte as a GSI. So for example, it's pretty important for us to be able to attract a partner with that kind of clout in the marketplace that can now work with us. And I think that is some level of validation that the kinds of features and functionality that we have not just with Flex but our other products and services have reached a point where a notable GSI [Technical Difficulty] So many issues. Clearly, that's a problem there, but we'll keep going. So, I think you were talking about Deloitte and what it's like to have a GSI and… Yes. So, it's obviously great to be able to sign up a GSI like that. And I think, it is some level of validation that features and functionality are kind of getting there in terms of what one of the big guys would really expect. I think, it's one of these things where we're never going to be done. I mean obviously, there is like still a fair amount of work to do to be able to catch up to an on-prem product that's been in the marketplace for 20, 30 years. But, we feel great about where Flex is positioned today. And I think, based on some of the logos that we've actually been able to talk about and some of the Fortune 50 names, even anonymous names that we've been able to talk about during the last several calls, we feel great about where the adoption is headed. I'll tell you this as well, Rishi, that the energy and the interest in Flex from an inbound perspective alone has never been higher in -- than in the history of the product today. And so, we're incredibly excited about that. Now, in the way that that ends up translating to revenues and sales cycles, I don't know that it's going to dramatically impact that. I mean it does -- it is obviously going to accelerate it a little bit. But the reality is, is that these sales cycles take time. And if you're a huge retailer or a financial services provider that's running 20,000 agents off of your existing, you're probably going to slice off a line of business, for example, and give that to us. So, you're going to graduate from 500 agents initially to 5,000 to 10,000 and then beyond. So, I think, that's kind of the dynamic that we anticipate playing out. But, we feel really good about where the product is. I mean, again, a little bit lucky in terms of COVID and the way that it's impacted Flex. I wouldn't necessarily have wanted it to play out that way, but I think we find ourselves in a really fortunate spot. And we've got the right product certainly at the right time, and I think there's a lot that we're going to be able to win over the next several months to validate our ongoing belief in that product. I got an investor question, so I'll jump to that one. Just following up a little bit on the contact tracing thing. Does that mean that there's potential other areas to expand kind of in that government sector, like going government to constituent communications? I do think that that's kind of where we see it going. I mean, so, there's different tiers to that, right? So, there's federal government. And you've got to be FedRAMP certified to be able to do business at sort of the federal level. And we're in the process of -- it'll be a couple of years, but there are stages to being FedRAMP qualified. And I think you're aware that we've done some business, for example, with the VA in the past. So, I think national government level, we feel pretty good about what we're going to be able to do there over the next couple of years. We're already doing some work there initially. I think with the state, city, municipality level, we're quite excited about the ways in which we think governments are going to want to be able to reach their constituents. I mean, you already see it happening a little bit in terms of tax transactions. You've certainly seen a little bit of it with respect to election validations. I'm sure we'll talk about political traffic in a moment. There's other use cases where I think cities and states want to be able to interact with their constituents in a way in which it's not political per se, it's just getting them information that they need from a civic perspective. I know, I certainly get some private alerts, for example, right now just given kind of the fire dynamic in Northern California right now, and I think citizens, states and fire departments, police departments want to be able to get that kind of comms out too. So, I do think once we get through contact tracing and some of the urgency around that particular effort and use case, there's going to be a lot more that opens up. And then, obviously, you've got hospitals, which kind of fall into kind of a mix between private as well as mostly public, especially with municipalities. And we're already HIPAA certified and we've got high trust. And so we feel great about our ability to do business with health care providers. And so, I think you're just going to see more of that as we go. Of course. I mean, you're always one step ahead of me in the question. So, let's go straight into the political stuff. Just how should we be thinking about contribution from the November presidential election, I mean, we're two months away from that now, right? Especially since we can't have or shouldn't have in-person rallies in this environment, but that may still happen. And I think especially with the context of how much upside you got in 2018 from just the midterm elections? Yes. I think it's a good question. It's less than you might think. And there's two dynamics there. I think, one -- I mean, you're absolutely right. I mean, there definitely is some transition from what would otherwise happen in-person is now happening over the internet. The countervailing kind of circumstances is that based on a lot of the messages that were delivered back in that 3Q, 4Q '18 time frame, there was a fair amount of voter uproar over unwanted messages. And we certainly want to be on the right side of that where we're only sending messages to constituents that actually want to receive them from candidates from whom they want to receive them. And so, there's an opt-in dynamic today that didn't exist back then. And so, I think to some degree, that is going to mute volumes. I don't think it's going to be as material certainly on a percentage revenue contribution basis as it was two years ago. Two years ago, it turned out to be an extraordinary spike so much so that we actually called it out as a particular contributor because we think it -- we thought then it kind of -- it spiked our results a little bit in a way that we actually didn't think was representative. I don't think we quite see it the same way this year, but it's still early in the election cycle. And I think in the last, whatever it is, less than 50 days here till that final day, there probably is going to be an increase in interactions. It's just it's not obvious to me that that translates into revenue for us. Yes, got it. All right. I want to talk a little bit more partner-wise. So, we talked about SIs and the potential there. But, I'm interested on the other side of the equation, which is with ISVs, right? Obviously, you're an API company, so that lends itself to that. But, can we see the rise of more companies like Talkdesk, right, which is a $3 billion valuation company built on Twilio? Like, how are you thinking about that kind of partner ecosystem? Yes. I mean, we have a number of customers that basically act as ISVs, and I think you correctly characterized one of them. We have a number of others that it's a very kind of symbiotic relationship where they use parts of our stack, we use, in some cases -- not all, but in some cases, parts of their stack. And they're able to build and grow their business off of us that obviously drives some usage for us. And then, they have some additional kind of higher stack, value-added items that they're able to offer as well. But we love that relationship. I mean, I think, when you consider ISVs, I mean, most of these companies have deep developer bases. So, they're very much like-minded in terms of their approach and our approach to the world from a technology and developer perspective. And if we can continue to grow that portion of the ecosystem, I think that would be fantastic. I wouldn't limit our efforts just to ISVs. I mean, obviously, kind of these niche partners, boutique partners, if you will, that we've been able to cultivate in certain areas, particularly on certain geographies and products, have been really beneficial to us. And then, I think over time, we're going to want to grow into some more of these bigger partnerships, like a GSI, like Deloitte, where they're able to take products like Flex and other places that we intend to go in terms of our customer engagement stack and bring those solutions to market and build the business on top of that. We don't necessarily want to have like a huge pro-serve business. We'll do a little bit of that for white glove customers. But otherwise, we'd love for other companies to be really successful off of our APIs and make a ton of money themselves. I got another investor question. I want to ask this one because I know it's obviously important to you and clearly to Jeff based on his commentary on the call, which is, during these challenging times, what is Twilio doing to support employees, their families and the communities? Yes. It's a great question. So, the first thing is, is that we were, I think, if not the first, certainly one of the first companies to send our workforce to entirely work from home. We saw some signals early on, and I don't know if we were overly clairvoyant or not, but we sent our workforce home virtually immediately to be able to accommodate what we thought was a really rapidly evolving dynamic. Having done that, we immediately issued what I think is probably one of the most generous stipends for employees to develop a home office setup. We offer $1,500 for every single one of our employees. They can avail themselves of that for whatever purpose they need. I mean, it could be buying a standing desk or a chair, or they could use it -- in some warmer parts of the world, they've used it for air conditioning and stuff like that. That was all in the early days. And I think what -- so that we're talking like first couple of months. And I lead the effort, by the way. So, I have some first-hand knowledge here. So, what's transpired over the summer and I think more recently, it certainly kind of doubled down with some of the smoke dynamics, particularly in Northern California, is as children have gone back to school, we're certainly starting to see, as many other companies are, stress in the workplace in terms of working parents. There are others who are taking care of elderly folks. There are young people who are just feeling very isolated. And so, we provide a broad array of mental health services. We've also opened up a relationship with a caregiving company where we provide a free subscription so that our employees can avail themselves of that. We've extended employee leave for not just working parents but for all employees that need it for caretaking or mental health purposes. And we regularly survey our employees in terms of how are they doing, are they able to remain productive, how are they feeling from a mental health and kind of fatigue perspective. And I think, by and large, we've gotten really positive inputs from our teams. I mean, I think, our survey results have been fantastic. I communicate on kind of what's going on and when it's going on, et cetera, with our employees. I was doing it on a weekly basis. We've since moved that to kind of monthly as -- I can't even believe I'm saying this, but COVID has sort of become normal in a way or working from home has become normal. And then, I guess, the last thing I would just add is, we've allowed our employees to work from home on whatever terms they decide through August of 2021. And frankly, we've already communicated to our employees that -- but for one of our Northern European offices, we don't anticipate any of our offices opening until probably January. That's super helpful. I'm really glad to hear that being done. Okay. Twilio employees, I have talked to will absolutely back up what you're saying. [Multiple Speakers] And then, I'm sorry. There was one part of your question I didn't answer. I mean -- sorry, the one part of your question that I didn't answer is in terms of communities. We've been very active from a dialogue perspective. We've been very active with respect to BLM, both in terms of supporting organizations but also providing services for our employee base internally. Clearly, that's been the kind of the social injustice movement inside the United States. It's been a particular stressor, and we've done a lot to help employees and community organizations at large. And, I personally support a number of nonprofit organizations in that regard too. Thank you, because I really appreciate that and really appreciate the time. This has been super helpful. So, thank you so much. Sure. All right. Take care. Thank you.
