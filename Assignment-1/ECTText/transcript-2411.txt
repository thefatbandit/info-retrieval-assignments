Sure. And Samad, first of all, great to see you again. And then really to everybody else, now hopefully that people are doing well under everything that's going on in the world right now. As we look at the ITSM market and we haven't publicly disclosed our assessment and probably large market is that, if you look at Gartner they've sized at about $5 billion and then we're roughly about half of that. But when we look at - when we look at the market, I'll say a couple of things that we see. One is, within our existing customers, 6,000 customers that we have like we're probably under 50% penetrated with our ITSM solution in those existing accounts. And then on top of that, there is almost 30,000 other enterprises from a total market perspective. So we're only serving a fraction of that. So we actually think that the overall market is probably underrepresented. And this goes back to, like when we first IPOed and the market was originally seem to be about a $1.5 billion market like we're clearly over that just with our ITSM product today. So, net-net, I think that there is a tremendous amount of potential for us to continue to grow within just the ITSM market. Yes. So if you think about it from an ITSM perspective, as we came into this market just with the standard version we ultimately still provide, you had this need from customer which was a, as we shift the cloud drive a SaaS-based solution really do so from a one platform perspective with that one data model in our sets that we have. Like, that in and of itself was enabling our customers to deliver those experiences to employees and also to the knowledge workers within IT. And now from a Pro perspective, we're hearing from customers is really driving the focus in two areas. One is continue to improve the employee experience, even amidst the pandemic, like I still hear this a lot in talking to CIOs and their directs in terms of a focus for companies as it really trying to bring on boarding and keep captivated the employees by giving them better experiences. And then the second big thing that they're also trying to do is, we're trying to do that while being as effective and efficient as possible and making sure that the work that they're spending their time on is high value. And so ITSM Pro is really focused on delivering both of those outcomes. We take - and the power of AI and ML and the virtual agent and the predictive analytics that we have a lot of the supervised machine learning to make sure that we can give employees the answers that they need quickly and they can go on with their day, so they're not spending time bogged down, engage with IT. And then we take the use cases that are generally the low value, the menial work ones that are like VPN issues or password reset and really drive that engagement to be able to drive a full end to end automated workflow. And it's resonating with our customers. We've seen a 15% penetration with the Pro SKU and our existing customer base, there is still a tremendous amount of opportunity there. But at the same time there is like that time to value that customers are really looking for as they get some of these - some of these outcomes from a machine learning perspective, which drive in the end better experience and also help them be more effective in terms of how they are serving their customers from an knowledge work perspective. Yes. Look, we see a lot of demand from our customers, as we're either going into renewals or in net new on the Pro SKU, and I think we're going to continue to see that. Like we'll get over 50% of our customers onto Pro for sure. The thing that we're seeing is, there will probably be certain areas like, if you think about maybe going down a little bit more into the commercial space in places where they don't need as many of those advanced capabilities. So they're going to - let me stick with standard, but we do see like especially in enterprises and large enterprises from of our largest customers like that value to be able to drive the outcomes and leverage AI and ML at scale is something that customers are looking for. So you're right. There is still a lot of opportunity to go with our Pro SKU. Sure. So I've been at the Company for three years. And it probably took me a little while when I first joined to really understand this notion of this power of the platform that we talk about. Which is something that it really started resonating when I hear customers come back and talk about the power of the platform that they're getting from ServiceNow. And really at the core of the fact that we are one platform with one data model and then one workflow basically drives across it. It really enables something that I think is pretty revolutionary in industry basis and it's been one of the reasons why we've been able to drive from our starting point in service management into the operations world, into the planning world and then extend to other side of the business and true platform of platforms view, breaking into other systems of record and integrating to them. And to me, the reason why that is such a powerful story is because it means that we can ultimately deliver outcomes to customer. So from a service management perspective, or an operations management perspective, we're able to break silos of the tools and the teams that companies have to be able to get work done more effectively and efficiently and that happens at the workflow level. It also happens at the data level. And then the other thing that happens just the speed of innovation perspective, yes, we'll bring companies in, we do an acquisition and that doesn't mean we're going to re-platform them. But what it gives us is once we replatform them, those capabilities are now available to internal customers or our own businesses as they build solutions or own customers as we build solutions on top of the platform. And so what that means in the long run is, an ability to innovate, because we're not spending a lot of time on every release trying to integrate across the different solutions that we have. Because it's all needed for the platform. So that at the core I think is where the secret is. Yes. As a product person, what I will say is, it all starts with the outcomes for our customers. The most important thing for me is are we delivering outcomes. What are the use cases, where the fresh one is and how are those outcomes is getting to value. And focus both on employees, which is where a lot of the IT portfolio is but also customers because from an IT portfolio we enable outcomes through our customer workflows as well and making sure that those experiences are intuitive, they are native, they are dime, they are powerful is key. And what I will say is AI, ML and to be a means to an end to deliver that world-class experience. And taking the power of machine learning from all the data that's coming in, whether it's - or class tickets, others are coming in from people or suppose it's coming in from sensors and from the environment and been able to use that, find those needles in the haystack to be able to deliver a better experience whether that is at an employee level doing self-service, you can get your answer quickly, get on with your day or on a knowledge worker level being able to identify what are the things that, hey need to focus on, it's going to help either reduce time to resolve an issue or address the vulnerabilities that are mostly important, most critical to go and fix in environment. I think those are the outcomes that ultimately ML is going to provide. And I think, as you know, we've been - we've done a fair amount in terms of acquisition, dating back to beginning of 2017 when we acquired DxContinuum, both from a machine learning perspective NLU and NLP space. Then earlier this year, as we focus on AIOps and really making sure those outcomes on the operational side of value with our Loom acquisition which ultimately really is bringing together the service and operations management to be able to identify those issues and let knowledge workers quickly resolve problems for employees and customers. Yes. No - so as I mentioned, like if you think about what we're doing from a service management and from an operations management perspective, we really see those two capabilities driving the outcomes both on the employee customer side as well as for knowledge workers. And more and more like customers are looking to drive those together meaning like, if I can understand something in my environment that's coming from the operation space, I can more quickly resolve issues or serve customer before they create a ticket or an incident. And we've got very healthy business with ITOM. We can see - we see that growing to over $1 billion business. Right now our second largest product and portfolio on growing healthily. And an acquisition like Loom really does bring those two pieces together to drive some of those outcomes. And yes, from a Loom perspective, we've been very focused in AIOps and making sure that we're driving relevancy to take the operational world, find those needles in the haystack which is really about getting those insights that AIOps drives. And then the secret that we bring to that puzzle is, that we can actually drive the workflow on top of it. So a lot of AIOps is about understanding the world of data that we have. But with ServiceNow you can actually drive automated workflows on top of it and that's where we think like we lend an influence, the AIOps. And Loom is really helping us do that by taking all the data that exists and being able to quickly identify what is happening in the environment, get those needles in that hay stack out and then tie it to knowledge, tie it to insights, tie it to an actionable outcome that a team can go on and take. And then from a Sweagle perspective, one of the things that we talked about at our Knowledge '20 conference in May and we're going to be talking about more in Paris is this notion of a service graph. And if you think about our CMDB and the system of record that we're providing from the CMDB perspective, we think that like really as companies are driving outcomes in their operating state, they really need to take a service level view of everything that they have. And what that means is, it's not just about the infrastructure, the network devices what you have on primarily in the cloud, but it's also about configuration and then application and service and being able to show that holistically. And so we are announcing as part of our Paris release, some integrations that are from a service graph perspective bringing in that core data to be able to provide that visibility. And then Sweagle, well, I think it's going to do is, now it adds on this configuration layers, so I can understand my configuration and stay on top of my infrastructure estate to be able to drive better outcomes. And it ends [indiscernible] it means that I can resolve issues more quickly from a service management perspective, I understand what's happening in my environment, I can tie it to my critical business services from an operations management perspective. Or on the security side, I can resolve the vulnerabilities that I have, that are tied to my most critical services first. Yes. I'll say this like, we do build our solutions with the ability to drive them separate from CMDB mind. So you can do ITOM help without a CMDB. But the reality is that the value proposition - when I talk about that one platform and that one data model that losing the architecture, like a lot of it at the core is fronted by the system of record of the operating statement you have. And the reality is that every solution that we have both feeds and gets from the CMDB. And that's true for the products that we built, that's true for ISV community and that's true for our customers as well. So as an example, when we populate the CMDB from an ITOM perspective, it means, that now tie your incidents to your CIs, to the critical business services, which helps you prioritize and automate route work on service management side. It also then helps you from an asset management perspective to understand your asset state and quickly get to value to do audits or do entitlement checks for the assets that you have. And so there really that is a power like how you bring the data into that CMDB drives all these outcomes that we have crossing solutions set. And well - that just start on the IT side, it extends across the platform. So, from a customer service perspective as an example. You can deliver better customer service by understanding where an issue is, where it exists in your operating state, who that is tied to, so that now you can be proactive and engage with the customers and maybe impact it when or tied in your environment goes down and you know who the customers are, and know the team is working on it. And you can drive that better experience. So it strengthened not so from ITOM perspective, but really - it really drive that disproportionate platform value that I talked about earlier, as well. Yes. So first I'll talk internally and I'll talk about the ecosystem. So over the - kind of beginning of the last year, we've been very invested in terms building out those AI and ML capabilities for the operating state. Whether that's our operational cloud in solution what we're doing from a health perspective with bringing events in driving correlation and outcomes, as well as some of the acquisitions like Loom that are helping accelerate some of the outcomes that we want to drive from an AIOps perspective. And as I said like, that AIOps world is really taking a massive amount of data. We've been trying to drive insights from that data. And then on top of that, we're also investing and making sure then you go and take automated outcomes from those insights. And so we've got a healthy build and a lot of the ML, AI acquisitions that we've done like, DxContinuum and others are helping us do that because we're leveraging those under the covers to be able to drive instant prioritization or do better correlation within ServiceNow. Now I'll say this. In the end it's an ecosystem. We understand like our customers are going to have hundreds if not thousands of different solutions or tools that they're using across the software lifecycle to plan to have build and deliver operations. And so our view is really driving a full end to end single platform view across all those integrated platforms. And we've seen this in some of the analyst reports around value streams, managing the value stream layer like we really see our ability to drive that value stream and then do integrations with those different solutions to be able to bring that all into one common theme at last and drive those workflows across it. So it ends up being joint win-wins for our customers with the observability solutions with what we have on the platform. And ultimately the long-term goal is get those customers to the outcomes and provide that single paying that really lets you do the work across IT and then into the other parts of the C suite. Yes. So in - I'd say the pandemic like when I talk to customers like a lot of focus is from a technology perspective. How can I drive a better experience to my employees and customers. How can I drive operational productivity and then innovate more quickly. And in the pandemic that productivity on the operational side really like, been a big focus on operational resilience. And the other big thing that's also been sort of, at a short-term there's been a focus on, like how can you help me save costs and whether that's going to like an ITSM Pro that's helping drive better reflection, and make sure that your teams are focused on the things that are at highest value or from an asset management perspective understanding your license position and being able to say, if you're under-utilizing solutions. And so I think, like as I think of those outcomes and I think with the conversations that I'm having with CIOs and CTOs and their directs, like in the end through this pandemic like there has been a shift in focus and like a few areas of like, cost saving is important, I need to be able to drive ROI around the solutions, which we ultimately think we have a strong value proposition for. And broadly speaking, like if you look at across our customer base in serving the enterprise and large enterprise, because it's a - these are the largest companies in the world, like there is a lot of resilience and even though we've seen some impact in certain industries. We've also seen focus like we had a - as an example in the hotel space, one of our largest security deals ever we closed through this pandemic so even amidst some of the headwinds there are like there have been in this time frame so we've seen healthier pipeline than we've ever had it's definitely comparing to previous years and we do see, as we look forward. The big thing I would say is, in my conversations with IT technology leaders is that they do see this shift and the need of the pandemic, has really accelerated a long-term view to drive digital transformation and make sure the customers are - the companies are on the other side this digital divide. And so actually that's been reflected sort of if you look forward in through our future pipeline, as from the strength that we see going forward as this pandemic is. Yes. So let me - I'll talk about it through first at a concept level and we talk about the spirit of product as well. But concept level, as you as these costumers plan to go and digitally transform their - they are focused on few things, they want to be more agile, they want to move workloads to cloud, they want to innovate more quickly at the core. And they're trying to do so and trying to bridge the central pieces they have within IT to the teams that they're working with are doing engineering. And that could be a team that is working on waterfall for like an ERP deployment or something like that. Or more and more it sees digital teams are kind of move much more quickly and innovate fast. And as every company becomes a software company, like IT is really trying to look across both of these and drive that pace of innovation, while maintaining security and governance and quality through the pipeline. And so that ends up being a very strong value proposition for us which is we're already a trusted advisor in Central IT and now it's a bridge and an connecting to these teams to be able to enable them to work and collaborate more quickly as a world of what you'd take traditional IT and the engineering teams are coming to closer together. And so we see that as a strong tailwind for us. Our DevOps product really does provide some those capabilities. But really it's across our entire product line, like our operations management or even from a planning perspective our ITBM solution, making sure that we're driving both visibility to the waterfall world as well as the agile world really brings out single pane of glass together. So net-net, I think I am very optimistic around how we enable customers to drive to the other side of this digital CASM by providing this capabilities and DevOps is definitely one of the ways that we're doing that. Thanks everybody.Hi, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. My name is Samad Samana. I cover software here at Jefferies, including ServiceNow, and with us we have Pablo Stern, SVP of IT Workflows at ServiceNow. And so we're very thankful that you're able to join us, Pablo. It's certainly a lot going on in both the software, the world in general, and we appreciate in advance you to take some time out to share your thoughts with us. And so, yes, I think since some investors get less face time with you, I actually think just to give you a really interesting conversation, because it will be more product-oriented and maybe less short-term and so. But if we could maybe start at one high level question we get asked all the time about maybe the total addressable market and especially in the content stuff, IT and how much opportunity is left there for ServiceNow? So maybe you could start there and frame the TAM and frame the opportunity in ITSM and the other IT products. And I think we'll go from there. Okay, that's helpful. And then I think that with the rollout of ITSM Pro, we've been asked the question a lot. How do we think about maybe the primary features and functionality differences between the core ITSM offering that ServiceNow historically had and what Pro offers and how should we think about the main differences there? Got you. Just you mentioned the 15% penetration, and I think it just shows how much opportunity is left there. But maybe, how should we think about is - would every user that's using core ITSM today need to use Pro or is it really meant for a certain level of work of IT worker in some kind of inside of the customer base. How should we think about maybe what's the realistic amount of people that would need a Pro SKU versus just a traditional ITSM offering? Great. Maybe taking a step back and looking again a little bit more big picture. ServiceNow has been in the market for a long time, you mentioned that you guys have very healthy market share if we look at it against, look at Gartner and IDC. How do you think about ServiceNow's differentiation at this stage versus some of your more well known competitor - not more well known, you guys, but well known competitors by the investment community, like a BMC, legacy Micro Focus. How should we think about the competitive environment, and if there's been any change or evolution there as you think about net new or incremental ITSM deals? Great. And I think multiple times over the course of conversation you've mentioned Machine Learning and AI and I know that's been a big focus for the Company in terms of building that into the existing platform. Can you maybe talk to how you're leveraging AI and ML in the IT product portfolio and ultimately like how our customers using that within the ServiceNow platform to extract value? That's actually a good set of point. So I had on my list of questions to ask about both Loom and I hope I don't put through the same Sweagle, I think is that how to pronounce it. And I know that was the bolster, the ITOM capability is and I know you mentioned with Loom the AIOps side as well. So maybe this is a good way to switch gears into how the company's momentum in IT operations management has looked and how both, how did those two acquisitions that are a little bit more focused in that area. How should we think about that the signal of where the importance of ITOM is or how much of a focus it is in 2020 and then maybe really beyond that? There is two threads on I want to pull on there because this feels like now a lifetime ago back in late February you guys had your federal forum and when we were down there, a lot of the feedback we often get is, is that having the ServiceNow be the core configuration Management Database oftentimes leads to the adoption of ITOM or [GRCM] on the security side. So I think for those of us may be are not necessarily technologist, but that maybe if you could help us understand why it's so important to marry ServiceNow, CMDB offering? And why that matters so much for the adoption of ITOM and for security as well. Yes, I was going to say, I think it speaks to the platform being the core allowing you to stitch everything together with one clean data model. So I'm - just because we only have about 7, 8 minutes left, I'm going to read in some audience questions as well. So the first one is a question that is focused on the - I believe on AIOps, but the question is how much of it's ServiceNow internally built versus partnering with other companies such as Datadog, maybe just helping us understand what's native versus what's done by partnerships? Great. That's very helpful. And then another one that - as much as this is both from products but maybe a more short-term oriented one. Absolutely COVID is on everybody's mind and the associated impact. I'm just - I'm curious maybe if you could talk to what you see from your seat in terms of customer dynamics whether that's retention or how customer conversations have developed for the deals that you're an executive sponsor for. Just how is customer behavior been as far as your view in terms of decision-making? Very helpful. So I have time for one more question for the people that are pinging me. So I'll end with a product question. Yes, I think DevOps makes a lot of sense for ServiceNow as a natural extension. So maybe just how important do you see that, for customers and how do you - how are conversations in terms of cross selling DevOps and installed base going from your perspective? Great. Well, Pablo, we really appreciate your time. I think that that was - I know it's very helpful for me to dig in deeper into the technology and product side. And your insights are definitely unique to some of the conversations we had. So, thank you so much for your time today. Hope all is well on your end. And we tried to get as many questions, it was a good for the audience, but I'm going to go head and apologize, we only had 25 minutes, but thanks again for joining us. I really appreciate it.
