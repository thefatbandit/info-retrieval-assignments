I will now turn the call over to Ron. Thank you, Ron. I'm pleased to report that the second quarter was a third straight quarter strong performance, very strong and significantly improved, adjusted EBITDA income was positive. These are real earnings and improved cash flow generation, which I think is much more impressive considering the challenging business environment that company has face these days? So, let's go into a little bit deeper detail into our Q2 results. Consolidated revenue was $39 million, a decrease of 7.1% from the second quarter of 2019 on an as-reported basis and a decrease of 5.4% on a constant dollar basis adjusted for changes in foreign currency exchange rates. While revenue was down around $3 million on an as-reported basis year-over-year, I would note that the recurring revenue from the core recovery audit business is more stable than may appear from the consolidated as-reported results. Furthermore, I believe our revenue performance in light of the challenges posed by the COVID operating environment highlight the resilience of our business model. In this sort of environment, we believe the contingency fee based nature of our business actually plays to our advantage as it poses no obligation to our clients other than to share their data with us so we can find discrepancies that yield cash for our clients and revenue for PRGX. Of the roughly $3 million decline year-over-year, about $300,000 was due to a decline in adjacent services, which was the result of a decision on our part to pull back from doing unprofitable advisory projects and about $700,000 of the decline was due to the weakening of the currencies of our international operations. The core recovery audit part of our business declined about 4.8% year-over-year. As for some color on our quarterly revenue performance in the service lines and regions, recovery audit Americas decreased 6.8% year-over-year on an as-reported basis, and 5.5% on a constant dollar basis. There the retail part of the business was done modestly, while the commercial side had a bigger decline. As we've noted before, the commercial as well as the contract compliance part of the business can be lumpy from time-to-time and last year's quarter was a relatively stronger period, which made for a challenging comp this year. Also, COVID-19 has lengthened or delayed the audit process for some new audits, which generally has more of an impact on the commercial side of the business. Overall, this part of the business continues to be developing as expected. Recovery audit in Europe and Asia-Pacific decreased 5.7% on an as-reported basis and by 3.1% on a constant dollar basis. As I just noted, currency swings during the quarter as well as during the last year created a headwind for international operations on an as-reported basis. The retail part of the business decreased more than the overall segment, while the commercial part of the business grew on both an as-reported and constant currency basis, as was the case in the first quarter of 2020. As for adjacent services, revenue was down about $300,000. year-over-year. This decline was primarily due to the de-emphasis on the advisory project based part of our business, which was not producing the profitability we desired. Revenue from the more recurring revenue based analytics and solutions part of our business grew year-over-year and we're optimistic that we scale this in a profitable, but measured fashion as we ramp up our next generation technology platform. As for second quarter adjusted EBITDA, and this is the part that we're particularly pleased to talk about, adjusted EBITDA was $7.6 million compared to $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2019. And the adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.4% of revenue in the second quarter of 2020 versus 6.8% in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of over 1,200 bps year-over-year. This is due to the efforts of our entire team to deliver on our commitment of improved efficiency and profitability beginning in mid-2019. This is the third straight quarter of strong financial performance, reflecting the benefits of our efficiency initiatives. As Ron noted, this is our best second quarter adjusted EBITDA in seven years, which is a follow-up to our two prior quarters that were similarly the best quarterly adjusted EBITDA results in a number of years. The PRGX team has done a tremendous job in driving efficiencies and improving productivity, and I look forward to striving further productivity enhancements in the future. Moving to our discussion of net income. Net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $400,000, a significant improvement from the loss last year and was largely driven by the same factors impacting revenue and adjusted EBITDA performance. Going forward, we expect to increasingly focus on net income as a key profitability measure. This is the first quarter of positive net income since I joined the company in early 2019. So, I'm very pleased that we've achieved this milestone. Due to the annual cyclicality of claim generation and the associated expenses versus the revenue realization of claims, its typically more challenging to achieve profitability in the first and second quarters of the year versus the third and fourth quarters of the year, which makes achieving net income in a second quarter that much more notable. I'd also note that we had a non-recurring expense of $1.3 million during the quarter, which also adversely impacted net income. This expense resulted from the investigation and final settlement of a claim by a former employee. While this expense is included in SG&A expense, we have broken out this non-recurring item in our adjusted EBITDA reconciliation. That should provide some additional context that makes our achievement a positive net income that's much more noteworthy. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $21.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, $37 in debt, and $36.8 million of net accounts receivable. Our net debt balance at the end of the quarter defined as borrowings less cash balances was $15.5 million, down from $19.3 million in the first quarter of 2020 and down from a peak of $24.8 million at the end of Q3 of last year. As for our accounts receivable, day sales outstanding improved during the quarter despite the generally more challenging business environment, which speaks to the general strong quality of our client base. Turning the capital expenditures. They were $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2020, down from $3.2 million in the second quarter of 2019. We're focused on the rollout and adoption of our new audit foundation and platform, which we believe will be important in achieving further efficiency gains. We expect CapEx for 2020 to be down significantly from 2019 and expected to come in around $10 million. Turning to adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2020, we're increasing our guidance and establishing a range of adjusted EBITDA of $29 million to $30 million. This guidance is based on our current assessment of the business environment in a COVID-19 world and our current expectation of a modestly lower revenue level for 2020 compared to 2019. As Ron noted earlier, this would represent 18% plus adjusted EBITDA margins for 2020, an increase of more than 500 bps compared to the 13% we reported in 2019. With respect to the strategic objective of being the highest performing and most efficient recovery audit firm with a goal of achieving 20% plus adjusted EBITDA margins on an annual basis within the next two to three years. Because we've made such progress during 2020, we believe we'll likely achieve 20% margins earlier than originally expected. We're working to reengineer both audit processes in the field as well as the information we use to manage our business and make resource allocation decisions. As we make progress with those sorts of reengineering efforts, we believe that we'll be able to further expand margins to continue to improve profitability and free cash flow. As you've heard from us more recently, we have increased our focus on free cash flow generation, which we believe to be even more important than usual in this pandemic environment. The combination of expected 2020 adjusted EBITDA $29 million to $30 million less the combination of the following; CapEx guidance of around $10 million, interest expense and income taxes of around $4 million, and transformation related expenses of around $2 million should enable us to generate free cash flow near the mid-teens during 2020. Achieving this would be a significant improvement compared to our average performance over the last six years of around $6 million per year, which is clearly more than a doubling of that level with what I just laid out. We believe this is the primary driver of shareholder value in our business and we intend to maintain our keen focus on free cash flow generation going forward. To accentuate some of Ron's points from earlier, we think we have our strategic priorities clearly set for the next few years. First, focus on performance. Consistent delivery of these newly elevated levels of profitability year in and year out, we will incessantly focus on being the highest performing and most efficient recovery audit firm and we believe we've made some really good progress in this area already. Second, focus on our platform. As we migrate our business to the common next generation audit platform, these foundational pieces are necessary in order for us to evolve our core business from a contingency fee-oriented post-audit recovery provider to a prepayment error prevention subscription oriented business partner in the future. By executing on these strategic objectives, we believe we'll best be able to drive shareholder value for investors. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the PRGX Global, Inc. Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kurt Abkemeier, CFO. Please go ahead, sir.Thanks Kurt. Well, we had a great quarter continuing to deliver on our promises of fiscal discipline, improved productivity, and expanded operating leverage. We achieved another milestone, delivering our second highest quarter adjusted EBITDA in seven years. And very important to all of us, it was a third strong quarter in a row which demonstrates consistency in our business performance and fulfillment of our commitment to improve profitability, and cash flow that we laid out to The Street a year ago. Establishing a track record of strong operating and financial performance has been our primary objective as we work to deliver improved client and shareholder value. So, let me give you an overview of the quarter. I'll take a few minutes to share a few notable highlights of the quarter, which Kurt will discuss in greater detail. Revenue was relatively stable at $39 million during the first full quarter in a COVID-19 environment, a decrease of 5.4% on a constant dollar basis. This is a testament to the composition of our revenue streams and the discipline focus of our audit teams as we've learned to operate effectively in this challenging environment. We achieved $7.6 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was primarily driven by our focus on continued productivity enhancements over the last year. In addition, we have positive net income of $400,000, which was our first positive second quarter net income performance in five years. I would like to emphasize that this notable accomplished was not achieved due to a one-time benefit, but rather, is the result of improved property performance. So, I'm very pleased with our improved financial performance over the last several quarters. This journey has truly been a full team effort and I want to formally recognize the PRGX team around the world for stepping up to the challenge during this global pandemic. Looking ahead, I am confident that we continue to deliver strong results. We shared previously, over three quarters of our revenue comes from clients, providing were considered essential goods and services whose businesses have not been adversely impacted from the global pandemic. The large majority of our clients continue to place high value on our ability to identify source to pay discrepancies and generate critical working capital. Further, our recovery audit and Contract Compliance services continue to perform at normal levels of productivity or higher. So, based on our strong operating performance in the first half of the year, and our positive outlook for the remaining part of the year, we're increasing our guidance for 2020 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $29 million to $30 million. We are confident in our ability to deliver this level of operating profitability for 2020 and value the importance of establishing this new elevated level of operating profitability, and delivering it consistently into the future. Now, I'd like to take a few minutes and talk about our progress toward the strategy objectives we established at the beginning of this year. I'm going to keep my comments brief, as I think our results largely speak for themselves. The first strategic objective relates to performance. That is to be the highest performing and most efficient recovery audit firm in the world. So, we've made meaningful progress against this objective with significant improvement in operating performance, introduction of new technology platforms, and innovations in our audit services. On our fourth quarter call in late February, we established an objective of achieving over 20% adjusted EBITDA margins over the next two to three years. Now, we believe we'll pick up 500 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin in 2020 alone to improve from 13% adjusted EBITDA in 2019 to at least 18% adjusted EBITDA margin this year, with actions that we've taken already.  As a result of the progress we've made this year, we believe we'll achieve our objective earlier than originally expected, and look to exceed our original goal within the next two to three year timeframe. The second strategic objective relates to our new technology platform and associated revenue model. This objective is to evolve our core business from a contingency fee oriented post audit recovery audit provider to a pre-payment error prevention and subscription oriented business partner. In order to achieve this future state that we envision for the business, it's absolutely critical that we build out the foundational components required for a next generation approach and implement these components across our client base. Now this objective requires moving our audit business to a common next generation on a platform built around global best practices, innovative audit concepts and advanced automation. Now, as we pivot our business to leverage this platform, we expect to drive further improvements in operating efficiencies, increase revenue with a larger percentage of subscription revenues and sustainable competitive differentiation as we lead our industry forward in the next generation source to pay compliance services, We're making steady progress on getting these pieces in place, but will take time for us to fully realize this transformation. Based on the results we're seeing thus far and the response from our clients as we share our strategy and vision, I'm confident that we're moving down the right path. It's imperative that we keep pushing forward on this strategic objective, which we believe will result in enhanced shareholder value creation. Now, I'd like to turn the conversation over to Kurt to go over our strong results in the quarter in greater detail. Kurt? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Alex Paris from Barrington Research. You may begin. Hi guys, congratulations on the third beat in a row, I'd like to see the raised guidance as well. Thanks Alex. So, you did this all during COVID and you had a very good first pass relative to expectations, that has to do with your client base your long-term and stable client base grocery, mass market, retail pharmacy, eCommerce. I suspect that this group of clients are benefiting in terms of increased revenue as a result of COVID as you talked about on previous call supply chains out of whack. More complexity, these are good things for PRGX. My question is, when do you begin auditing this COVID impacted data? I need your audit in arrears that you said before six months, nine months, 12 months? When should we start to see a little lift from that in the second half of the year or not until 2021? Well, we -- thanks. Thanks, Alex. And good to hear from you. We -- as you know, we will be auditing. We're just starting to audit the first wave of our COVID costs and expenses that we that we audit. The last quarter was primarily focused on pre-COVID, although we have a few clients that are more, more real-time and closer to the transaction. So, we've just started to get into it and it'll be -- you know, we have some clients that are three to six to nine months after the transaction that we're auditing. So, it'll continue, but we should start seeing some indications this quarter of the world of COVID. Now, we track on a regular basis what's going on, especially in the retail sector, which also in the grocery world, you will have a direct relationship to the consumer goods manufacturers as well. And it continues to be very significant uptick year-over-year. And so we watch that closely, and we know that we'll be auditing a greater volume of spin, we know that supply chains are have been a bit out of whack with the increased demand and some of the challenges that companies are facing so. We're not right now predicting in terms of a massive lift in our revenue as a result of COVID, but we are watching it carefully and we expect to deliver solid results for Q3 and Q4. Got you. And also within recovery audit, I think you've noted in the past some changes in the seasonal promotional pattern within retail. I believe you said that you've seen it shorter return to normal. And any further comment or color and promotional patterns? And sales-- Yes, I think, as we've talked before, we think for the most part, it's returned, generally to normal. And so thinking of demand patterns are pretty much stabilized now and as an increased level. You never know what the future is going to hold, but right now, we see things pretty much back to normal. Great. And then client bankruptcies, I think you guys did a lot of work going into this year, kind of assessing the exposure there. We've seen a few retail bankruptcies like J.C. Penney, Tier 1, GMC, [Indiscernible]. Any exposure there? Yes, I'll let Kurt answer that one because he tracks that very closely. Kurt? Yes, Alex, you're right. Going into the year as part of our forecast process, we would have made an assessment of bankruptcy risk across our client base. So, that already was baked into any of our planning process at the beginning of the year. And we've been tracking it very closely through these two quarters since COVID-19 hit and as testament to really our client base, we are generally doing business with clients that provide essential goods and services. So, we're highly represented -- over-represented by those high quality customers and underrepresented by the retailers out there that are at risk. Not one of the clients that you just mentioned, I should say -- not any of the companies that you mentioned, that filed for bankruptcy are clients of ours. So, we've been very fortunate that that we have a very solid customer base and very low exposure at this point in bankruptcy risk. Good to hear. Thank you. Just a couple last ones. I think on the last call, you talked about a small number of clients delayed audits given the COVID situation. I guess my question is why and what has happened since? We had several clients that asked us either specifically to not audit certain suppliers because they were concerned about the suppliers, getting through this pandemic period. And for the most part, most of those situations have gone back to the auditing. So, we kind of gotten through that. Say the -- probably the biggest impact we've had is on starting up of new clients, especially in our commercial business, onboarding and getting revenue started for new clients are an important part of our revenue stream. And we've had certain cases where either we've been delayed because of just wanting to take it slow as the initial or they want to start with a smaller scope of services initially. So, I'd say that's another area that's impacted us that we don't see these as long-term losses of revenue opportunity, but more of a delay and pushing it out, but we do see that to some degree. Okay. And then the last one for now, I guess is can you give us a little color on new business development in this environment. I know historically you've relied on trade shows and conferences. Now, got other things. I know Q1 bookings were ahead of plan, where did you shakeout in Q2? So, Q2 was -- we're coming in pretty close to plan. Some of the things that we expected to close in Q2 got pushed out to Q3. But looking ahead, that we're very pleased with the outlook for Q3 and Q4 in terms of the pipeline we have and the level of commitments we have for the new business, both in retail clients and commercial. So, we feel good and I'll tell you what I'm really pleased about is coming into the year, as we talked before and you mentioned we relied on going to various industry shows and conferences to generate leads. And we've really had to take a step back and put a lot more emphasis on webinars and our white papers and generating interest from intellectual property that we published through or we get articles published. And at this point in the year, our actual leads generated from our BDR team and our sales team is actually higher year-to-date than we were last year. So, I think we've made a solid transition and our sales teams are learning to sell -- the Microsoft Teams resumed very effectively. So it's -- we're pleased with how we've made that transition and feel like we're on a good trajectory for bookings for the 2020 year. Great. Well, it sure sounds that way. Again, three big quarters in a row, you raised guidance. I know you're small, but this seems to be sort of a perfect stock for the COVID experience and you can buy it in less than five times EBITDA. So, while we're very encouraged. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thanks Alex.  Thank you. And our next question comes from Zach Cummins from B. Riley FBR. You may begin. Yes. Hi, good afternoon, Ron and Kurt. Congratulations again, on the strong Q2 results. I just want to focus on the gross margin line in the quarter. This is by far the best Q2 gross margin we've seen in the business in a long time. So, I was just wondering, are there any one-time benefits or reclassifications that need to be called out? And then I guess what sort of a margin assumption should we make going forward for those businesses? Is this type of gross margin really sustainable going forward? Kurt, definitely should take this one. Go ahead. Yes. There were no one-time benefits -- any kind of material one-time benefits during the quarter. I think that this is really due mostly to all of the hard work that our team has done to try to take costs out of the business, that we think we're redundant, not necessary. And they've done a great job calling it out of the business. And we think that we can perform at this level and even improve upon it going forward, especially as we get some of our new platforms really humming and can approach our business from a different perspective. Got it. That's helpful. And then, Ron, I know one of the bigger strategies going forward is rolling out a subscription offering, and I believe that you may have a beta test out in the commercial segment. I was just curious if you could provide any kind of feedback you've received thus far or from kind of some of the early adopters? And so -- we are -- let me just clarify for you. So, we're in the midst of rolling out our global audit platform. We're in the early days of rolling it out to clients and starting to operate in a different environment. But in terms of clients moving to subscription-based audit services, that's still something that we are looking down the road to start. And we do have a -- you may be thinking about our preventive audit pilot that we've secured this quarter that we're pretty excited about where we're starting to get out in front of the promotional event and/or being during the promotional event, identify discrepancies that that would actually prevent a recovery. And that's much appreciated by both the retailer and the supplier and we have our first -- we have a significant pilot underway, that we just secured and that will start to lead towards getting to this kind of the subscription service and recovery audit services. And I would point out in our contract compliance services, which we've talked about in the past, that we continue to have good success in converting clients from contingency base to flat rate, or at least a hybrid where there's a partial flat rate and partial up contingency. So, we are starting to move in the right direction, but we're going to let technology lead us down that path. Understood. That's helpful. And then final question for me. I mean it's really great to see the meaningful progress that we've seen with both adjusted EBITDA, margin expansion, and free cash flow generation over the past three quarters. I'm just curious what do you view as some of the key aspects of getting this business back to organic revenue growth in FY 2021? Yes, that's a great question. And I'll just tell you that when we had this Q2 discussion last year, where our commitment was to get our business performing at a significantly higher level and we put the brakes on some of the adjacent services business segments that were not particularly profitable or a bit lumpy and really focused on getting our core business in high performance mode and focusing on our technology platform to get that finished and to start getting it rolled out. And I can tell you that we feel very good about where we are, we see by these results. And we're going to lean to revenue growth from a higher performance audit business plus the technology foundation that we're building that we can start to really deliver the technology. There are offerings that are repeatable, that are scalable with the appropriate level of margins, and we're just starting to get that moving again. But we still are in the rollout stage and the development stage of that platform. But I'd say that as we look ahead, we're getting some very good response to the market. We're winning some new clients and largely because of the technology platform and that'll continue to be the case a lot of interest in some of the next generation audit concepts that we're building into our platform for many of our clients. And that's going to generate some new business that'll turn into new revenues and then we'll continue to move our clients into the new platform over the next year or so. So, we expect things to start moving in the right direction in 2021 and in 2022, but on a much more profitable and scalable base than we had in the past. Great. That's helpful. Well, thanks again for taking my questions. And congrats again on the really strong results. Yes, Zach. Thank you Thanks Zach. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ron Stewart for any closing remarks. Thank you very much, Victor and thanks to all of you for joining our call. Again, we're very pleased with the quarter and we are working hard to continue this momentum for the rest of the year. So, we look forward to our next call when we talk about our Q3 results. Take care and everyone stay safe. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
