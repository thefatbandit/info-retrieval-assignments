Good morning or good afternoon to those of you in Europe. This is Andrew Baum from Citiâ€™s Global Healthcare team. Delighted to introduce our next session, as you'll see from the roster of many faces above me, we have the management from Merck, namely, Roy Baynes, the Chief Development Officer and Chief Medical Officer and Peter Dannenbaum, the Head of Investor Relations. Many thanks both of you for joining us. We've got about 45 minutes. I want to keep it a free flowing discussion. If you do have a question that you would like to ask, Roy or Peter, then please do email me on andrew.baum@citi.com. So, maybe a leading question to start. The criticism that we get from investors, and obviously we've been a very long-term bull of immune-oncology and Merck in particular, is that -- there is too much dependency on KEYTRUDA. The durability of KEYTRUDA is questioned in terms of biosimilars entrance. And more than that the absence of visible pipeline drivers further increases that centricity as well as the spin coming up later in the year. So, I wanted to give you an opportunity to say whether you think the investor base really has a fair opinion of the true extent of Merck's pipeline. Because from my perspective, I can see an awful lot of activity in terms of clinical trials and I know trials that you have ongoing. But you disclose far less data than perhaps some of your peers when it relates to Phase I, Phase II. And I understand why you do that from a competitive point of view, but do you think Merck has that balance right i.e., to minimize competitive risks, but at the same time benefiting from it and the share price. How do you think about that consideration? Well, I'll just take an R&D perspective on this disciple. And that is that, we're very pleased with where the all of KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA is really a remarkable product and is transforming the cancer care landscape. This has a number of consequences. Obviously, it becomes widely used across many different tumors. Our strategy has led to, obviously, development of significant precision medicine tools to enable patient selection and understand resistance. And that's provided tremendous entree into potential combinations, which might be beneficial. So, as we look at that, we have over 20 different internal molecules that they're combining with KEYTRUDA, many of which have pretty impressive effects in early stage trials. The other consequence of having a molecule such as KEYTRUDA, is that pretty much anyone in the oncology space, it has a promising molecule is eager to explore the combination. And so, we have a very large extramural collaboration program identifying combination. So, just from the idea of the KEYTRUDA concentration that is actually not a bad thing scientifically, and it's helped us enormously in terms of changing the landscape of cancer care. That having been said, we're not just say oncology company. We have a pretty broad portfolio. And in fact, the visible pipeline is a largely derisked pipeline, with candidates in a number of important therapeutic areas. And we happy to step through some of those if there's an appetite to do that. Obviously, we span cardiovascular medicine, neurosciences, vaccines, infectious disease, spoken obviously to oncology. We have a tremendous track record in cardiovascular medicine, and an impressive array of molecules in the inflammatory and respiratory space. So, as you look across all of that, there are significant late stage development programs across most of those therapeutic areas as I say, are largely derisked, and we believe that there is tremendous growth drivers outside of just the KEYTRUDA story. But we're very pleased with the KEYTRUDA story. It really has transformed the care of the cancer patient. And I must say every time we getting an additional indicational approval and we update the label, it's quite chastening to read that label. That label now reads like a textbook of oncology and it's been a great privilege and pleasure to be able to contribute to that. And I -- my question, just to clarify it wasn't in any way meant to understate the importance of KEYTRUDA self evident. It's really some of -- to bring out some of the features that indeed you mentioned, and you touched on very promising data from early stage compounds. And most investors when asked to discuss that, they'll think back to the initial STING data you presented a couple of years ago, which was -- that was the initial data on your TIGIT, which, it was dose raising data and a whole bunch of cold tumors in monotherapy as well as combo. But it was a small dataset and people might shrug their shoulders. So, that is the perception. I guess, what I'm driving at is when does that change? I know that you have the forthcoming ESMO forum coming up and you are showcasing some data that with both TIGIT and sort of the ILT4 the lobby too. So, without you wanting to -- without wanting to make you disclose that data set, perhaps you could talk to your level of excitement that you see in TIGIT and where do you think it fits in given that we have the Roche Genentech dataset out that it was some kind of anchor? And then, perhaps you could talk to ILT4 where you've been clearly expanding cohorts, suggestive of significant activity and I know that the post of that. So over to you. Well, thanks, Andrew. Yeah. So, let's just talk about STING, first of all, because you raised that. STING has been intriguing targets. I think it's been largely misunderstood. The approach that we had taken with STING initially was infant tumoral injection. There's no question that STING has an infant tumoral effect. And I think it's asking a lot of the molecule to really expect it to have huge abs circle effects in and of itself. So, we continue to explore STING. And we have a number of different STING candidates where we are looking at potentially an oral STING. We're looking at a systemic STING. We're looking at an institutional STING. So that program continues a pace. We actually have a Phase II study ongoing right now in the head, neck cancer. We know looking at infant tumoral. We also -- as you mentioned again, I'll highlight some data at the upcoming ESMO meeting and talking about tickets for just a moment, obviously an exciting target. Our assets, we believe is well developed. It has all the characteristics of what appears to be an effective molecule. We have conducted obviously some Phase I data, and we will be presenting some data at ESMO looking at the situation as it pertains to IO naive, non-small cell lung cancer in combination with KEYTRUDA. We are also looking at a higher experienced patients. And we have commenced a pretty substantial program. A number of these are umbrella type trials looking for signal detection with tickets. And based upon some of our encouraging data to the non-small cell lung cancer field, we do anticipate a Phase III study commencing early in 2021. So, ticket is certainly an area of focus for us. ILT4 and -- firstly related molecule ILT3, basically address the whole question of a myeloid suppressor, a population of cells, which is still to be a potentially important negative immune regulator. And we will be sharing some of our very initial data, again these are early data. So, I fortunate they're obviously looking at heavily pretreated patients in a lot of these circumstances. But we are very excited by what we see with ILT4. And that program is obviously moving ahead. This is in addition to many other candidates. I think everyone's aware of our CTLA-4 program, which is moving ahead in a number of different indications. And this has been carefully developed to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. We have mentioned previously elect three program. And as I said, we have some 20 assets which are internal, which are moving forward into Phase I and Phase II studies. So, it is a very broad portfolio. And we will be talking about it more essay to start to emerge. And so just picking you off on Phase III starts in 2021, which was I think the first time you've addressed that. And it's not a huge surprise obviously. Which indication are you pursuing? Is it --  I'm assuming it's non-small cell lung cancer, but is that in combination with KEYTRUDA or is that as part of a -- on top of a KEYTRUDA backbone? Right. The trial itself was not yet posted. We haven't had fulsome discussion of that yet, but you'll surmise around the indication is correct. So, non-small cell? Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, in terms of the CTLA-4, I forget which number it is. I wrote it down, but I've misplaced it. I'm sure it's top of your mind. But compared to ipilimumab and the therapeutic window that you believe that you have achieved. What does that mean in terms of ability to dose higher and therefore, is there any potential for superior efficacy than we've seen with IPI based combinations?  Yeah. The CTLA-4 field has been fairly complicated. There has been a lot of energy around CTLA-4. But to date, if you look for the convincing Phase III data that establish unequivocal efficacy of the CTLA-4 PD-1 combination marketed products, that's kind of hard to find, but there have been approvals. But indeed many of the cognizanti would argue that they have not necessarily met the high bar of demonstration of contributions. And clearly, there is a toxicity issue. So, we have developed 1308, which is our CTLA-4 in a thoughtful way to try and minimize toxicity. And we are seeing encouraging efficacy signals. And we certainly will be exploring this more broadly. I think the jury is still out there as to whether the addition of a CTLA-4 to a PD-1 overload is going to be transformative. That's the key question to be answered.  And we'll see that CTLA-4 data or the initial strong shift data from that CTLA-4 trial. Well, let's see that world lung, or we're going to have to wait into ASCO next year.  Yeah. We haven't disclosed where we plan to communicate that, but we do have a fairly emerging body of early data. Okay. Let's come back from oncology a bit, but just take a break from it for a short while. HIV. So, Merck unquestionably is one of the leaders in antiviral therapy and founding father of many of the categories of HIV drugs, including integrase inhibitors. You have, as we've pointed out, few years ago now was doravirine incredibly potent differentiated drug because of the pharmacokinetics as well as the potency. Your first opening gambit is the daily doravirine in combination, which has received relatively little attention from the market because there are already two drug regimens which are already approved. But when I look at the data that you made to live for this trial, I can see a point of significant differentiation, but yet I didn't hear him talking about it. So, I'm interested whether you share my view. And that is that we know that both TAF, as well as integrase inhibitors associated with weight gain. And you would imagine particularly among black female patients given what we've seen in previous trials. And, of course, your two drug regimen has neither of those and you're comparing it to BIKTARVY. Isn't it very likely when you run the trial, you will show a very significant delta in weight and potentially metabolic between the two arms. And it isn't of the self of relevance, particularly in relation to the competitive position against the existing incumbent devoto before we even start talking about long acting formulations and so on and so forth. Yeah. Well, I think your assessment is spot on. Indeed doravirine is remarkable drug. Its properties which are very important, you've highlighted potency and you highlighted pharmacokinetics. I would also highlight that it has a remarkable resistance profile. It also penetrates tissues remarkably well. Obviously that could be very important as pertains to certain invitations and combines well with other molecules. So, all in all, it has the potential to be a transformative agent in the HIV space. You've highlighted the once daily treatment. And you picked up clearly on the early signals if we do not see the weight gain associated with some of the other agents. I would just caution that those are early trials. And obviously we would like to see that replicated in large controlled experiment as you have suggested. But it does have the potential to be differentiating, for sure.  And that data will read out 20 21, right? The initial Phase III trial.  We currently are expecting the 2021 date, but these trials obviously we've been through COVID and we'll just have to see what the -- what the impact is, but that's the current thinking. Yes. And then, on islatravir PrEP where you don't need to partner it, which is a separate discussion. We'll come on to. GSK by running a trial in developing world, managed to show superiority versus standard-of-care, but it took them many patients in a very long time to do that. You and I have spoken previously about whether there may be certain accelerated development routes for this drug, including things like the part index. Do you think the FDA is open to discuss this? Or does the fact that GSK demonstrated superiority mean, well, if they can do it, then you should do it. And therefore, where you to -- your development path is set and you have to do a superiority trial versus to an alphabet. How's that? Where are we on that? Yeah. So, we haven't disclosed our strategy around PrEP. We are moving ahead with PrEP. I think FDA's been clear that, they're looking for a control trial in females and a control trial in an address male population. And we have been working closely with the FDA to optimize design so that this can indeed be executed with a reasonable sample size and reasonable duration of product. We have not disclose details yet, I want to assure you that this is moving ahead. And I'm assuming the -- in the PrEP I'm assuming won't be in the form of a daily tablet. It will be with one of the other formulations presumably the dapper [ph]. Well, the pharmacokinetics of this agent are intriguing. They are very favorable and the intracellular half life of the metabolites are actually extraordinarily long. So, we do believe that there is a definite potential care for a potentially cured all agent. Right. And then moving to the big commercial opportunity, which is the therapeutic one. The challenge is you have been investing in, is finding an agent with suitable pharmacokinetics to take advantage of islatravir. And obviously, you've been exploring pro drugs. That's not a failure, but exploring next-generation integrase inhibitors. How far are we away from being able to initiate a registration trial with less frequently dosed islatravir based combination of therapeutic setting. Right. So as you remarked early, Merck had a remarkable history in the area of the various classes of HIV agents. Obviously, we've been a leader in protease inhibitors and been a leader in integrase inhibitors clearly on nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. And we have explored a number of possibilities. We are advancing a internal Phase II candidates. And in addition, we're also very mindful of the external environment. And so, clearly, we are not opposed to partnering as well in this space. But I think rest assured the -- this frequent dosing treatment paradigm initially probably two week, will be looked at, and then, they are obviously agents that we might look to partner with for even longer intervals between application. And by that, I'm assuming given you rejected Cabotegravir some years ago. I'm assuming that leaves capsid inhibitors as being the obvious partner of choice to extend the dosing window. Yes. We haven't disclosed who the potential external collaborators might be, but we're obviously exploring all possibilities.  Got it. Okay. That's all I had on HIV. Perhaps we could go back to oncology for a little bit and then we'll move off onto some non-oncology targets. So, two licensed drugs, which you have conducting very extensive programs have been [indiscernible] both have demonstrated positive data, including an immuno-oncology -- well, one in the new immuno setting one, not yet. Could you talk to your level of confidence of using POP as maintenance treatment post KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung? And how that has changed with time? And I'm interested because when I speak to your counterpart or roughly your counterpart at AstraZeneca, your partner company, because is doubtful. I think it's fair to say that maintenance setting with part will work in non-small cell lung, because of the absence of value lik [ph] mutations of DDR or loss-of-heterozygosity. And as a result he's somewhat skeptical, obviously you initiated the trial a year or two ago and you have a different view. So, could you help me understand whether this is because you're betting on a different mechanism, but basically you think it's really unrelated to that? There's an immune stimulatory activity. What underpins the need or the conviction to test that hypothesis? Yeah. So I think, POP inhibition is still incompletely understood field. I think the prevailing theory of mechanism of action relates to synthetic lethality. And obviously then you get into all the questions of loss-of-heterozygosity and that as a key underpinning. What's interesting is if you actually look at the cellular signatures of the patient on POP inhibition [indiscernible]. And so there is counter view that indeed POP inhibitors are indeed a, orally available potentially less toxic form of Ekman type therapy. I think it's well described that a number of the settings where pops have been quite active are in settings where patients were initially platinum sensitive and that would certainly be consistent with an alternative hypothesis. We do have some early Phase II data that have spoken to the efficacy in certain tumor types unrelated to loss-of-heterozygosity. And so I think the question has to be answered. It is clearly a very tolerable approach. And I think it's a very worthwhile question to ask them. So, consequently, we are conducting a few randomized trials to try and get a definitive answer. And there's an ongoing trial called PEPSIN [indiscernible]. It doesn't have a checkpoints in it. It's chemo doublets followed by part maintenance versus chemo doublets. Where that trial and it's been running for a while now, but it's a proper trial that's sizeable and well run, et cetera. Were that trial not to show benefit for part maintenance. To what extent does that influence your opinion or you think the fact that there is no checkpoint agent within PEPSIN mean that actually it's not a useful data point in weighing the probability of success.  Yeah. I think we'd have to look at the data and understand it. Obviously, understand the size of the trial, the patient selection. And clearly ours are all combined with checkpoint inhibitors. So, that's the other sort of idea which we've added into the mix.  So, let's take a break from oncology for a second, and go to Gefapixant, which doesn't get much attention recently presented the data. It's clearly an unmet medical need. The magnitude of improvements in the primary endpoint isn't huge, but obviously, as I said, it's a material unmet medical need, and there is the metallic taste. How do you think this is enough given the paucity of treatment options that are available, as the first question? So what's your level of confidence that -- it's good enough to make a dent in a -- under unpenetrated market?  Yeah. So I think that the whole area of chronic cough is nearly a field which is emerging. And obviously, there are many different names applied to the syndrome. But for clarity, these are folk who know underlying causes been farmed for cough, but sort of high rates of coughing through the day have been fairly debilitating symptom. As you rightly say, there are no really approved agents, has been very little progress in this field. And treatment is generally with off-label applications of either low dose opiates or alternatively other neuromodulators. So, the P2X3 pathway is a Purinergic nervous system pathway. There is some evidence and actually quite persuasive evidence that quite a lot of the patients who have this entity of chronic cough, which is not due to some second week calls, have a high percentage that Purinergic nervous system and it's believed that the P2X3 pathway is important. So, we've actually conducted two Phase III studies, and we have shown unequivocally that there is a very meaningful reduction at the 45 milligram dose of cough rates. The absolute production is on the order of 60% to 70%. It's important to recognize this has been known for many years. There's also known from our Phase II program that there is a placebo effect in this, which is clearly understood that despite that we have an effect size which clearly is a superior to somebody the placebo effect observed. It is also important to note that as was presented, the median duration of coughs in these patients was only over 11 years. That's a remarkable disease burden for patients to have to carry around namely, chronic cough that is sort of endless and ongoing. We knew from our Phase II program that once patients have been in the Phase II, when a second Phase II open, they were clamoring to participate the stealing the drug had a salutary effect of the assumption of epidemiology. So, we're very encouraged by this. We have two Phase III studies. We have positive primary endpoints. They also have very strong supportive quality of life data going with them. And these are clearly trials we're trying to lead position. The competition is quite a ways behind. The taste at the separation is clearly an adverse effect. The fact that a majority of patients with taste for separation decided to stay on therapy, speaks to the perceived benefit risk of the patient's experience with this agent. So, it is a new field. Clearly, there's a lot of work to be done to flesh out the detail of that field, but this is a very large number of patients. The current epidemiology of this suggests that as many as 10% of patients in the world or people in the world have chronic cough, and about a third of those, there's no identifiable cause. So, we're talking about a fairly substantial patient population for whom the available therapies are really simply inadequate. And we're very encouraged by the Phase III data, which as you say, were presented last weekend. So -- from a -- I would imagine if I was at the agency, I would have -- my significant concern would be given this as a diagnosis of exclusion. The risk is that it could be given to patients. You have some sort of stroke neck disease, which may camouflage that. And obviously one things of non-small cell or small cell, or other diseases which results in chronic persistent cough, which might be marched in the same way as the PPI might mask, gastric cancer. How does Merck deal with that? And what is the -- what come up to? What does the regulator do? And who is the principal prescriber? Is it the pulmonologist? I'm guessing it's not the primary care practitioner, but that whole infrastructure, as you go from where you are now through the regulator to the market, how can we -- could you help me along that journey? Yeah. So, I think, the professional societies that recognize the entity of this chronic cough syndrome have been quite deliberate in how they thought about this. They have put a time window around this, and there's a strong recommendation that the major secondary causes I excluded during that time. So, in our discussions with regulators, there was agreement that we would put a time window around the inclusion in the study. And that would be a very meaningful surrogate for patients having had appropriate clinical workups and potentially therapeutic trials to interdict some of the known underlying causes. The fact that the median duration of patients on this trial was on the order of 11 years speaks to the fact that there is indeed a substantial cohort of patients who actually have chronic cough and where all these secondary causes have been largely excluded. So, I think that time window is of some importance. That begs the next question. And that is, is that time window too stringent because chronic cough clearly starts at some point along the way and what is the minimum time that should be exploded. We are doing some additional work to try to find a time window, which might be even more appropriate for patients with this debilitating cough syndrome. As to the prescriber, I think there's no single answer to this. In various jurisdictions, there are various degrees of awareness of chronic cough. There are chronic cough clinics in many countries. It'd be in your own country. Chronic cough is a well recognized entity. And the phenotype of the physician looking after these patients varies. This includes, for example, pulmonologists, allergists, asthma specialists, because ultimately a lot of folks have chronic cough get referred to one of the specialists categories that actually are responsible for some of the underlying cause excluding. So, the typical things that you exclude, obviously, concomitant medications, such as ACE inhibitors. You exclude gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper respiratory issues of a postnasal drip variety, hypersensitive airways as in asthma. So, all of these things get worked up. And so you could imagine there is some heterogeneity of the position cod ray that actually looks after this patient population. And obviously, we have to work very closely to address those groups. I will just say that the trials enrolled very quickly and in our experience -- at least my experience, rate of enrollment is a good proxy for pent up demand. And so leveraging the folks who have participated in our clinical programs will be very important as we begin to map out what that patient journey really looks like. So, when -- it's a drug that doesn't, and hasn't historically received much focus from the investor community, because of the diagnosis exclusion, perhaps the unfamiliarity and perhaps some awareness of the adverse event. And although, not serious, troublesome and unpleasant, or it could be unpleasant for the patient. But listening to you, it sounds like the commercial and medical importance of it is perhaps far greater than is externally perceived by the market. Is that a fair conclusion? I think for that percentage of patients, that's a very true statement. Again, just to emphasize, if you've been troubled by troublesome cough continuously through the day for 11 years, that's a pretty major burden to walk around with.  Yeah. I understand. So, when the sort of the last innings of the course over the last 10, 15 minutes or so, we should talk about COVID, which here, again, despite Merck's legacy in antivirals and as a vaccine manufacturer, you singularly are overlooked by the market. You have been relatively quiet in your disclosures over the progress of your various vaccines. And obviously, it's deliberate choice. It's not accidental. But starting with the two vaccine and the vector, virus vector vaccines that you're using. First question in light of the case of Transverse Myelitis reports here to Astra yesterday, and assuming it is Transverse Myelitis and assuming it is triggered by the fact that we using an AV based vaccine. Is that of a concern for you? Or is your experience with a bowler make you relatively relaxed that actually this is not something that's necessarily going to be problematic for you. So, thoughts on safety or platform?  I certainly wouldn't make that overarching statement. I mean, this is why you have to do large Phase III clinical trials, why they have to actually address meaningful numbers of patients. Because remember, we are vaccinating in many cases patients who would otherwise be normal. And so, the seam safety is obviously really important. And I think we have to proceed with very, deliberate caution, and ensure that we indeed have a safe profile. You do make the point that both of our vaccines are based on established platforms. So, one candidate V591 is based upon a measles vaccine platform. And we know that this vaccine has been into literally tens of or hundreds of millions of patients. So, it's not like this is a philosophic for this particular replicating viral platform. The other one, as you rightly comment is based upon how vesicular stomatitis virus platform. And again, that is a well validated platform. It is the basis about the Ebola vaccine. And so when we decided to look at deploying potential covert vaccines, we really wanted to work with platforms if we had a lot of confidence around. And as a consequence we picked these two, the other five-year here is a hope is that we might have a single dose exposure. As you can imagine, but the raging pandemic, multiple doses are less desirable than the single dose. So that was another idea behind the two platforms that we have chosen. And we are progressing both of these platforms. And the decision not to use a protein subunit vaccine. Was this because you believe that you need CDAs and these viral vector is better positioned to get CDAs, or entirely a different set of reasons.  I think these are both well-validated platforms, well-recognized to produce humoral and cellular immunity. Most of the vaccines that you're seeing developed are targeting the spike protein, which is thought to be fundamental to the cellular uptake of the buyers. And so, the idea here was, as I said to you as well validated platforms that create boredom unity, that potentially lend themselves to single dose application. The only reason that I was asking is because the majority of protein subunit vaccines don't typically produce high CDA titers. And I was trying to -- I was wondered whether this was -- you thought that this adamant of immunity was particularly important versus humoral. But I understand. That's fine. And then, on the Emory Ridgeback antiviral, could you update us on when we will get data from -- well, I've lost track of -- I think you're running the Phase II, so I think we're pending data from the Phase II. But you tell me, and when we expect to hear? So, this, molecule known as MK-4482 was in licensed and partnered with Ridgeback. This molecule is in a series of Phase II studies. Right now, we have not disclosed any data from those. We are moving ahead into a larger Phase II, III trial. One of these will address an outpatient population, one of these will address inpatient population. And we are optimistic that we will be able to have this up and running the end of September or early October. And how large would that be?  These will be Phase II, III trials, and they will be of significant magnitude. We haven't disclosed the absolute size yet, but that will obviously be posted when these trials come online, and obviously been working with regulators to get agreement on the protocols. The potential data Q1 of -- early part of Q1 2021. Yeah. This will obviously be driven by the rates of enrollment. And clearly, execution of these trials is going to require really top notch on the ground information because as you know, the sort of operates sort of waxes and wanes in different jurisdictions. And so ensuring that you're maximally deployed to enroll patients is going to be pretty important.  Let's just step sideways and talk strategy for a second. So, look, on the basis of Q3 date, you're clearly from not having had a legacy in oncology, you've become the dominant player. Certainly one of the dominant players in this space. The rise of immunology as causal in many non-congenital diseases that aren't oncology, has encouraged many of your peers to intensify their efforts in this space help by a favorable commercial environment. You had some autoimmune drugs, but you divested many of them some years ago. What is the appetite to reengage within autoimmune, either on the biologic side or on the small molecule side? So that's one question. And then in a similar vein, whilst you do have a presence in hematology in Hodgkin's, and now with the acquisition of the ArQule in CLL, it's very small and obviously Bristol Myers, your competitor is dominates that field, and it's still a substantial chunk of the oncology market. So, what's the strategic commitment to increase your footprint in hematology, either through BD organic fleet, so autoimmune and hematology? Right. So, firstly, just to be clear, while we may have divested certain molecules that we saw as being potentially not first-in-class and not necessarily industry leading, we have retained a very substantial discovery efforts in the immunology inflammation areas. So, we've made very access, in the autoimmune and inflammation area. I think the hematology question, just to clarify, actually wasn't BMS that have the hematology profile, is really Celgene. New Bristol. New Bristol. Okay. And having said that, our philosophy has always been one of -- great drugs rather than necessarily cramp up franchises. I think our view is always the great drugs will build great businesses. Great businesses don't always necessarily go great drugs. So, again, our view of the world is, if we come across meaningful targets that look as though they could be first-in-class and have unambiguously large effect sizes, we will build the capability around that.  As you rightly comment, we have a very active position in Hodgkin's and then Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. And that's about the 204, we really quite spectacular. And as you commented we did bring in noncovalent BTK inhibitor, which is looking quite promising and addressing the area of BTK resistant B cell malignancies that have developed specific mutations.  We will continue to look at potentially important first-in-class molecules that are likely to have an ambiguously large effect sizes. So, we don't preclude anything. But the whole idea there is finding great drugs. And just since you mentioned the BTK inhibits, I was with Jake Van Naarden at LOXO who was claiming that the specificity of their molecule results in what they believe is a superior or broader therapeutic window than you see with the RQ molecule. And I was interested in your observations, whether I would be surprised if you agree, but, I'll pause. In God, we trust everyone else. My show data. So, when we see the data, we'll comment.  Very good. All right. So, listen, I think we've reached our allotted time. Roy, always a pleasure, Peter, thank you for joining. And then to investors, thank you for your interest. And if you have any questions, then please email me andrew.baum@citi.com. Next session with Novartis, starts in approximately five minutes. Many thanks to both of you. Have a great week. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, Andrew.
