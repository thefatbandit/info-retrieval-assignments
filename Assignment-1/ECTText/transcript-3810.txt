Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the afternoon sessions here for Virtual Laguna. I'm Josh Pokrzywinski, the firm's U.S. electrical equipment and multi-industry analyst. Joining me for the last of track one for today, great story coming with Otis, I have the C-suite here Judy Marks, President and CEO; Rahul Ghai, CFO. Folks thanks for taking the time here. Just before we jump in, I do need to read a quick disclaimer, and then I'll hand it over to Judy, so she can read her quick disclaimer, and then we can get onto affairs. But please note that this webcast is for Morgan Stanley's clients and appropriate Morgan Stanley employees only. This webcast is not for members of the press. If you are a member of the press, please disconnect and reach out separately. For important disclosures please see Morgan Stanley's research disclose website at morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. If you have any questions, please reach out to your Morgan Stanley's sales representative. With that again, Judy, Rahul, thank you for joining us. I guess just to kick things off Judy, if you wouldn't mind just giving us kind of a lay of the land and any open comments you'd want us to take away. Excellent. Well, I appreciate you taking the time and for some of that – for some of those opening remarks. I guess just to pick up the thread on backlog there, as you mentioned it, we've had a lot of folks with non-residential exposure talk today. And I think the investor sentiment is probably that the sky is falling, but the feedback from companies is not nearly as dire, not really dire at all. You mentioned backlog growth entering the second half. And I know the pricing kind of plays a role as well. So any observations that you would make on the new equipment side, what you're seeing in the marketplace that we are heading for – if we are heading for a deeper non-resi downturn and how that's playing out competitively on price or any other kind of observations that would be relevant to that line of thinking? And then I guess… Please, Rahul… Got it. That's helpful. Is there any way to size how much of that extra backlog conversion you can pull into 2021? Or maybe said differently the disruption in 2020 that goes away and allows you to get after that backlog better? Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, just one market that everyone pays pretty close attention to and will soon be the biggest elevator market in the world, in China. Any observations there on the competitive landscape how pricing trends have laid out there? And then, I guess, there are also some new property rules that went into effect. I know you guys have like your – I’ve got a mislabel like some elevator trade shows symposium, you can tell that I wasn't a new attendance in the past month or so. So any observations that came out of that as well would be helpful. Does that – please Rahul, go ahead. And then I guess on that significant increase in channel partners because it's not a small number, where did that opportunity come from? Were these people waiting in the wings that should have been attacked already? Was that kind of new development that was maybe a little less obvious? Was it taken from competitors? Maybe just kind of touch on how were you able to amass that base so quickly? Is that something that's a bit more of a global trend and I think maybe a good segue into some of the digital initiatives? As these products become smarter, the ISPs just don't really seem like they have the capability to participate in it and they still have the majority of the market. I mean, how do you see that shift happening, especially you mentioned larger customers want that national presence and that sophistication. It seems like there's a lot of wood to chop there. And presumably price is not as much of a discussion at the table when there’s a connect development. And then I guess the other side of some of the digital strategy here would be on new equipment, completely different scenario, but using some different selling tools. You mentioned some of the opportunities in China really being a little bit outside of that. But where have you seen some of the biggest opportunities or success on kind of the new equipment side and digital initiatives there? Got it. And I guess in that more kind of technical environment, does that change the skillset required? I think we’ve seen in some other industries, like the HVAC world, that the difference between the guy who’s changing a filter, tightening of screw and someone who’s doing math in a basement is a pretty wide skill gap. Does the same apply for Otis? And how do you develop some of that talent? And then just pivoting over to the capital allocation side. And Judy, you mentioned, some of the consolidation, kind of organically that has happened in China where the bigger players have gotten bigger and taking a bigger piece of the market. I think some of your past comments that you’ve made and other venues would say that you’re – you don’t really expect a lot of consolidation. Is it just that all these big healthy companies don’t have any kind of pressure to combine? Or is there something else at play here where you’re not expecting a lot of pairing up to happen? And are the targets there that would make the most sense in terms of inorganic investment in field mostly a geographic phenomenon, or is there some other technical priority that could exist out there? Got it. And then I guess on the service side understanding that you have a big service market in the brake service business in Europe that just went through, probably not as sharp of a recovery is what you saw in China, anything on the service book that is now locked in a little bit weaker in terms of contract pricing, or did you see just kind of more transactional stuff flash in the pan and you can kind of get back to normal quickly. Got it. Got it. And then I guess, what have been some of the biggest supply chain and other cost-based initiatives with independence from UTX. Clearly a lot of customer facing changes that you’ve been able to make, but anything on the manufacturing or procurement side? Excellent. And I have one question here as we wrap up coming in from the portal. Any impact from shipping elevators to China with IoT in the third quarter that we should think about from a margin perspective? Got it. Got it. And then final question, any seasonal differences or shifts in normal seasonality as in, will services be bigger in the fourth quarter as a function of maybe some of the delays earlier in the year? Excellent. Judy, Rahul. Appreciate the time. Great having you, give your time for us for the conference here and looking forward to doing it on the beach in 2021.  Thanks. You are welcome.Great. Thanks, Josh. Rahul and I are both excited to be here with you. Let me just read my disclosure. Please note, except or otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other significant items. The company will also refer to adjusted results where adjustments were made as though Otis was a standalone company in Q1 2020 and prior year. A reconciliation of these measures can be found on the company's website. We also remind listeners that this discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including its registration statement on Form 10 and its Form 10-Qs, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Well, thanks again for having us join you. And this is certainly an exciting year for Otis faced with opportunities, faced with challenges and I just couldn't be more proud of how our team has performed. As we've come through the first half, I think the most important takeaway we have is how resilient our service business continues to be even in the face of COVID. It was efficient. Our teams performed, we had productivity and we really did provide essential services globally and kept the world moving despite other distractions. As you look at how we came through the first half, Josh, we were down 4% organically on the top-line, but we still had 70 basis points of margin expansion as we focused on cost, as we focused on productivity and as we delivered services effectively and efficiently. That's what gives us real confidence and allowed us in our second quarter earnings to improve our outlook for the year. We took up our outlook on sales, on EBIT and on cash flow as well as EPS. And cash flow story in the second quarter was very strong and helped us really now have $1.9 billion of cash balance after generating $628 million of free cash flow, 280% of net income, which just again justifies what a strong cash flow business Otis is. So we took up our guidance and EPS. We took it up on free cash flow. And it also gave us the flexibility to delever. And so, part of our capital allocation model has been focused on returning value to our shareholders while honoring our commitments and commitments to the rating agencies. And so, we're actually going to pay down more debt in 2020 than we had originally planned. That allows us to pay the remainder in early 2021 and accelerating the 2021 potential for a share repurchase plan. So we're excited about the business. It's a long cycle life safety business. Our backlog is strong at $16.3 billion. We ended the second half again with backlog improving our new equipment business. As I look at it really gives us the 12 to 18 month range of backlog to where we really feel we've got a good sense on price. We've got a good sense on where things are going for 2021. Obviously, price will be driven more by the market, but we know how to drive productivity and drive costs. So, again, it's an exciting time for us. It was just early April. We spun to our independence and really looking forward to having this discussion. Yes. I know I always start by putting context in our service business is 57% of our revenue and 80% of our profit and that's tremendously resilient. And we build off of that. On the new equipment side, again, and we shared this at our second quarter earnings. More than 50% of our business is residential globally. The non-resi impact is primarily felt here in North America. But as we look at our end markets, hospitality and retail is about 10%, even office is a little over 10%. So we've got a nice blend. Our product fits in every one of our end markets. So we don't have this unique product portfolio. So our manufacturing and our ability to install us is not inhibited. Well, we've been challenged by in new equipment today is really job site access in terms of our revenue. But on the pricing side, before the second quarter and pricing is lumpy – I'm sorry, orders are lumpy. But before the second quarter, we had experienced five to six straight quarters of price. And throughout 2019, where we had $100 million of earnings growth, we had every one of those quarters we were able to get price in every one of our regions. China goes back to six quarters. Normally, we'd look at the second quarter and say it's not a trend because we did – our backlog margins were down about 70 basis points, but in light of the macroeconomic headwinds we're seeing, we're really taking pause and making sure we understand what's in our backlog, how do we finish 2020 and most importantly how do we perform in 2021. I want to talk about backlog conversion for a minute, and then I'll turn it over to Rahul if he has anything to add. But we have converted less backlog this year because of lack of access to job sites, as well as other intermitting challenges with crews who potentially test positive, we have to replace the crews. We haven't been as efficient as we could be globally. Next year, our intent is to go in and continue this year to try and build backlog. But even if we go in flat, we have the ability to convert more backlogs. We're not a book and ship business in our new equipment market. We're long cycle, 12 to 18 months. So we know what to do. Any of the orders we took in, in the second quarter, we have the ability through material productivity and other cost controls to be able to make sure that that price impact doesn't see the bottom line. So we're excited about 2021 and we think that we have the ability to control those costs and we'll handle price as it comes up. We'll handle it with productivity and we'll handle it before it actually hits the factory and then before it gets installed. The China market is back. It's snapped back really strong in Q2 versus Q1. All four of the segments we compete in, in China, residential, commercial, office and infrastructure, we had share gain in all four of those in the second quarter. So our China business is doing well. And it will be the segment itself in China will be down a little this year because of the first quarter, but we have predicted it would be a down segment, which is why we went after getting share. In terms of price, as I said earlier, we've seen six straight quarters of price that we're coming off of in China. And so, our booked margin in China for Q2 was flattish, but we are seeing competition there, especially on some of the infrastructure bids, but we have a great share on infrastructure and we're going to continue, especially as airports, rail and metros continue to grow, which they are in China, we expect to continue to yield there. We're going to continue to be competitive. If you go back to 2015 on the new equipment side, the top 10 OEMs really had 70% market share. As we exited 2019 that was down to – it was up to 90% market share. So we don't see a rational pricing in China, all 10 are basically public companies, majority of them now. And so, we're seeing rational pricing and a little smaller segment and we're going to – we gain share and we're going to continue to gain share. Yes. It's a little bit of all of them. I mean, we've expanded our reach now in the tier 5 and tier 6 cities that before we just hadn't been able to address. It was a much more lengthy process as part of the portfolio company. We've streamlined the process where we now have great distribution in terms of these agents and distributors. The other area we really focused on is enhancing relationships with the key developers. We call them key accounts. They've continued to consolidate and continue to be major players in China. There's a twofold benefit for us. One is the volume on the new equipment side. But the second, these large companies want a business partner to be their national service partner for these units. So we get better conversion rates, better retention rates and more predictability. There’s so much opportunity. In our world, once you’re connected, the connected elevator, it just defines an ecosystem where you can drive tremendous value-add for your customers and productivity for Otis. And so we look to that whether that connection is through IoT, through – again, through all of the Otis portfolio that has been manufactured, whether it’s in our service portfolio or not. If there’s an Otis controller and elevator, we have unique access to the brains, the fault codes, the traffic management, really understanding that the flow of the elevator and what’s happening with it. Independently that’s interesting for one elevator, but when you think of the data like we have and are able to create and the data analytics we can do, it lets us be far more predictive, far more transparent and share that information with our customers. When we connect, Josh, whether it’s through our destination dispatch system we call Compass, whether that’s through having a screen inside a cab, whether that’s through an IoT sensor, our ability to attract a customer goes off, our ability to convert that customer from just buying and having our units installed to a service contract goes up significantly, and then our ability to retain that customer that goes off. I’ll just give you one example, in Spain, where we have about a 250,000 unit portfolio over a third of those units are connected via IoT devices and are – both our conversion rate and our retention rate instead of our national – our global retention rate of 93% is in the high 90s, 98%, 99%. The customer gets value. They can see if their elevators up and running, they can see it. If they’re doing a campus or a building manager, we get value and productivity and we get the knock-on important value and the stickiness and retention. Exactly. It’s our value proposition that that really does have the customer wanting to do business with you for the long term. Yes, so we’ve got a couple of digital initiatives going, we’ve really accelerated our digital marketing so that we have the ability to create a much better funnel for our sales personnel, to be able to get qualified leads. We have our Otis Create available on otis.com website that lets you configure an elevator like you would configure buying a car, and then it transfers it to a BIM model, so that we can get spec position and spec preference. So we’re making all those tools earlier and chat tools availability to our experts. And I think we learned through COVID when a lot of our sales personnel were working remotely, that it’s not always that face-to-face contact. It’s that ability to provide multichannel access to our information. So we’ve really focused there. The second, though, is we continue to innovate. No matter what we did on driving SG&A down on cost containment this year, we never decreased our R&D or our digital spend. This is the difference as a focused company. We understand where we’re going. We understand our roadmap and we understand I have to have consistent investment for the future. So we’ve started piloting our GEN360, our digitally native new elevator in Europe with incredible functions that it offers both in terms of for passengers, for our mechanics, as well as an electronic safety, first really accepted electronic safety since Elisha Otis invented safety break 167 plus years ago. So we’re revolutionizing the connection there with multimedia, the ability if you do to have a graceful degradation, if there’s an issue on an elevator to gets you to stop on a floor, as opposed to in between floors, just again, progress there to be totally connected. And then our health solutions that we came out with, as a result of COVID, we had our destination dispatch and our ability to have an app we call eCall to be able to call the elevator. But now we have gesturing, now we have voice in Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut, we’re piloting, “Hey, Otis, would you walk up to the elevator, take me off” and it connects and it likes the up button. So that whether it’s purification fans, the team has become very agile, never forgetting our role in life safety, but very agile and bringing new solutions to market. Our field professionals, we’ve got about 33,000 who do service and other 7,000 do installation are our true skilled craftsmen and craftswomen. And we have spent the past multiple years really training them, developing apps, giving all of them iPhones. So they have the ability to access parts catalogs. They have the ability to talk to each other over Yammer and we have a virtual expert app. So if they get to an elevator and it may not be an Otis elevator, because we maintain other OEM elevators that they’ve not seen this problem for. They can call in a virtual experts through this app who’s through the phone can actually circle what they have to do or tell them what to focus on. But our field force has responded wonderfully to the technology and has become far more productive as well and enjoys learning more about electronics. There’s a few items in play. One is clearly regulatory. When you look at certain countries, certain markets based on market share, if you get into situations where it just would not be feasible or allowed, it’s a fairly consolidated industry right now, and we’ve seen it most in China since things started hitting some challenges in 2015 that drove us to transform our own business down from four brands to two, we’ve gotten rid of two factories. Although this year alone, we’ve invested in a new escalator factory just last quarter by an industry 4.0 factory in China. So I think you’re going to see continue on the service side. That’s part of our capital allocation strategy. We’ve set aside roughly $50 million a year for a niche kind of bolt on service portfolio M&A. And we actually announced our first one that was pretty significant Bay State, headquartered in Massachusetts. We just acquired them in the past few months and it’s a great fit for us. It gives us again, more reach, more field and craft professionals, and we’re going to continue to see where we can continue to add value in growing our service portfolio both organically and inorganically. So we have a few criteria, one is we want it to be accretive as soon as possible, no later than year two. We’ve got a lot of experience doing this and we take it in places where we know we can blend it with an existing network and make our route more efficient, where we can drive the synergies. And we’ve proven that in Western Europe. We’ve proven that in the U.S. When a large service portfolio comes along, we don’t shy away from it. We bought Schindler’s portfolio in Japan. We’ve won Mitsubishi’s in Brazil. We’re always out there looking. So we report servicing as a segment in two parts, one is maintenance and repair, the second is modernization. Our maintenance business is contractual, and we were able to get priced in first quarter, pretty much across the globe. And so we’re still, we’ve not missed on price and service. Obviously watching that closely, I would say what kind of flattish as we come out of the second quarter for service pricing. We’re going to watch that in terms of – but in repair and modernization, some of that’s more discretionary and where we couldn’t get in a facility to be able to provide repair. Obviously, we’re going to try, and if you look at our guidance for the rest of the year, our repair business we expect to pick up in Q3 and progressively even more in Q4. Our modernization business actually was very strong in the first quarter and actually didn’t do too poorly in the second quarter. We’ve got some regulatory modernization activity going on in Asia, specifically in Korea, lots of aging buildings in Japan. But in modernization, some of it is discretionary in terms of aesthetics versus technology. And then in Europe, where we do a lot of modernization and 3.5 million buildings or at least 3 million buildings are over 20 years old the elevators. We have more than half of that’s residential to us. So we need those annual condominium meetings to happen. They’ve been put off because of COVID, but that’s where they make the buying decisions. So we’ve seen a little bit of delay, especially in Europe on modernization. Don’t think its disruption, but just delay. Yes. We have been laser focused on material productivity. And when we had our Investor Day, Josh, we said that we were going to be able to compensate for any price impact out of our factories with material productivity. And we’ve proven that in both Q1 and Q2, we had very significant material productivity. I think at Investor Day, we would have hoped that pricing on new equipment, maybe that would have happened an issue or headwinds would have been in 2021 or 2022. But if they’re upon us, we’ve only had one quarter of it. If they’re upon us, we’ve got a long cycle, we know what the backlog is, and we’re going to drive productivity.  Our commodities, we’re watching – the majority of our commodity spend is on stainless steel and we spent about $300 million a year on commodities. So we’re going to watch that. We’ve got the next six months locked in. We know every lever we need to control. And the last lever on new equipment is the installation process and getting productivity out of that. And we’ve got quite a few initiatives focusing. Our elevators that we manufacture in China for the China market, we’ve got four factories in China that source locally and including the IoT sensors that we use in China, we get manufactured in China. So there’s no impact. Thanks, Josh.Judy, I think… Yes. So, Josh, I think Judy hit on a really important point for us, which is backlog conversion. So as she said there were a lot of disruptions this year both in accessing the job sites and even in the factory site, our factories are open today, but we've had periods where they've been short because of supply chain issues or because of somebody contracting COVID within our factory. So we've gone through those disruptions. But if our backlog is flat by the time we end this year, we should be able to accelerate the backlog conversion into next year. And that reduces our volume related headwind that we experienced this year. So that I think is a critical component for us. They're having full access to job sites. Factories working normally, supply chain performing the way they should, we should be able to accelerate our backlog conversion. That's a big tailwind for us getting into next year with everything year that we have seen this year. So that's one. I think the second point that you made on the macroeconomic environment everything that we are reading today is that the construction industry should snap back after a fairly sharp decline this year. So if you can navigate next year by just accelerating our backlog conversion, then our backlog color [ph] to start rebuilding for 2022 and 2021. And that helps us navigate this multi-year span with next year managing through accelerated backlog conversion, and then 2022 working off the growth that we'll hopefully see in backlog next year. So that's what we're kind of focused on right now to drive a continued earnings momentum. Yes, I think, typically what we see is about two thirds of our new equipment revenue comes from backlog, right. And our backlog is around $6.5-ish billion on new equipment backlog. So that's the way to size it. And this year it's down. So we're not able to get to the 66%. And our goal is not only to get back to the two thirds level that we saw in 2019, but even go beyond that. So, we've got room to maybe fact that by a few points. So that's what we're going to work on, work that $6.5-ish billion of backlog and just continuing to drive new equipment growth from that backlog next year. Sure. Yes, just to add to Judy's point on share gain. I think China has been a huge success for us going all the way back 2015, between 2015 and 2019, we gained maybe a point and a half of a share overall. But what we've also seen, what we've done this year is we've added about 500 channel partners with China. And that has allowed us to increase our coverage of the China market by about 10 points roughly. And so that's the part of the stealth health story about Otis that is so critical, not just for China but globally. So the fact that Judy mentioned a couple of points – in a couple of times that we've gained about 100 basis points of share in the first half of the year. And that's coming from steps like this that we've taken in China, where we've added 500 channel partners on a base of about 1,100. And this has happened since the end of last year and primarily since we spun from UTC. So that's the part that we were an under managed under invested asset under UTC. And this, becoming an independent company, allows us to drive all the things that are critical for us. And globally, we focused on a few things around gaining share, which is increasing our sales coverage, making sure our sales performance of our salespeople is up to mark, introducing new products. And all that, that all contributes to the self-help that Otis can do even if the end markets kind of stay challenged. That's what we are focused on internally in terms of driving the top-line growth. The other thing, Josh, I want to add to the service discussion here is that, again, the same comments that Judy made earlier on new equipment more than apply to service, because if you look at our first half service results, our service margin through the first half are up 90 basis points. And our earnings are up even the revenues down. And the reason we’ve been able to do that, it’s just our laser focused on productivity. And that started a few years ago, and that has just been down on that in an environment like this. So if you look at – in the couple of metrics you’ve watch there are the number of visits we make and the hours per visit. So if you look at the number of visits that we make, they’re down about 3% between 2017 and 2019. The hours per unit are down almost 4% between the last couple of years. So that – and that has only accelerated this year as we face some revenue challenges. So that is what gives us confidence that, again, the service and pricing environment has been very, very stable. And we enjoyed that, especially in Europe, which has been a headwind over the last several years. We actually gained a little bit of price in 2018. We got two points last year on revenue per unit. And as Judy said, we’ve been able to get service pricing improvement both in Q1 and Q2. So even though the pricing environment is very stable, the fact is that by focusing on productivity, we are ready for any macroeconomic issues that we may get. So far, it’s been very stable, but our productivity initiatives are more than delivering what they need to deliver. If the question, Josh, is around pricing, the fact is we have not baked in any incremental pricing benefit from the IoT, either on the field side or on the new equipment. So we’re going to test the market. Right now, our focus in China, the new units that we’re going to ship with IoT is in the tier 1, tier 2 cities, and we are going to watch that very carefully, improvement in pricing is not part of our thesis, but we obviously are going to try for that. So let’s see how the – let’s see how the initial reaction is, and maybe we surprised on the upside, but that’s not part of our guidance. So we’re not expecting any price improvement on the new units that we’re going to ship with IoT, but we’re not going to give up on that on pricing just yet some more to come. The only thing that we’ve said previously, Josh, is that we do expect our repair business to be a little bit stronger than Q4 over Q3. And that’s not by the seasonality as much as tied to people returning to work and the building occupancy improving, because – as you would expect, the more you use an elevator, the more break fix work we get. So our repair business was soft in Q2. As building shutdown, but as people return to work in Q3 and Q4, we would expect the repair business to come back more to normal. And we’ve already seen that in the trends in July and August are better than they were in Q2, and we expect continued improvement in Q4. Thanks, Josh.
