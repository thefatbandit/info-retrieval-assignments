Hi, my name is Atif Malik. I cover U.S. semiconductors and equipment stocks at Citi. It’s my pleasure to welcome Bob Bruggeworth, CEO of Qorvo; Mark Murphy, CFO; and James Klein, President of Infrastructure and Defense Product Group. Mark and Bob are going to go over an update for us on the September quarter. And then I’ll go back to the Q&A. Mark? Actually, thanks, Atif. And I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Although it's virtual, we do appreciate it. I also want to remind everyone that our Safe Harbor language that accompanies our press release applies to our comments today. I'll make a few high level comments and then make sure we have plenty of time for discussion and Q&A. About an hour ago, we issued a quarterly financial update. If you've not had a chance to look at it, we would suggest you do so.  During the September quarter, mobile demand has been stronger than we expected. The team is executing extremely well, and we continue to be pleased with our operating performance. As we have laid out before, Qorvo is innovating, investing in the technologies our markets need. We’re actively managing our portfolio to sustain leadership where Qorvo is best positioned to serve our customers. We are driving productivity, reducing capital intensity, and we are delivering the cutting edge technologies our customers need at scale, and with industry-leading quality. We are a critical supplier into the 5G, Wi-Fi, IoT, defense and other growth markets. And we are delivering a model to grow revenue, expand margins and drive free cash flow in the future and the long-term. Finally, we are serving our customers extremely well as our quarterly update today demonstrates.  So with that, Atif, I'll turn it back over to you for any housekeeping questions you may have, and hopefully we'll get into a lot of great questions with our audience and cover our IDP business that’s doing extremely well.  Thank you, Bob, and James is the star of our fireside chat today. But just on that positive pre-announcement for the September quarter, if you can talk about what you saw in the mobile demand? Did you see more of the same that the China's strength in the low, mid end tiers was stronger than what you expected? And if you can also talk about what you're seeing with the whole Huawei demand shifting to some of the other competitors like Samsung or other competitors in China. Are you still seeing an upside from that demand? As far as what we're seeing in mobile, it's across all of our mobile customers, except Huawei But I think right now, I would say that we haven't seen the impacts of some of the trade restrictions on Huawei yet in their end products. I mean, clearly, they’ve had inventory and have been building. I think if you look a little bit further out, clearly they're not going to be able to continue to build foams and you will start to see share shifts around the world really because Huawei primarily was in China and they had already pulled back a fair amount out of Europe. So -- and we're seeing it. Currently some of that is the return of the overseas markets for some of our Chinese customers, along with the [map] here at Samsung. But I want to make sure you understand it, it's across all our customer base in mobile except for Huawei. Go ahead, Mark. Yes, I would just add that we have been clear in our story, and that's been a risk in our business that we've been very transparent about and indicated clearly that Huawei we expected to be 5% or less of our business on any given quarter going forward. That includes September. That statement has not changed. With the exception of fact, obviously with the additional restrictions beyond the September quarter, we've not factored in -- the numbers that we talked about today, we will not factor in Huawei. However, the broader statement we've made about how we see the markets moving if Huawei is unable to shift premium tier phones, that shift and share will go to others which were well represented. And again, I want to emphasize that this update in guidance we've provided is not driven by Huawei. It's broad-based across our mobile customer base. Got it, Mark. Now I won’t to put you in the spot, but I think on the last earning call, you talked about December quarter also growing for mobile sequentially, partly because of a public delayed launch of flagship phone. Do you want to make any comments on December right now, or are you good for September? Yes, I mean, let me flush out September a bit and [Technical Difficulty] December since I did last quarter. I think it's only fair. Again, I think there's some consistency, hopefully, you're seeing in our message. We said in June that, we saw strong demand across multiple markets, and that started with 5G infrastructure handsets, but it was even broader than that, and we were able to intersect that demand as you saw in the June quarter in a very challenging environment. We said that we expected more of the same in the September quarter. And just to be candid, it just exceeded our expectations here. It's been much stronger on the mobile side specifically. And again, across the customer base. So very healthy, robust demand. The September quarter even adjusting for the additional week -- and if you want to go back and look at the transcript, we went into discussion about the additional week we have in this fiscal quarter, even with the fiscal week adjusted, which is about [$72 million] in this case, it's still a strong quarter, it’s over $940 million. I mean, coincidentally it’s adjusted, it's about what our previous guidance was for the September quarter, and that's up 20% sequentially, if you adjust the number to $943 million, and at 17% year-over-year.  In IDP, we expect to be slightly under $300 million for the September quarter, timing of installs, product rollouts and so forth. But, if we adjust for the additional weeks, that numbers around $280 million, maybe a little bit below that. And we would expect -- consistent with what we said in the June quarter, we expect the December quarter to be down a bit from that, again due to timing of installs and product launches and so forth. But as we see it now, IDP is going to have an exceptional year based on what transpired so far and what we see the rest of the year. So, a well over $1 billion business run rate for the company.  On the mobile side, in the September quarter, we expect revenue to be about $720 million or again adjusted for the additional week, $670 million, and that would be up 40% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. Again, uncertain times. But as we sit now and assess the health of our channels, and the strength of 5G, we see December quarter in mobile to be flattish. Hard -- again, hard to call at this point. So, if we look at IDP being down a bit sequentially September to December -- and I'm talking adjusted numbers of course and not absolute, it would be down of course. So, if we see IDP being down on an adjusted basis, and then mobile being flattish, I think you could see revenue in the $900 million to $940 million range in the December quarter. And again, that's somewhat consistent with the guidance we gave previously. Mark, on the gross margins you’ve maintained the 50% outlook for September and any takeaways on the gross margin line from the upside in September on the top-line? Yes. Of course, we're continuously accelerating the gross margin. It's a great -- area of great focus for the company and we constantly are reassessing mix and absorption and other factors. I'm pleased to say and you see this in our update today, we're maintaining a 50% gross margin outlook, puts and takes relative to our last forecast, of course on the negative side, the stronger mobile volumes bring slightly unfavorable mix relative to IDP. So that stronger mobile has weighed on margins a bit relative to our last guide. On the other hand, we're seeing very good factory performance and absorption based on the higher volume. So, the puts and takes we see in forecast it’s about the same on gross margin. And again, we -- as I said in the June quarter call, we -- as of now, what we see rest of year, we expect to be able to sustain that gross margin level. So nothing has changed there. I will though add, since we're kind of running through the P&L here, I do want to make sure there's an adjustment for folks on OpEx. You won't be able to get to the $2.14 EPS without this increase. We are looking at higher OpEx in the quarter. We guided to $2.07, we’re looking around $2.14. That's combination of labor costs and product development spend and so forth. And in the rest of the year, we see -- we now see OpEx running at about $200 million per quarter in the second half of our fiscal year, when before I said about $196 million. So a little bit higher OpEx reflecting some labor costs and then just continued investment in the business and a lot of good opportunities we see.  Great. I think we can move to James to talk about the IDP business, but really appreciate that update Bob and Mark. James, if we just focus on the September quarter kind of near term, like Mark said a little below $300 million but still double-digit year-over-year growth in September quarter. IDP business has been a huge success story, I might have dozed off, it's like one-third of your sales now. Can you just talk about your expectations for the number of global base stations this year and next year? I think we're going to stay the course for what we've projected in the past. We talked about three quarters of a million base stations to be deployed in 2020. And we do see that number increasing as we go into next year, mostly driven by China deployments, both this year and next year. Now I will say the latest round of Huawei sanctions may have some impact on deployments in China, but I think it's a bit too early for us to really try to call that. As a footnote though, as we see any shifts away from Huawei to the other OEMs that are supplying into that marketplace, like ZTE or Ericsson, those will be positive for Qorvo. So I think right now a little bit too early to see how it works out with Huawei and any shift that would come away from Huawei into the other players should be a positive impact for us.  And next year you're also looking at the 20% plus growth number? Yes, yes, absolutely. And again exactly what frequencies and what configurations that get deployed, I think it's still a bit early. But yes, we are still expecting a ramp in the rollout. And again, predominantly driven by the deployments in China and the start of some deployments in U.S.  Great, and then you have talked about a 10x dollar content gained from $100 to $150 in 5G base stations driven by multiple antenna counts. Can you talk about the specific demand areas where Qorvo is strong? Yes. First of all that 10x number, it’s an approximate number and it really depends on the antenna configuration. So, on a 64 element antenna as an example, our content gains can actually be a bit higher than 10x. On the 32, obviously they could be a bit lower. And so again, that's sort of an approximate number of significant amount, probably over half of our content gain is just the addition to the PA side. So with GaN really being adopted in this marketplace really by all the major early OEMs, that brings effectively a large adder to what we're able to service in the market. And so, we continue to pursue those slots, and specifically when it's greater than 2 gigahertz, we think that's sweet spot. So, we're going to continue to drive for that.  Now, that said, we've also got a very nice, robust business in small signal. And of course, if you go from a normal macro that maybe has any channels to 32 or 64 element array, you also get a significant content improvement on the small single side. And we've got a market leading products on the small single side as well. Great examples are our low noise amplifiers, which we believe sort of sets the standard in the industry for performance. And James, who are the competitors on the PA socket size for you for the base station? Well, I think, we're pretty aligned to what you see in most of the analyst reports where Sumitomo has been in the market for a long period of time with their products in GaN, and then, of course creased in there with us as well. And then we have the more traditional LDMOS players that are in the market -- have been in the market for a while, so Ampleon, NXP, things like that. The way I look at the market, again is, if it's over 2 gigahertz, it's going to tilt towards GaN. If it's below 2 gigahertz, it typically tilts towards LDMOS. Okay. And on the GaN side, last week China put out this update that they want to focus on the third generation of semiconductors, silicon carbide, gallium nitride. Can you talk about the barriers to entry in the GaN market and if there is reason to be worried about some of the domestic players in the China market? Well, I'll tell you about our journey. We started developing GaN I guess just a bit more than 20 years ago with a real focus initially on of being able to demonstrate reliability. So, I would say sort of that first barrier is to be able to build a process that has long life, very reliable performance, and we certainly have achieved that with our gallium nitride. The second was really to be able to ramp it up into production and be able to produce the kind of volumes that you need to produce, especially for some of these commercial type products that you're talking about. And so we've also -- and you certainly have noticed last quarter and this current quarter in, we have been able to get up that production curve and be able to produce the technology and volume. You also need a healthy supply chain. I think we've been very focused on making sure we have that as well, and that's all part of scale. Now, I didn't mention performance. But I will tell you that we win and lose these slots based on just a very few points of efficiency, just a very few points of our [VBs] or getting things like that. So, it is also very much performance driven market. So, I think you got to get the fundamental technology right, you got to be able to scale it and then you need world-class performance on top of that. So, I would say, still pretty good barriers, we've been doing for 20 years. And you probably think about design as well and techniques. Oh, that’s true. Yes. Thanks, Bob. That's a good point. We -- to be able to design certainly in this environment, and I talked about base station, you really need world-class Doherty design expertise to be able to hit the demands of this market, and those demands are basically a highly efficient power amplifier working over a broad range of loads and a broad range of environmental conditions as well. So, we've also been focused pretty intently over the last several years of being able to design those Doherties. Of course, you need low cost packaging as well that performs very well at these frequencies. So, certainly a lot of barriers to be able to do all those things and certainly seen RF design be a challenge for a lot of folks and some that we've mastered over all the years.  Now as you move into other markets like our defense business, the barriers get even higher as you can imagine. One, because you move into much broader and higher frequency ranges and of course you have many other restrictions about where the work can be done, and who can do the work, that add to those barriers to entry into that part of the market. Then can you talk about the defense portion of IDP business, how big is it? You have called this is an asset to the defense department. Just talk about the current portfolio? Yes, so the size of the business, as I said before, defense represents about a quarter of IDP and little ebb and flow a bit depending on some of our big multiyear contracts. But I think it is generally correct to talk about it being about a quarter of IDP. We've been in this business and supported this market with a broad set of portfolio products for several decades. We have products that go all the way from sub 1 gigahertz up to almost 100 gigahertz and we support virtually the entire RF chain, whether it’s transmit side, receive side, a broad, broad set of products. And so I think when we talk about diversification inside IDP, this is kind of the poster child for being diversified, it's the defense business.  Now, I also want to talk about growth in the defense business. If you look at -- since we formed the company, IDP has grown at a CAGR sort of in that mid low teens, right, somewhere between 10% and 15%. And that's even with the down year last year because of the Huawei ban. So, we had a pretty good run of growth since we formed the company. The defense business is actually just slightly above the growth rate of the overall IDP. So, I do want people to understand that we -- it is not just a great stable business for us, it's also a great growing business for us.  Now, why is it growing? It's very similar what we've seen base station. We've got very good underlying trends in the defense business with the adoption of, in that market what’s called phased arrays, what we call massive MIMO in the base station market. So, we got a big content uplift. And on top of that we've got the adoption of GaN going on in the defense space, just like we do in other markets. So, really good underlying trends that allow us to capture that business.  Great. And James on the base station infrastructure side, when do you expect the millimeter wave part of the base stations to kind to roll out and how would that impact your business? Yes, I would say we -- for millimeter wave, I think it's still a bit early in the deployments. And I would say it’s still a bit unclear whether there will be massive millimeter wave deployments, really I think dependent on what the adoption rate looks like in the foam. We are certainly positioning ourselves with technology to be available. If that ramps I think most folks know that we start to participate in the early millimeter wave deployment. So I would say it's pretty early in. And, we will be ready with technology as it moves forward, particularly with GaN, I think GaN will offer a significant performance improvement just like it has in other areas. So once millimeter wave starts to take off we think GaN will start to take off.  Now that said, what we're really focused on that market is the China deployments and then we're getting ready for C-band deployments in the U.S. Auctions are coming up later this year. There was an initial auction recently. And we want to make sure that we're ready for those deployments in the U.S. and this is in the higher part of the 3 gigahertz bands. And so we've been out sampling products. We're designing record with several OEMs in those frequency bands, including some very key ones. So we want to make sure that we're positioned -- just like we were for China deployments, we want to make sure that we're positioned for U.S. deployments.  And James, is there a reason to believe you can take the knowhow on GaN and massive MIMO to Eric’s business on the mobile side as we move into wave or a lot of this is separate from mobile?  Yes, I think right now the move, GaN to mobile is probably a bit early on whether that technology will play there or not. But certainly millimeter, wave we've got the technology in the mobile space to service the millimeter wave market. And we'll do that with the combination of gas and some of the silicon processes. But we -- again, we've been in the millimeter wave space for years and years and years inside IDP and I think we've got the foundational technology to apply to both mobile and the IDP markets in those frequency ranges.  Okay. And I have a question on the mobile side, maybe Mark or Bob can jump in. But we hear Huawei demand shifting to MediaTek modems where you have a very strong position on [Space-6] platform which should be a tailwind for you guys into next year. Can you talk about the share shift with respect to Samsung which historically has been a lower content that customer call for Qorvo and if Samsung let’s say gains share at the expense of Huawei. What does that mean for your mobile business next year?  I understood the second part of the question, the first part wasn’t clear to me. Yes, the first part Bob is like, is if there is a demand that is growing because of anticipation that the MediaTek modem is going to get adopted in Huawei phones. And at some point that demand is going to come down, because those shared aspirations might not come out for Huawei and might go to someone else. So, I mean, in terms of the normalization from the Huawei ban, which is -- which ends on like September 14th or something in terms of component procurement, is there kind of a near term effect where the demand is -- it's kind of a, I don't want to use those words, like, double ordering or something, is the demand more than the longer term run rate?  I think maybe just to start, there's really nothing has changed in what we've said for well over a year now since the original restrictions were put in place. We've been serving all our customers with the technologies that they need, that we're best positioned to provide value to them on, which includes Huawei as long as we can sell to them legally, which we've been able to do principally on the mobile side here at least through the 14th of September. That continues today. We seek out and go to customers where we're strongest -- play our strongest hand on technology, which we're fortunate because we've got the broadest portfolio and we're a leader in a number of different devices. As it relates to share shift and what happens with basebands or customers, we're well-positioned on any baseband, and that's part of the advantage of an open RF environment where we can compete with the best technologies and we believe we'll win. And then to the extent that a customer is unable to field a top of the line phone and consumers demand that to electronic space, that share will go to other handset makers. And again, in the premium care handset market we're very well-positioned across the customer base, whether that’s Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Samsung. Yes. The only thing I’d to add to that, just to be clear. We make the same parts and I'll pick on your comment about MediaTek. I'll use [Space 7] as an example that we're releasing, that works across all basebands, whether it’s Qualcomm, MediaTek, SLSI and prior HiSilicon which as you know with the government bans will matter. But clearly, in the mass tier part of Huawei we weren't participating. So if that goes to Samsung, Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, yes, we've been able to play there, to Mark's point, and upgrade technology across whatever baseband they use, SLSI, MediaTek or Qualcomm. We're prepared wherever this goes. That's been our goal to be very diversified across. That makes sense. In terms of your content growth, Bob, as you moved from 4.5 G to sub 6 gigahertz, and then to millimeter wave, how should we think about your content growth during those transitions? We have been very consistent in that $5 to $7 across various tiers, even the mid-tier almost doubling in the dollar content. So, we're seeing that. The key is, all the integration that we're able to offer those customers of integrating in all the filters to best switch performance, the best PA performance, all that in a small package shielded. And we've talked about how we’ve won the low band to mid high band and the high band, because we're able to do all that, and it's very easy for them to implement because it's quite challenging as you add all these different frequency bands to get all these parts to work well together. So, it's been very consistent with $5 to $7 across the portfolio. I would just add that, because you brought it up Atif, just to comment about millimeter wave. Now, as Bob talked about, we see $5 to $7 of content. We see that largest volumes by far being in the sub 6 gigahertz as it applies to 5G. The rollout in China is clear. The U.S. we see carrier scrambling to get that subsets so they can build out their network sufficiently and then Europe is clear. So -- and you heard James earlier talking about from an infrastructure standpoint, he is not planning on big millimeter wave infrastructure deployment. So, having said that, it is higher content, a chunky module a lot in there, it’s just going to be very low volume we believe. But to James' point, and as Bob said, it does take off and exceed people's expectations, we’re very well positioned. I can't think of anybody …  We've worked with several baseband manufacturers already with their chipsets and things like that, to James' point. It was the advanced R&D for the mobile business in millimeter wave and we're just waiting but we'll see what happens. But if it happens, we're ready.  Great. I have received a few questions from the audience via e-mail. The first question, for fiscal Q3 did the $900 million to $940 million factored in additional Huawei restriction? Well, you're talking for the December quarter.  Right, right.  Yes, so December quarter contemplates the current restrictions in Huawei.  Great. And then I have one for James. There have been reports on China making renewed efforts to design out American components in a Huawei [NBT] base station. Can you comment on that?  Well, again, I think, as I talked about earlier, the markets are certainly driven by technology and performance. And I think what we've continue to focused on is making sure that we've got the highest performing products out there in the market with demonstrated reliability and really demonstrated scale. I think the ability to get to these kind of rollouts like we've seen this year and we'll see for the next several years in 5G is going to take a substantial amount of scale. Just like we saw in the 4G rollouts it took a substantial amount of scale, we think that's going to happen as well in 5G. So, we're going to make sure we're there with great products, with great reliability and with tremendous scale to be able to support it and sound pretty confident that, that recipe is going to work.  And we've got great relationships in China. We've spent a tremendous amount of energy as a company and as a business in building those relationships in-country and certainly have significant capabilities there. So, again, I think we're in pretty good position.  And then one quick clarification, if the upside to September quarter was contributed by Huawei, I think you had said it was fairly broad-based. Correct, Mark?  That was no Huawei. Yes, the update in the September quarter was not driven by Huawei. It was broad-based. And statements we made about Huawei’s mix in our business, those statements are consistent. It's 5% or less.  No change.  Okay, I think this is more for Eric but someone is asking if you can compare your ball performance with Q-SAW technology that Qualcomm is ramping? That's okay if…  What -- I think our product performance and updating our guidance for September and December speaks to the performance of our BAW filters, and many of those are on our customers’ products that are using Qualcomm basebands.  Yes, I would maybe add that, we have all acoustic filtering technologies and where this -- if you look across the spectrum, we've got the broadest portfolio and highest average competency across the technology. So we understand SAW, TC-SAW very well. We understand what's going on in this sort of more advanced world very well. And we obviously understand BAW well across range of frequencies. So we know exactly kind of how these things play out and the strengths and weaknesses, what they get from and what they don't across the production and so forth. We -- and it's important to understand, we're not standing still on what we can do with SAW just as others can do and then what our BAW can do. And keep in mind, we've got decades of BAW manufacturing experience and SAW manufacturing experience, and there is -- I think that's an important thing to remember that we're not standing still, that device performance on the lower end of the BAW frequency scale, those devices are getting smaller, more cost competitive and have great performance to be a fair trade off. And then again, on the SAW world, we continue to refine our technologies. And the reason I said products, if you remember early on I commented that it takes the filters, the switches, the Pas, all that working in the shielded package. So it’s not just filters but I think Mark’s answer was excellent. But the reason I said our products are doing well is, it's more than just a filter.  Thank you guys. It is almost end of time. Bob, Mark, and James, thank you for updating us at the Citi Conference.  Thank you very much for having us, and appreciate everyone listening. Than you, and have a great day. Stay safe.
