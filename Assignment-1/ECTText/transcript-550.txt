I am able to hear some Mike. Sorry, everybody, technical difficulties. No, Mike, that's a perfect segue. Thank you. I'll just take a couple of minutes here to go over some of the financial metrics that build on some of what Mike's been able to accomplish and what he's hoping to accomplish over the next couple of months. So, as we said in the release Mike Jennings and his 50-plus team in Central California, we're extremely pleased to announce that in each of his last six months, Next Green Wave for not only cash flow positive, but also achieve both positive adjusted EBITDA and positive net income. And even though our revenue in Q2 increased substantially to $3.1 million, I'm proud to say our Q3 revenue is well on its way to surpass our Q2 results, as we've already achieved $2.3 million in sales with the entire month of September still remaining. And with that in mind, our operating expenses totaled $1 million in Q1 2020, this decrease to $750,000 in Q2. In Q3, we expect this number to drop further and below $700,000. This focus on increasing revenues while decreasing operating expenses will allow us to report a significantly increased EBITDA in Q3 2020. And it is the company's expectation to have an adjusted EBITDA of over $1 million in Q3 2020. So before I ask some of the common questions, investors have been asking to Mike. I just want to hammer home two things; Mike has brought up his update. So with our cultivation facility coming close to reaching capacity, we haven't receiving lots of inquiries regarding next steps in terms of financing types, expansion plans, the company is currently evaluating multiple opportunities, including developing its own land in Coalinga. However, we will not be making this decision lightly or quickly, and thus, we really have no significant update at this time. And hammering home another thing Mike said was in regards to revenue projections and new product sales goals, we're not ready to announce expectations regarding our new product sales or our overall 2021 expectations. But that being said, we have disclosed our Q4 2020 revenue projections in Tuesday's release. And we look forward to providing you details of these results of our new brand launches once they've commenced. So, Mike, I wouldn't mind just asking you two or three questions that have been filtering in here. You are about to come online with vape related products over the next 30 days to 45 days. Can you walk everybody through your thought process there with some of the negative press over the last 12 months related to vaping? Perfect. And then segueing into the other cultivation operations, what is your expectations for the nursery in Coalinga? And do you have a timeframe of when you might start to see expected revenue from this? Perfect. And the last question we have is, can you speak about your expectations for pre-rolls and maybe September or Q4? Perfect. Well that, there really isn't any questions filtering in here. So, Mike, if you have no further comments, I think we can actually end the call. Perfect. Well, thank you everybody for joining and we look forward to the next call in a couple of months.Thank you very much Matilda. Thank you everybody for joining the call. What I'm going to do is I'm just going to give everyone a quick overview of our current operations and strategic thinking over the next several quarters. And that will speak directly to a lot of the questions that people have about current operations, product offerings, expansion plans, et cetera. So that being said, as everyone has seen over our last couple quarter’s results, that with our current operations, the company is in a great position to continue to incrementally grow revenue and profit over the next several quarters by continuing to do what we're doing. And I've broken that down into four categories to give you our kind of a basic thinking on what that looks like. So first, continuing to optimize production at our current cultivation infrastructure; second, by expanding our current brand and product offerings; third, monetizing our nursery infrastructure through our project with GreenVenus, formerly Intrexon; and finally, by monetizing our extraction facility which we have been working on for quite some time. So I'm just going to go through kind of those four categories really quickly. So regarding our current cultivation facility, obviously we're already producing top of the market artisanal grade product. We're hitting our metrics as per the original model calling for two pounds per light of production – of flower production. But what we continue to do kind of on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly basis is through process and technology improvements continuing to increase revenue. I mean, increase production, quality and overall objective metrics by not only, like I said improvement of process and technology, but also through the continued search for more exotic and high-performing genetics called Pheno hunting. That's a continuing process that we're doing at our facility. And now that we've achieved kind of the model basis for operational efficiency and production, we're just continuing to grow that. Second, as I mentioned, developing and releasing consumer product goods in categories outside of the indoor premium flower category, such as pre-rolls, dabble extracts, vape cartridges, and edibles, those four downstream products from flower kind of comprise the bulk of the market. So we’ve already developed and produced our pre-roll line and just introduced into the market. We should be starting to see what sales are going to look like over the next quarter. And we’ll be able to start issuing some, guidance on what that’s going to look like market wise moving forward. Dabble extracts, we’ve already developed and hadn’t production. It only represents a small fraction of our current sales as we really haven’t pushed that to the market. We’re waiting for our other products to get in and be fully developed and ready to launch before we really go to market. But we believe that the dabble extracts segment could represent ultimately 10% to 15% of our overall revenue, once that’s at full force. Finally, the two products that I’ve been working on developing over the last several months that are ready for launch in September are vape cartridges and edibles. In those particular categories, in the vape category, I produced and developed a sauce based cartridge. We were – it’s all of the objective tests and lab test and field tests have come back extremely positive with the hardware solid, the packaging solid, the product is solid, so although, I won’t provide any specific guidance on numbers. We expect that to be a major category for us moving forward. Edibles over the last several months, I’ve developed a gummy product in the edible category. It’s a – that’s the gummy segment of the edible market is the largest segment of that particular category, which is why I focused on that initially to differentiate what I’ve done is 99% of the gummies available on the market or any edible for that matter are distilled based, which is a non-full spectrum distilled THC product. Well, what I’ve done is, I’ve based our gummy products on a full spectrum CO2 oil. So it’s not only vegan and gluten free, but the underlying cannabinoids, you get the full spectrum entourage effect in the same 100 milligrams. So it’s a huge differentiator. And again, all of our market tests, objective lab tests and field tests to come back positive. And although, I won’t go into specific numbers again, we anticipate that to be a major category for us in the edible segment. So third, as I discussed would be is monetizing our nursery infrastructure that through our project we’ve been Venus. Now we’ve been working on this project for over a year. We’re working with the Botticelli tissue culture‐based clones. We recently completed our first garden trial comparing standard clones versus Botticelli tissue culture‐based clones, and we’ve achieved equivalent performance, meaning we’re ready to go to market. In preparation – in Q4, in preparation for that we’d expanded our labor force in the lab on site ending for Q4 launch, and right now, we’re still developing the capacity limits for our current lab, which we will be able to start giving guidance on as we get closer to the – to market date. Now, again, with that product, all of our demand surveys have shown strong sales potential to both retail outlets, commercial cultivators and white label brands. We have groups that are committing to long-term purchase agreements to secure clean quality genetics of particular cultivars. And that’s exactly with the underlying models about. So we anticipate this being a strong revenue driver in – starting in Q4 2020, we’ll see what that looks like. And then I anticipate strong growth in Q1 and Q2 of 2020, 2021, as we scale that capacity. Finally, monetizing our extraction facility, as some of you know, we’ve been working with the local utility supplier, Pacific Gas & Electric for over a year to upgrade our electric infrastructure in order to get our extraction facility online that has finally been achieved. We actually are – are actually connected to the grid. And we are in the final stages of approval from PG&E to move forward with getting our occupancy permit in the city. So as we’ve been saying, we anticipate launching that in Q4. And again, there’s the extract market in California is extremely dynamic. It’s evolved a lot over the last 18 months. And that being said, we’re going to take a close look at the market before we kind of dive in and commit to our long-term strategy. But in the short-term, we’ve seen extreme downturn in the size of the CO2 vape category in the market. So we are going to be focusing on CO2 extraction in the beginning. We’re more going to be focusing on the production of artisanal high-grade hash, hash rosin, dry sifts, and dry sift rosin. And potentially, as our vape cartridge volume grows, we will consider both the production of ethanol based crude and the distillation of crude and the distillate, which are all allowed under our type 6 licensing. So that kind of gives you an overview of kind of the four areas that we look to grow revenue and profit over the next several quarters. Obviously, that really lines up with our original business model. So this is nothing revolutionary. This is really just about staying focused on kind of our core values and principles and abilities and continuing to deliver on those. And you’re really seeing the positive effect of that strategy in our flower sales, which are the predominant driver of our current numbers. And as I’m able to integrate further products, as I mentioned, and further integrate abilities like nursery and attraction, you're going to continue to see that growth in both revenue and bottom line moving forward over the next several quarters. Now that being said a lot of people have questions about expansion, because yes we are at, capacity, as far as sales we're at a 100% sell-through with all of our flower[ph] products, so. And we have more demand, we have more demand than to double or triple our current production capacity. So yes, smartly considering a potential expansion is where we're at. Again, we've achieved kind of an operational stability and a foundational kind of watermark for revenue and EBITDA and that's our lower bottom watermark and we're going to continue to grow that moving forward. So we're not going to do – I mean, we are going to be very prudent about any potential expansion and it's going to fit directly in-line again with our core principles and values and capabilities, and so that we can maintain that laser focused. And that's really we're – we're not planning, our plan is again is to maintain our current operational capacity and grow that within our current infrastructure and the accretion of some of these consumer product goods, where I've been able to create supply chains and infrastructure that does not rely on our current infrastructure or label – labor, excuse me, has kind of it creates a potential pathway to kind of have a exponential growth and scale without having to grow our own internal infrastructure. Anyway, all of those things are moving forward and are on the table. And, speaking to expansion like I said, that really means all of those things equal that, we don't really, we're not in any position, we don't need to do anything rash, we're not going to. And only the perfect opportunity that aligns with everything else that we're doing will be in consideration. So that's my update. If there are any Matilda or and Matt, if Matt has any closing comments or Matilda any relevant questions have come up? Okay. So I – that's a pretty complete… No, we are. Absolutely. So what we've seen in the research has shown is that, that was – that outbreak, in predominantly the Midwest and East Coast was due to a use legalization of vitamin E acetate in black market production of vape cartridges. None of those cases ultimately were tied back to the California market or the California legal recreational market. And what we've seen now is a huge rebound in demand after that's filtered out over the last several months in the vape category itself. So just to finalize that point, so, a) we have seen absolutely no evidence of any issues relating to legal vape cartridges produced in California or in any legal market for that matter. So and that, and secondly, b) as we've seen a substantial rebound in the size of the vape market as a percentage of the total cannabis market in California over the last several months. So those two things show that both producers and the market are comfortable again with the category and especially in the legal vape category in California, where we are – we've seen now kind of return and surpass the old market levels as kind of, we've got to past that initial scare. Yes. So, as I said, we just, we just ramped up production because we had a successful objective cultivation trials completed. And so what we've did – what we've done, what we did in response to that trial was we scaled our labor in the lab planning for a Q4 launch into the market. Now we don't have exact production maxes, but I – our goal at this point is to produce and sell roughly 20,000 Botticelli based plantlets per month. That's – and again, this is, we're still working towards scaling the labor and finalizing the numbers on exact production levels, but that is the – that is the initial goal we've set based on our thinking at this point. Yes. Absolutely. So we've been working – we've been developing our pre-roll product for some time and now we've gotten it to market. What we've seen now at this point, we've seen strong demand because they are indoor flower premium high testing pre-rolls. So we've seen strong demand in the category, but I think, I believe that we need another several months to really understand what that category is going to mean for us from a bottom line perspective. As kind of, I said my original comments. I believe it's going to be extremely strong category for us. We are in the premium top of the market segment in that core category, just like flower, which is our ultimate bottom line goal for all of our branded products. So we're doing everything right and to our ethos, but as I said, we still need a couple of months to really see what that's going to look like from bottom line perspective. Okay. I just want to thank everyone very much for their support and continued interest in Next Green Wave and to know that our team is – has been, and will continue to be 100% committed to driving shareholder value. And we're here on the ground working day in and day out to continue to do that.Good afternoon again. I'd like, again, to welcome everybody to the Next Green Wave call. And I'd like to introduce Michael Jennings who will start off our call. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to, you should be able to see a chat box or a question and answer box on the bottom of your screen, please fill that in at any time and the guys will try to accommodate those questions as we go through the call. I have not seen anybody type any questions at the moment.
