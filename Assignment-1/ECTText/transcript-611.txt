Thanks, Mohit.My name is Mohit Bansal. I'm one of the biotech analysts here at Citi. And I'm very happy to have Regeneron team today, Regeneron management team today. So, we have Neil Stahl with us. He is the EVP of R&D. He has been associated with this Company for a very long time; and Justin Holko, VP, IR. Thank you, Neil and Justin for joining us today.Thanks much. It's pleasure to be here. Great. Thanks, Neil. So, maybe Neil, just to start with. Like I said, you have been with this Company for quite some time and you have seen the early setbacks at Regeneron and then the earlier success came after a lot of work. As Len always says that I mean, EYLEA success was after 25 years of work -- hard work. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the secret sauce of the Company. What is it, which makes Regeneron what it is today? And you have been either a leader or fast followers in many of these therapeutic areas. What is which drives Regeneron? What is the secret sauce of the Company? Right. Well, I joined Regeneron in 1991. And one of the satisfying things that since the Company started, our focus and our approach has really been the same since the beginning. And that's focusing both, on deep biology and biological understanding, coupled with development of cutting edge technology across all sectors of the organization, and we've always taken the long view, knowing that really important advances don't come overnight. To paraphrase to your point about EYLEA kicking off of success, statement that I always use at Regeneron, which is a paraphrase of a Nelson Mandela, which is that we strive to either succeed or learn and never fail. And, as you pointed out, we did a lot of learning over the first 20 years or so until we got to EYLEA. But, over that time, we did create the whole VelociSuite -- proprietary VelociSuite platforms that we really built over 25 years or so. And that encompasses all of the things that we do to both, understand biology in terms of our deep gene knockout capabilities, as well as, creating the best, we believe, in class fully human antibodies using our VI mouse. And that continues with our rapid ability to develop cell lines for those antibodies and get them into manufacturing platforms. And this innovative culture really attracts a lot of talents. So, we're attracting a lot of great young talent to take over when us old fogies are getting gray. And of course, we still have Len and George as well as me and others who have been there for a very long time. So, we continue to maintain that culture for as long as we can. Great. Thanks for this. Maybe, so one question for both, I think Justin and Neil both of you, if you can help there. So, when you look at the R&D pipeline of the Company, there are multiple opportunities there. DUPI expansion is still on track. Libtayo is a unique opportunity and you have seen recent success in the lung cancer trial. And then, you have biospecifics, which is a platform in itself. Just trying to understand, where do you think investors understand the story already? And where do you think there is an opportunity and there is still a lot of potential, which is underappreciated it, and maybe investors could focus more on and where you think this is underappreciated? Right? Well, it's interesting that we do think that there are areas that are undervalued. And there are actually two that you mentioned. So, for DUPIXENT, we continue to see growth across atopic dermatitis across all age groups. And we just recently got approval for pediatrics for atopic dermatitis, and we're going to extend that into even younger patients because as you know, a lot of children develop really severe atopic dermatitis, I've known some in my life. In as asthma, DUPIXENT continues to outperform all the competitor launches. And we've seen good prescribing trends for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps among a different -- among a variety of different classes of prescribers, ENTs and allergists.  And along with growth in eosinophilic esophagitis EoE, and then, we announced this top-line achievement for COPD, where we exceeded a pre-specified level of exacerbations decrease that was administered by a safety monitoring committee. And so, we're blinded to that data. But, across all of this, we still think that there isn't an appreciation for the extent to which DUPIXENT is going to really penetrate all of these. And then, the other point about that is that DUPIXENT has been really successful across a whole variety of type 2 diseases across multiple syndromes. And so, a lot of times people have multiple problems. And so, it would appear as if DUPIXENT would be the drug of choice, not only for those with just AD, but those with AD and comorbid asthma, for example. So, we're really excited about the future of DUPIXENT and think that that's undervalued. Another one continues to be our whole immuno-oncology efforts. A strong data that we had for Libtayo in lung cancer and BCC really just shows that it's a equivalent to the best in class molecule. So, it's really satisfying to see how well that it performed in lung cancer. And it just gives us a lot of confidence that going forward as we use it as a foundational element of mixing it with or combining it with other types of drugs, both some that are in the clinic and some that are not yet in the clinic, that we don't have to worry about the activity of Libtayo. It’s proven itself. And then, as you mentioned, we have the co-stims that we're able to mix with it. So, we're very excited about seeing that data evolve over the next year. Got it. Just one interruption. Operator, it seems like people are complaining that they cannot see us. Can you please confirm if it is okay? I can see you, but I can't see it on -- I can't make it go anything but full screen. I see you and Justin. They're actually trying to sort the problem out right now, gentlemen. Okay. Do you want us to wait or we can continue? We have audio. Are investors able to hear us? We're checking on that right now. Okay. Let's just give it one minute. Let's see if we can get confirmation. Sorry about that. So maybe, maybe just some viewers, because I'm getting some messages saying that the webcast is viewable. Yeah. That's what I’m -- I mean, I think -- I have some clients complaining about this. So, that's why I just wanted to make sure. Yes. We think we had this technology squared away after all this time. I mean, I just had one more session, right, just now and it seems like it is still showing upcoming. I don't know why. Yes. I mean, on the website it shows, please stand by. Sorry about that. I don't know what is... Investors could join from the Regeneron website as well. That may be an alternative where some folks are having success. They're actually getting the correct link disseminated out to you guys. You should have it momentarily. Our apologies. Okay. [Technical Difficulty] Okay, great. So, very sorry about this disruption. In the interest of time, let's just get going with this. So, Neil you did talk about -- a little bit about the COPD trial and you did cross the threshold. I understand that you are not disclosing the threshold. But, we did see with other agents in asthma, which did not work for COPD. Could you please help us understand if the threshold is large enough where you can -- what you are seeing in Phase 2 would probably replicate in Phase 3 or even if -- is there a margin of error there, because we did not see those -- early phase successes with other agents replicating in Phase 3s with COPD? Right. So, all I can really say is that a lot of the other agents had seen maybe a 15% improvement in exacerbations at best, and we didn't think that was adequate at all. So, we set a much more stringent threshold, and we're told by the Safety Monitoring Committee that, we have achieved that threshold. And so, we haven't talked about what that is yet. But, it's enough that -- it gives comfort to go ahead and start another Phase 3 program, which is not inexpensive. And so, it gave us enough confidence to be able to move forward. Got it. This is very helpful. Maybe, I think investors would not like this, if I don't talk about the COVID part of the story as well. So, maybe if you can touch a little bit upon -- so you have a cocktail approach there and now you have funding from BARDA, manufacturing collaboration at Roche. So maybe starting with the biomarker data that you plan to release file by end of September. Could you talk a little bit about how many patients might be included in that biomarker data set? And, if you could help us understand what is the good data versus bad data, when we see the biomarker data there? Right. So, we should have data by the end of September covering several hundreds of patients that we can analyze and release, across our studies. As we said before, we are looking at viral load and replication and titers and other biomarker data. We have a lot of experience from our KEVZARA study and understanding what's going on in the bodies of COVID patients. And so, we'll be looking at an array of things. I'm not going to hypothesize as to what good versus bad looks like. At Regeneron, we really very stringently look at all the data from every angle and decide as a group together in the room, or in the virtual room, in this case, whether or not we think that it has merit, and whether there's a lot of consistency in the data. So, we'll be doing that for this valuation as well. Goit it. Maybe -- I mean, so do you -- the biomarker data would be stratified according to the patients’ baseline as well, baseline titers? Well, we'll do some exploratory analyses and see if there if there's anything that makes sense. Obviously, we did look at very different levels of baseline stratifier potentials for our KEVZARA studies. So, we'll look at those and use them as a hypothesis generating exercise to see for the rest of the studies, where we want to focus the analysis, if it's not across the broader population. Got it. That makes sense actually. Maybe moving to the manufacturing side of it, and I think, Justin, you would recall as well that there was -- there were quite a bit questions around how much capacity you have. And you did say that you have tens of thousands of capacity at that time for treatment and hundreds of thousand for vaccine approach. Now that the recent Roche collaboration, what it does to your capacity? And do you think it is enough to meet demand or do you -- should we expect more manufacturing [ph] going forward?  It's a great question. And obviously, BARDA is ethically supporting us to use all of our existing American manufacturing capacity for the COVID antibodies. And so, we're actually actively moving some of our products that are manufactured here in Rensselaer at our manufacturing facility, we're moving them to Ireland, so that we can have even more capacity here. And then, what the Roche deal does is it allows us to expand by about three and a half fold the amount that we can make, and we will be focusing on supplying the U.S. and Roche will be focusing on supplying the ex-U.S. And depending on how robust the data is, if there's a lot of demand, then we will look for other ways to try to increase the supply through other potential partners. Got it. One more question on the COVID side. So, last night, we learned about the AstraZeneca safety issue in one patient there. Just wanted to get your thoughts on, because the approach is similarly -- your approach is also similarly trying to target the spike protein there. And there are quite a few approaches, which are kind of similar in that regard. So, do you think it is related to spike protein or any other thoughts you have on that particular clinical hold there?  No, I don't I don't think it's related to spike protein per se. If you think about all of the vaccine trials going on in the world right now, when there's quite a few, and all of the other approaches like our approach with antibodies, and so far, this is the only event like this that's been reported. And so, we don't know if it's from their particular vaccine approach or whether it's just a random event that occurred that has nothing to do with the vaccine, and we anxiously look forward to their follow-up evaluation. Got it. So, you don't think spike protein is the reason there and you just -- probably like we have treated thousands of patients already. Oh, yes, tens of -- tens of thousands. Got it. And so, maybe now moving on to DUPI again. So scientifically, we have talked a lot about the rationale for targeting both, IL-4 and IL-13 in atopic dermatitis. But, still we share a lot of questions around potential competition from IL-3, jack inhibitors and even [indiscernible] atopic dermatitis in asthma, you could probably see TSLP as well. So, mechanistically, if you think about those approaches versus IL-4 and IL-13, what do you think about the potential competition for DUPI going forward in both, atopic dermatitis and asthma? Yes. Obviously, we carefully evaluate all potential competitors and follow them avidly. I think that we found a sweet spot where we over decades of efforts found the key signaling pathway for the type 2 syndromes that really drives it from the top. And that's the IL-4 receptor responding to both IL-4 and IL-13. If you look at the IL-13s, they may have some activities, some of them do obviously, but it just doesn't appear to be as broad as it is for DUPIXENT. And in asthma, their FEV effects are not similarly as robust across the board. The IL-5s, yesterday, even Nucala came out and they didn't have very good data in a type 2 indication. So, IL-5 blockade. There is the JAKi small molecules. I don't know if everybody knows that Regeneron was one of the early people involved, and me and George and others, in actually studying the whole cytokine receptor signaling pathways. JAKs and stats, we published some seminal papers back in the nineties, even before IL-13 was actually discovered, interestingly enough. But the thing about JAKs is that they're just not as specific. They have a broader number of cytokine receptors, family members that they actually respond to. And so, it's not surprising that they have a larger panoply of effects than the specificity given by DUPIXENT. And I think that's what leads to them having black box warnings, and you have to do careful routine laboratory monitoring for the small molecule JAKis that we don't have with DUPIXENT. The safety on DUPIXENT has really been fantastic. We have a three-year safety data set now. There's no black box warning. There's no routine lab monitoring. It's been shown to reduce the risk of serious and severe infections, including skin infections, and we have an extensive pediatric program. And also, just the ability for it to be active across a lot of different Type 2 diseases means that patients who have multiple syndromes can have alleviation with DUPIXENT from many things that ail them and not just targeted at one of the possible problems that they have. So, we're comfortable right now and very happy that we have DUPIXENT. Got it. That makes sense actually. Maybe staying on the commercial side of the business for one more question. So, EYLEA is still growing and it has been an unprecedented success in the therapeutic world. And you did make somewhat -- thanks to further enhance profile and life cycle management with PDGF and ANG2. But it seems like EYLEA is still good enough to beat actually with any kind of community approach. At this point, do you -- like, do you have any plans, or do you think Regeneron as a company could invest further to come up with something that can prolong the lifecycle of this product or your eye business? And what are you trying to do because? Because Roche has a port delivery and bispecific cells there, and you are also one of the pioneers in bispecifics. Is there something you could try to do to elongate this franchise further? Right. I mean, as evidenced by our trials to combine EYLEA with ANG2 blockade or with PDGF receptor blockade, we continue to try to find ways to increase the high bar of efficacy of EYLEA alone. And even with very optimal antibodies, like the ANG antibody was a very good antibody, we were -- we discovered ANG2 in the first place. So, we’ve been studying and working on it for a very long time. And it didn't show a big enough effect in a very robust study to actually make it worthwhile to block both. There's actually no rationale to have a bispecific antibody with one arm binding VEGF and the other arm binding ANG2, because it prohibits you from doing individualized dosing. The only advantage is, maybe just having to inject one protein and maybe a regulatory advantage of only -- and not having to show the combination of -- the contribution of individual effects. But, we continue to look at all things that might enhance EYLEA. Obviously, we're doing high dose EYLEA to try to increase the duration or the response time interval that they you’d have more patients that can go for longer intervals. So, it's a good franchise for us. And obviously we do a lot to try to look at anything we can to extend it. Do you have any plans to think about the port delivery at all, or do you think... We haven't talked about -- we haven't talked about anything with the port delivery? No. Got it. Maybe moving to Libtayo. I mean, you had a nice in the -- in April with non-small cell lung cancer data, showing very competitive data to KEYTRUDA. However, the question is commercial. And you have some sort of development plus commercial strategy where you plan to make it a backbone of your future therapies. Could you talk a little bit about how -- what is your strategy to actually compete in the IO field since Libtayo as your -- as one big piece of the puzzle? Right. Well, obviously the PD-1, PDL-1 arena is -- it’s huge. It's 25 billion and growing. And we have shown, as you mentioned that Libtayo is very competitive. It's as good as anybody else is. And that lung cancer data was very satisfying to demonstrate that. And it actually gives us a lot of confidence moving forward in our efforts to use Libtayo as the foundational cornerstone in our IO efforts. And so, we can then confidently move forward and combine it with our bispecific antibodies or the co-stims that we're going to talk about, or anything else that we have in the lab. Obviously, we're very good at making antibodies. So, you can imagine that we have a large coffer of antibodies that to choose from that we could combine with Libtayo. I think, we believe that oncologists and other stakeholders want to have a choice in determining the appropriate pattern. And all of the effort in CFTC [ph] that we've had so far, I think will spill over into lung cancer. So, we have a competitive launch preparation underway and we're going to share more details on that coming up. Got it. One question you get always asked on IO is that what is the max in this field? And obviously, high does were tried, and then the other agents are there, the latest one is TIGIT. Where do you think the space needs to go to maybe improve up on the responses that we have seen so far with the CTLA-4 or PD-1s, because we have not been able to find the right dance partner? Right. Obviously, we've done a lot of work across the board for a lot of different checkpoint combination targets. We watch TIGIT closely obviously. So far, it doesn't look like there's been an impressive increase in activity when you block TIGIT at the same time. But, we talked about our strategy of compete, enhance and extend. So, we think that given the activity of Libtayo, we will be able to compete in the PD-1 alone market or PD-1 plus chemo. But unfortunately, even as good as the checkpoints are, there is a lot of patients that don't respond. And so, everybody is looking for a way to enhance the responsiveness of different types of tumors. And, one thing that we have is either combining it, as I mentioned with bispecifics, CD3 bispecifics or the co-stimulatory bispecifics, which may be able to enhance the activity of existing T-cells that are already in the patient's body that are going to be unleashed with PD-1 blockade. And now you add in a co-stimulatory molecule to make those T-cells even more active. And then, there's other tumors with limited response. And so, we have novel combinations, we're going to try to look at there. And so, we're really excited about the future of all of these bispecs and there's even more in the labs that are coming down the line. And we also have the PiG antibodies, the Peptide in Groove. So, we can make antibodies against the peptide in the groove of an MHC molecule, and that allows us to sample the inside of the cell. So, in addition to being able to have the antibodies to look at the outside of the cell, we can also potentially target mutant proteins that arise from inside the cell. So, that's where we're going to go in the future. Got it, very helpful. And I'll probe further on that. But before that there is investor question on IL-33. It seems like investors have ignored off the recent data that you tried to combine with. So, doctors have been more bullish, in this question. Do you have any thoughts what are the next steps and gating factor for IL33 here? Can you say that again? So, IL-33, it seems like investors are ignoring the IL-33 after the recent data. But, doctors have been a little bit more bullish than investors here, according to this question. Can you, can you talk a little bit about the next steps and what are your thoughts on IL-33 and gating factors there? Yes. I don't think we've really given much guidance about our future efforts in IL-33 at this point. Yes. We're taking a look at some options perhaps in COPD and [Technical Difficulty] settings. So, more to come there, but quite early. We have seen it play out as well in diseases like atopic dermatitis and there was a little bit of a signal of asthma. So, probably more to come on that. But I think just to go back to what Neil said earlier, just shows what a remarkable drug the DUPIXENT is with regard -- what's able to really attack multiple diseases as it pertains to the type 2 diseases. Got it. So, that makes sense. Maybe a little bit -- a question, big broader question on the prioritization. I mean, you have a lot of early success for -- you have eight bispecifics in pipeline, two of them are co-stims and then you have PiGs as well. So, in terms of privatization, is there a certain pack in BARDSA, like this is the one you are going after first versus second versus other, things that are useful, probably there farther down the line? Yes. I think it's a combination of two things. One is obviously how mature our preclinical data is for each of them. But Regeneron is a very data-driven place. We're driven by science. And so, we make all the decisions on what to advance and which to prioritize based on science. And so, we have really robust animal models where we can make essentially a human type of immune system in a mouse and study maybe better than other people can all of these immune modulators in mouse models. And so, we use that as a -- obviously, as an important factor. And the beauty about our bispecifics platform is that we have a targeting arm and we have an effector arm, and we can mix and match them together. So, each one will go with any other one with our bispecific technology, which gives us a huge potential array of off the shelf molecules to use as we go forward. And these bispecs really have great in vivo properties that behave just like normal human antibodies. And we've never had any problem with them whatsoever. So, we're very bullish on being able to use that platform, not only with the CD3 effector arm, but now with the CD28 effector arms, and there's a lot of other effector arms that we're looking at in the labs as well. Got it. So, in terms of bispecifics effort, especially in cancers, it seems like there are quite a few players, Roche has one, there are other players out there. What do you think is going to be the point of differentiation, or is there a need -- is there a differentiation needed because these are -- these could address multiple indications eventually, but where do you think the differentiation would come and what do you think could make Regeneron, one of the leaders in this field? Right. We're very happy with the activity we've seen with our CD20 x CD3 bispecific, Regeneron 1979. And so far, it looks like it has very robust activity compared to a lot of other data that's been published with CD20 bispec. So, granted, these are not head-to-head studies, but to the best of our ability, we’re comforted by that data and we're excited about it. And we have other bispecs that are coming along like BCMA and CD3 as well. And so, I think it's going to be a rich data set to be able to look at. We've also made a lot of progress in looking at how to safely dose the CD20 x CD3. And so, to avoid cytokine release syndrome, we've come up with a dosing protocol where we start at a lower dose, and then dose escalate within a patient, once they clear the lower doses, because you see a lot of the cytokine releases is lower. So, I think, like most things, it’s going to be differentiated based on efficacy and safety. But, our molecules have really good biological properties in vivo. And we have the ability to, as I said, due to this mixing and matching. So, we have different strengths of CD3 arms that we can put on to any other targeting molecule arm. So, for some cases, you might want a strong CD3, in other cases, you might want a weaker CD3, depending on the targets. And so, we have that option as an easy off-the-shelf option as well. Could you walk us through like what you're going to learn about the bispecific platform later this year, early next year? I think you have quite a few data sets coming up in the next 12 to 18 months. Right. So, the thing that's coming up soon would be ASH in December, and we're going to be sharing updates through CD20 x CD3 and Phase 1 data in a variety of different lymphomas. We'll have the BCMA x CD3 that we'll be sharing an update of our person human results with dose escalation, and seeing if we can reproduce what we did with CD20 with inpatient dose escalation as well. So, I think those would be the next things that we talk about divulging. Got it. And then, one question, I mean, the age old debate of like bispecifics process of CAR-T, where do you stand on that? Do you think CAR-Ts eventually go before bispecific or do you think bispecific will always be an earlier line of treatment versus CAR-T? Yes. I don't think we have enough data yet to really say for sure. Obviously, we have partnerships with CAR-T companies as well. And we can actually use our antibody technology to help enhance their CARs to make new chimeric antigen receptors, or we can put T cell receptors that we can make in our mice as well into the CAR-T cells. So, we remain very interested in them. The thing about CAR-Ts is it's just difficult to control them. And I think the one advantage that bispecs have is that you can better control like these early bases of dosing. And you don't have to precondition patients; you don't have to customize a CAR-T for each individual patient. And so, the bispecs just seem like an immediate way to get a drug handed it into patients that could start helping them immediately. And so, we you think that with the ability to add a co-stimulatory molecule to the bispecs that they are hopefully going to be very competitive, but I still think there could be a place for both approaches. Got it. This is very helpful. And then, maybe one question we get a lot is that -- I don't know whether you agree with the sentiment, is that, Regeneron has a lot of late state development at DUPI and Libtayo as well. And then, you have a large an early stage pipeline, but the mid stage pipeline, the Phase 2 assets, there could be a little bit more to add there. One, do you agree with the sentiment? And two, do you plan to in-license or partner some assets in the future, so that you can actually fill that gap, if there is the gap, if you think? Right. Well, we don't look at our like that at all and we disagree with that sentiment. We think it’s rich at all the stages. The earlier pipeline is rich with bispecifics and the co-stimulatory molecules, as you mentioned. But, we also have a mid-stage thing. So, we have DUPIXENT in other indications, such as peanut allergy or cat allergies and things like that. And the beauty there is that we know it's a proven drug. And so, extending it to another important setting just seems like a higher probability of success than taking something -- an asset that doesn't have known efficacy. We have our anti-C5 antibody for PNH and other associated conditions. And we have the CD20 in Phase 2 and the BCMA by CD3 bispecific, which should be expanding out soon. And so, we do think there's a rich possibility. We've done some strategic partnerships around other technologies, such as with Alnylam and bluebird, and others that we think their outlook on science is similar to ours and that we work together very well with them. And so, we're very excited about advancing those as well. Got it. Well, that makes sense. Maybe one last question. I know we have time now. So, maybe we covered a lot actually in short period of time. How do you think about Regeneron as a company would look like in next five years? To this 20th annual biopharma conference, we both are sitting here, we all are sitting here and asking you same question…? Right. Yes. After being here 29 years, I don't think I've ever correctly predicted what we would look at five years in the future. But, I still think that you're going to see DUPIXENT, which is just -- I worked on DUPIXENT for 25 years before it was actually approved, and so, on the pathway and the targets and things like that. So, it's just very satisfying to see how broadly it's active in type 2 diseases. And we think that it's going to just be -- has an incredibly bright future that will continue to build out over the next five years. EYLEA remains the best-in-class. And with an aging population, macular degeneration is actually increasing, unfortunately over time. And we're very excited about our IO possibilities in the future with Libtayo as the foundational cornerstone. And then, we have all these new collaborations that we -- that I just mentioned a few minutes ago that are starting to bear fruit that's going to be heading towards the clinic. And so, we see a lot of strong growth drivers for the future. And I think, it's our goal to maintain the culture that we have that got us here in first place. So, as we grow, we're maintaining that culture. We're actually bringing along a next generation of young leaders, which are turning out to be great scientists and partners in what we do. And so, I think we're just all very excited about the future. Great. Thank you very much, Neil and Justin. I really appreciate it. I'm so sorry for the technical difficulties, but I think we covered a lot of questions in that short period of time. Thank you very much. Thank you. Mohit. Thanks, everyone, for dialing in. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. Thank you. Bye.
