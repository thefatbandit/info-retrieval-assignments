<p class="p p1"><strong>Bryan Keane</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Hello. I'm Bryan Keane, Senior Payments Processors and IT Service Analyst at Deutsche Bank. And we're super excited here to have John Rainey, CFO, EVP of Global Customer Operations at PayPal, to do a fireside chat today. It's going to be virtually, obviously now given the time. So, format of the call will be chat with John. I'll ask the questions. If you do have a question, you can submit it through the portal, or you can also just e-mail me and I should be able to get to it at the end.</p>
<p class="p p1">So with that, John, I know you're really busy. We only have about 350 questions. We've pared it down to 250. So, I know we only have 35 minutes, but thanks for joining us, and hopefully, you're staying safe there and same everybody.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>John Rainey</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Thanks for having me Bryan. And I hope you're doing the same as well as all of our audience.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Bryan Keane</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">So, John, I wanted to jump in, when I look at other e-com income players, they saw the slowdown in June and July. But for PayPal, the growth kind of accelerated in June and then was equally strong in July. And that kind of surprised us and some analysts. So, what do you think the difference is in the models that’s caused the acceleration versus the deceleration that some others saw?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Bryan, I think, we’re probably at a tipping point for e-commerce and for specifically our business. Some of what we've seen we think are fundamental shifts in consumer behavior. People just don’t want to handle money anymore. And what has probably gone from initially what would be described as pantry packing and stimulus checks, we think has become a much more profound and durable shift in consumer behavior. And one of the reasons we think that is because in areas where some of the shelter-in-place or social distancing measures have been relaxed, we're still seeing much more elevated levels of e-commerce activity.</p>
<p class="p p1">And for us, there's a couple data points that I think maybe justify sort of different trends versus everyone else. One is, we've seen, in terms of the new users on our platform, the single largest demographic in terms of growth has been what we're referring to as silver tech. There -- now my message, people age 50 and over that in many cases are coming to e-commerce or coming to PayPal for the first half and use cases like buying groceries online. And just last week, you're hearing the CEO of Kroger talk about how they believe that that's a fundamental shift in consumer behavior where people will continue to do that. And so, I think part of this is just our relevance has never been greater than what it has been now.</p>
<p class="p p1">And I think, second to that is the scale and perhaps corresponding network effects of [Technical Difficulty]. We are one of the largest players in digital payments, particularly when you look at our penetration among the merchant population. Today, we have 26 million merchants that provide PayPal as a form of payment on our platform. So, this just gives us a level of ubiquity that provides customers an option to pay with PayPal almost wherever they check out online. And so, I suspect some of those items perhaps may be influenced some of the trends relative to others in our industry.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">We saw recent data from Visa and MasterCard from August and it still showed really solid debit and card-not-present trends. And I guess, I was a little surprised because I thought it would maybe take a little bit of dip as there has been less stimulus. So, I'm just curious, have you been surprised by the strength of the consumer?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, first, I should start by saying, when we were in the March -- late March, early April timeframe, it was an unprecedented time and it was difficult to really predict what would happen. And certainly, relative to that period of time, I've been exceedingly pleased with the strength of the consumer. I think, part of it certainly is stimulus checks that have gone to people's bank accounts. And that's influenced perhaps some of the shift to owned money versus owed money. But, it’s been sustained at higher levels. And I don't know if that's maybe in part sort of behavioral shifts of people sort of in the period of time that we are maybe with macroeconomic uncertainty, maybe using their money differently, but it stayed at an elevated level. So, it’s been nice thing to see, because we certainly benefit from that on our transaction steps.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">You mentioned some of the customers in net new adds. I think, it was 10 million per quarter and I think was as high as 20 million in second quarter, including 3x a typical merchant adds. How sustainable is the accelerated adoption of that consumer and merchant side from what we're seeing?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, we've been exceedingly pleased. In fact, I would say, probably the single item that I'm most pleased about has been the growth in the net new assets. And we guided on our call that we expect to have 70 million net new assets this year. And again, it underscores the importance and relevance of our platform.</p>
<p class="p p2">And I think, we'd all agree that when people are lacking mobility and the ability to go purchase something in a physical setting, we're going to see heightened levels of e-commerce trends. And certainly, I think what follows is new customers. And so, I think it's -- maybe stretch to say that this is the new norm, 70 million customers per year. I think, we'd all agree that that's probably not a reasonable way to think about it. But, predicting how sustainable it is, somewhat tough decision. We're still only six to seven months into this. But, here's what we do know. We know that PayPal is more relevant than it's ever been before. We're providing more use cases than we have before. There are better experiences we're seeing on product offerings, things like Pay in 4. And one of the things that we're keenly focused on is as you think about sort of the composition of that number of net new assets. It includes activations, reactivations, and then it’s reduced our churn.</p>
<p class="p p2">And given our size and scale, we churn material number of customers each year. That's been where a lot our focus has been in these early months is driving consumer experiences to influence behaviors that will reduce churn. And I'd say, we've been quite successful with some of the early trends that we're seeing. And we talked about that on our last couple of calls where we're talking about the 10-day adoption rates being appreciably higher than what they've been for previous cohorts. And these are defined as a new customer coming to PayPal and using us four times within a 10-day period. We want to continue those kind of trends. And we believe with the movement to offline with the expansion of things like Pay in 4, and many of the other services that will be provided in the digital wallet, we've got a really good opportunity to influence that outcome.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">One of the big drivers has been the growth in PayPal Checkout experiences which remain elevated. I think it's up over 40% year-over-year in 2Q '20. What’s the historical growth rate of that and what’s driving such an increase in the PayPal branded?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, this is certainly higher than what the historical growth rate has been. The PayPal branded experiences have grown sort of commensurate with the rest of our business. Some of the faster growing parts of our business, like Venmo P2P and maybe Braintree, things like that have outpaced the PayPal branded experiences. But, we continue to see through the entire five years as an independent company, good growth there. But, to be very clear, this is an appreciable increase in what we've seen historically. And again, I think, it just shows our relevance, shows the convenience and ease of use of our experience and demonstrates the ubiquity app that we have with the side of the network with merchants, just being so of extensive.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">When you listen to some of eBay's comments, it sounds like they want to move away from PayPal Checkout. And obviously, the contracts now changed here. So, can you talk a little bit about that transition from the eBay on the impact it might have on volume, take rate and margins?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Sure. Well, first, let's start with what this transition that's happening with eBay right now is not a surprise to any of us. This is something that we've been planning for, for five years. And during that period of time, we've continued to expand other parts of our business at a much faster rate than what we've done with eBay. And just by comparison, Bryan, in 2014, when we were still a part of eBay, PayPal was doing roughly 1 billion transactions a year. Last year, we did over 12 billion transactions. And so, we've continued to grow these -- the part of our business that is not eBay at a much faster rate. And just to give you an example, on our compounded annual growth rate, the TPV growth over the last three or four years has been about flat through eBay. I think, it's up 1%, while our merchant services growth, on a compounded basis, has grown at roughly 30% over that same basis. I think, the exact number is 29%.</p>
<p class="p p3">And so, we've continued to prepare for this period that we're in right now. But that said, we think that the affect of this transition from an economic perspective is quite manageable. eBay has to have their merchants opt in to this new managed payments experience. And that doesn't happen at a stretch. I think, their own comments have suggested that this will -- this transition will take place all the way into 2022. And even then, we remain a branded payment option in that experience. And I think, the best examples are ones in the two entities where they transitioned first, which were Germany and the U.S. where we are at roughly 50% of the payment volume or appreciably more in one of the markets, in the case it’s Germany. So, we would expect to continue to retain that branded part of the business.</p>
<p class="p p3">And so, as you look forward, pick your one, two, three, four, five years, I don't expect that there's going to be any sort of appreciable difference in our economic profile versus what it is today. Certainly, eBay has a higher take rate than generally speaking the rest of our business. But, one of the benefits of the meter transition of this is, it allows us to scale to other growth companies and other marketplaces. And I think, we can look to the most recent couple of quarters and see the benefits of scale on our platform, where we had some record margins for our business by being able to grow and do it at a very low marginal cost. And so, the take rate is not something that we think is a way to manage our business or even quite frankly a health indicator of our business. We certainly look at the absolute margin dollars and the growth of those dollars as the best indicator for our success.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">One of the drags on the business has been the ticketing events was down 60%, I think in second quarter, which is probably a slight improvement from the trough there. Can you just talk about what the outlook is on that? Will that just kind of gradually improve probably still staying negative until we get a vaccine?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. This has been very clearly I think a part of our business that has suffered the most. And it’s as we said on the last call, it's roughly 10% of our overall volume. And, we saw sort of the peak level of decline right in the early periods of April in terms when everyone was locked down and shelter-in-place, everybody had stopped all travel. We've seen some resurgence since then. Things like Airbnb, which we include in that vertical. People are doing more regional drive where they may drive two or three hours and stay some place. And certainly, Uber is I think rebounded from the early period as well. Where we continue to see some pressure is really in the live events and ticketing. And you can probably get a good indication of that is watching the U.S. Open this last weekend or any of the football games and see the sparsity in the stands. And I expect that that's going to take a while to come back. These are long lead time type items, like if someone is going to host a concert and sell tickets for that, there's a certain amount of planning that goes into that; if someone is going to take a vacation overseas, that's not something that you whimsically plan in a couple of days and then fly out that weekend. It's a period of time where you have to plan for that.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">And so, this will be the part of business that I think will probably take the longest to recover. And if anyone's guess as to when that would be. I think, certainly it will be probably closely tied to a remedy for the pandemic that we're experiencing right now.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">John, when you look at the split on international to U.S., I know international was stronger in the past quarter, it grew 36% on 30% volume. So, just curious on that delta there, the stronger revenue growth versus volume. And then, on the U.S. it wasn't quite as strong. I assume some of that was a drag from OVAS, but is there anything else drag in the U.S. to grow the same way international has?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Sure. So, you're right. With international, we've seen good growth in our cross-border corridors, which tend to carry a higher margin. And so, we certainly have benefited from that. And in comparison, to others that have talked about their cross-border business, remember our cross-border business is entirely e-commerce. And so, we're not dependent upon a business we’re seeing traveling to Europe and then spending money while they're there. And so, we've seen continued elevated levels of cross-border strength across virtually all of our corridors.</p>
<p class="p p4">In the U.S., you're right. The disconnect between TPV and revenue growth was almost entirely related to other value added services, which has really two components that are worth calling out there. One is, lower credit income, as we had lower originations, customer relief actions, we even lapped the period last year where we received money for servicing the Synchrony portfolio. And that alone was over $50 million last year in second quarter. So, all those things contributed to pressure on other value added services revenue.</p>
<p class="p p4">The other item is lower interest income. As globally interest rates have come down and we carry an appreciable balance of merchants and consumer money on our balance sheet and with lower interest rates, we benefit less from that. I think, worth noting that Bryan, offsetting some of that was the inclusion of Honey in the quarter, which contributed over $60 million in revenue.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it. I wanted to turn to the margins. I know incremental margins were up 70%, transaction margins spiked, which is leading to the higher investment. You guys talked about the $300 million in the second half '20. Are these additional investments onetime in nature, or do you expect them to continue at this elevated level in fiscal year '21?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Well, the answer to that question, I think, is really one needs to understand and how we think about managing our business. And we believe that we can continue to invest for future growth, while still expanding margins in our business. And we've demonstrated that I think quite well over the last several years. Certainly, we recognize that this is a seminal moment in our history and perhaps e-commerce overall. And we need to invest into this, things like the expansion of QR code, Venmo acceleration, even expanding the digital wallet, things like buy now pay later. All of those things, we're investing heavily in, in the back half of the year. Because this is a, I think, an important moment in time, where there are some fundamental shifts, and we want to take advantage of those consumer shifts.</p>
<p class="p p4">Despite doing that $300 million of investment, which I should say will be a little more weighted to the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, despite that, we still expect to expand margins by over 100 basis points this year, if you look at through the guidance that we've provided. But, I think, the question is why now. Well, we've long talked about the ability to use digital payments or contactless payments, said more accurately, in an offline setting. And that's probably one of the single greatest areas of investment for us is that back half of the year. And this has been -- at least in the U.S., and arguably in maybe some of our core markets, this has been a technology that has really been a solution in search of a problem for many years. It's just quite frankly, has not been that difficult to carry around a debit or credit card and pay that way in store. And what we clearly see and hear feedback from our customers, both merchants and consumers alike, is that now this is a technology that is solving a problem.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">And you can either observe your own behavior or see it in stores, people just don't want to touch a point of sale device or keypad on a point of sale device. So, they don't want to handle cash. And we've benefited, in other ways from this system, like the growth of new users of Venmo or PayPal, they're doing P2P. And we can provide an option for customers and merchants where if you're a small or medium sized merchant and you just want to print a QR code and having our placard at your checkout register or even with your farmers market, you can have it on a lanyard around your neck and scan devices, you don't even have to open your phone, you simply click the picture button your home screen, and you scan that QR code at it takes you directly to the PayPal or Venmo app where you check out seamlessly in a click of a button. If you're a large enterprise, we're integrating with existing point of sale devices to where you can simply scan your phone right there at the register.</p>
<p class="p p5">So, for us, it doesn't require any type of significant software or no hardware investment. So, this is really the investment around. This is pretty much an engineering one, as well as go-to-market and marketing one. And we just think this is a very important point in time.</p>
<p class="p p5">So the question of sustainability of that that remains to be seen. I think, it's reasonable to expect that we’ll have elevated levels of investment for a period of time, maybe not at this 300 million run rate number. But again, we think that we can manage that while still growing margins and focusing on growth for the next several years.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">On take rate, transaction take rate was up significantly helped by branded. I think it was only a 2 basis-point decline. What does that look like going forward? I assume you still see strong branded growth, yet maybe ticketing and events comes back which might have a lower ticket lower take rate. How do you think about take rate -- transaction take rate going forward, John?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure. Well, we certainly benefited from a mix change in our business in the most recent couple of quarters. But, again, we don't view take rate as health indicator of our business. Even if you look at some of the acquisitions that we've acquired over the last couple of years, some of those carry a much lower rate, but in many cases, a higher margin. And that's really what we focus on as the overall margin profile.</p>
<p class="p p5">One of the things that we talked about earlier was the travel and events vertical. And some of those aspects of our business might have a different take rate to where -- when that comes back, that could influence it a little bit. But, I think fundamentally, what we've seen is just the strong growth in the PayPal branded experience. And we expect that to remain at more elevated levels than what we entered this time period in. So, that’s several items to consider when thinking about the profile of our take rate. But, if we fast forward a year, two years, whatever it is, I really don't expect anything appreciably different in the profile of our take rate than what we've been experiencing historically.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">One of the surprises in the quarter or the stat that surprised me was that for the first three weeks of July, Venmo, on the monetization side, was up 60% year-over-year. What was driving that outperformance in July for Venmo?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. So, this has been really, really great to see about a business and specifically the new used cases around Venmo. So, everyone understands that with the social engagement channel that Venmo offers, many of those experiences are in person. There are people splitting a tap at a restaurant or at a concert or a ballgame and exchanging money. And as those have declined during this period of time, we initially, in fact, saw declines in the Venmo volume. But, it's back growing north of 50% because of the new use cases that people have. Like I alluded to earlier, like we've got a new demographic or a faster growing demographic in the silver tech that is using us, in many cases for the first time. And people are spending money to loved ones or paying rents this way. And so, it's been quite exciting to see the relevance of Venmo during this period of time. And it's not something that as social experience has declined. We've seen a commensurate permanent drop-off in that related volume on Venmo. So, it's -- again, I think it really highlights the ongoing relevance and importance of this payment method to our customer base.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">I know you guys would be launching a credit card there. I assume you guys will be able to monetize that by capturing a little bit higher amount of interchange versus the Venmo debit card. Can you just talk about both those products, Venmo credit coming, the way you are going to monetize it on -- I assume it's going to be the interchange, and then how Venmo debit card has been doing?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Sure, Bryan. You are correct and that we will have better overall economics with the credit card than we do with the debit card. We will -- we share economics with Synchrony and Visa on that. We also get paid a bounty for new users. And as the overall -- as you mentioned, as the overall interchange rate is higher on credit than debit, it's better economics for us. And this for us is just another way for our customer base to be able to use us when and where they want to. And it complements many of the things that we're doing in the offline space around QR code, and quite excited about the launch of this product in the back half of this year.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">We saw recently the launch of Pay in 4. So, I guess, I'm curious about how you guys plan to monetize installments.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Sure. Well, it's something that I think we've all seen a general trend in payments towards this concept of buying now and paying later. And, for us, this is very much a way to capture additional share of checkout. This is something that helps drive additional sales for merchants. You tend to see the average order value be larger, and it creates more customer loyalty as well. And we can do all of that without taking on any additional risk or cost. And so, it's something that we certainly think that we'll gain a larger share of checkout going forward and benefit on the take rate from that transaction.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">I wanted to ask about the Paymentus integration. It sounds like it's 100% complete. But, there was still some volume that's supposed to pick up in third quarter '20. I'm just not sure I understood exactly what that. Was that from some of the larger billers ramping the extra volume increase you'll see in 3Q?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">That's correct. So, we are 100% complete with the migration for all of the merchants there, or the billers, I should say. And third quarter will be a little more representative of an annual run rate or quarterly run rate, if you will. And so, it was just really more the ramping there at the end of the second quarter, which influences the effect on volume.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Got it.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">I will say, if I can add Bryan that this is bill payments being sort of one of many things that we think really adds utility to our digital wallet. This is a sticky type of payment. It's not one that customers tend to vacillate from one month to the next, changing the funding instruments. It's certainly not to the extent of our other payment methods. But, as an example, much like subscriptions, where there is a stickiness to that. And we think that as we build out things like bill pay, things like subscriptions, even getting into sort of helping people manage their money, these are all things that increase the value and utility of that wallet and very much what we're focused on over the coming quarters in terms of some of our investment.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Got it. John, you talked about that there is now a real used case to get into the physical point of sale for obvious reasons due to the pandemic. In the past, PayPal hasn't been very successful. It's hard for me to kind of measure, to get a feel of how real the new strategy is and will this actually work, will it take off? Because if it does, it's -- it could take PayPal to a whole new level. How would you characterize the strategy this time? And do you think that we could see some real volumes here? Obviously, it will take some time. But, do you think you'll see some real volumes and some transfer of the online user move into PayPal to the physical point of sale?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, first, let me say that any skepticism around this is very fair. If it were easy to do, it would have been done successfully a long time ago. And, we certainly have a checkered history with our efforts in this. But, I think fundamentally, what is different right now is there's an appetite for this from both, consumers and merchants. And we believe that it is a time to invest. I think, Bryan, most would agree that contactless payments in store is a behavior or an event that certainly was going to happen at some period of time. And that's been demonstrated at scale in other regions of the world. I think, the question we all had was when will this actually take place? And we believe that we are in the throes of that right now. We are seeing the changes in consumer behavior. And with ubiquity of acceptance for merchants around this, I think, there is a real opportunity for this to stick and be successful.</p>
<p class="p p7">Now, all that said, success in this is not going to be measured in months or quarters. This is a multiyear effort to really be at scale, driving increased levels of engagement among our users, which, to be very clear, that's one of the primary factors of importance for us. It's not so much getting a PayPal customer or a Venmo customer to use us in an offline setting. The pure unit economics of that are less attractive than they are online. What's appealing though is that if someone is doing that in an off-line setting in store, then they're much more likely to use us when they go shop online. And we have an enormous opportunity to increase our share of checkout just to get people to use PayPal or Venmo when they can. And so, there's a dramatic halo effect to this that becomes very, very appealing from an economic perspective. But, this is an effort, which will take some time. We're going to invest appropriately into it. And we will continue to report out, provide some transparency around this to our investor base, so they understand the progress that we're making.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I think, we only have a minute or so left here. So, let me ask kind of the question I get often is, do you guys still plan to give a preliminary look on 2020 guidance on the 3Q earnings call, which I know you guys have done in the past?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">We think providing that information on the third quarter call, while it's still somewhat slightly premature because we're not completely finished with our annual planning process, we think that that's really important. And we also think sort of providing that transparency needs to be balanced with the reliability of that. And having spent almost two and a half decades in finance, with the exception of being in the airline business in the weeks following 9/11, I don't know that there's been a more difficult period or a more complex period to forecast. And we initially pulled guidance right after the pandemic for the full year. Then we -- this last quarter, we gave guidance for the back half of the year, which was effectively two quarters of guidance. And our desire would be able to provide that same kind of head nod on the third quarter call of how we're thinking about 2021. But, I think very importantly as we -- that needs to be credible and reliable. And so, we will work to do our best to provide that information.</p>
<p class="p p7">I think, irrespective of the guidance and the timing of that, we fundamentally believe that we are in a better place and we'll continue to be in a better place than where we were when we entered this global pandemic. There is -- I think, it's hard to question that there's been a fundamental shift in e-commerce, and it's been pulled forward by whatever the estimate is, two years, three years, even five years. And we're benefiting from that. We're investing into that. And we're hoping to influence the outcome because we believe that we're operating from a position of strength.</p>

<p class="p p8">And the follow-up to that of course is then, do you plan to update that midterm guidance, or do you wait a little bit longer to see how the year unfolds?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">John Rainey</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">I think, probably the appropriate place to do that would probably be at our next Investor Day, which is in February. But, we'll get some thoughts to that if it warrants providing an update prior to that, just given all the things that we see in our business. And it's worth noting that we probably have more change going on in our business in the back half of this year than ever before. As I mentioned, we're investing significantly into a number of different areas. We have a number of initiatives rolling out during that period of time. And it's always good to assess the status of that, see where we are and its impact on that three-year -- three to five-year medium-term guidance. So, our preference would probably be the early part of next year.</p>

<p class="p p8">All right. John, with that, I'll keep it there. I know you're extremely busy. Thanks for taking the time to give us an update and your thoughts during the crazy pandemic here. But, stay safe. And we'll talk soon.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>John Rainey</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay. Thank you very much, Bryan. Bye.</p></div>
