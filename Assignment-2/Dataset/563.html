<p class="p p1"><strong>Mohit Bansal</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. Good afternoon, everyone. And I think it is still good morning in Amgen’s world. So, thank you, everyone for joining us today. My name is Mohit Bansal, I’m one of the biotech [Technical Difficulty] here at Citi. I am happy to have Amgen management team today with us. We have Murdo Gordon, EVP and Head of Global Commercial Operations at Amgen; Peter Griffith, the CFO of the Company; Arvind Sood, the Head IR of the Company. Thank you, Murdo, Peter and Arvind for joining us today.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Murdo Gordon</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thanks, Mohit. Great to be here.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Mohit Bansal</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great. And those who are listening to us today, if you have any questions, please feel free to email me or send your questions via the webcast and I’ll be happy to ask them for you anonymously.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, with that, Arvind, over to you, just wanted to give you an opportunity to give a brief overview of the Company for first couple of minutes.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Arvind Sood</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Thank you very much, Mohit. We really appreciate this opportunity. Thanks for inviting us to participate in your conference. And I am just going to highlight a few key topics. And then will turn it back to you for the Q&amp;A part. But before I do that, I wanted to also congratulate you and your company on the great news of historic significance really that Jane Fraser is going to succeed Michael Corbat as the Citi’s CEO, obviously, with Jane becoming the first female CEO of a large Wall Street bank. So, congratulations on that.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Mohit Bansal</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">We’re really excited about that as well.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Arvind Sood</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. No, that's wonderful. So, like I said, let me just see key up a few topics and then, I'll turn it back to you for Q&amp;A.</p>
<p class="p p1">One of the key issues that I get from investors often has been the impact of the pandemic and outlook for the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="p p1">As far as we're concerned, the impact of COVID has truly been varied across our portfolio. In Q2, we saw an interruption in physician patient interactions that led to delays in diagnosis and treatment, but as physicians and patients learned more about ways to reduce the risk of COVID infections, we have seen some recovery during the second half of Q2. I think, our results for the first half are a very good indicator of the fact that our business is resilient with 8% revenue growth in the first half, and that's driven by 14% volume growth. As for the second half of the year, we see a pattern where providers and payers are encouraging patients to seek medical care, as needed, through telemedicine or in-person visits. And also, our customers are much better prepared to handle resurgence of cases as compared to five months ago.</p>
<p class="p p1">We fully expect to return to revenue growth this year, growth from our newer products, including Otezla, combined with growth from biosimilars is outpacing declines in our more mature products. And if you look at our biosimilars business, we have generated about $675 million in sales through the first half and we are now annualizing at about $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="p p1">We have several important pipeline readouts, Mohit, in the second half of the year, including sotorasib, tezepelumab and omecamtiv. And the last topic I will note is that with our strong cash position, the ability to generate substantial cash flows, combined with our access to capital markets, this puts us in a very good position to be able to invest both internally and externally, while also returning capital back to our shareholders.</p>
<p class="p p1">So, with that, Mohit, I'm going to turn it back to you for your questions.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Mohit Bansal</strong></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Great. Thank you, Arvind, for this overview. And it does feel like I was just talking -- it does feel like yesterday that in early March, we were talking about -- we had this conversation with Murdo, with Peter, where we were in pre-pandemic or pandemic was about to hit us. And it was an uncertain world and it is still an uncertain world. So, maybe the first question has to be about that for you, Murdo. So, on commercial front, it was a challenging year so far, and you have been able to manage it quite well. But, could you talk a little bit more about how you navigated through these challenges? And what could be learnings from this, for you and Amgen going forward, which you could actually use positively for the future?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Murdo Gordon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. It's an excellent question. The challenges, obviously, in the acute phase, as you referred to, were just really, we were focused on two things, keeping our employees safe and being able to continue to supply our products for patients who need them. And there were many barriers in the way for that. There's a lot of patient to physician disruption. Fortunately, our manufacturing organization who are to be commended. They were running all trains on time, no interruption in supply, every patient, every time around the world. But we were challenged, particularly in our portfolio of self-administered products, so Prolia, XGEVA, some of our oncology products, where a patient has to physically be in a physician's office to receive their treatment. So, we did see very steep impact there end of Q1, beginning of Q2.</p>
<p class="p p2">What I'm pleased to report back is the recovery now on those products has sustained through till most current period. So, we're seeing the physicians are adjusting, as Arvind alluded to in his opening remarks, we're seeing patient behavior moderate, and they're going back now to physician offices and getting that treatment that they missed in that kind of March-April time frame. So, that's good news for the whole year.</p>
<p class="p p2">The other thing we're seeing, of course, is our customer interaction between our employees and the customer has changed dramatically. We're running right now, I would say, about 85% of the pre-COVID customer interaction volume, but the activity has got a very different mix. We're probably running 40% to 50% live, and these are global numbers. So, this is a blend of Asia, where we're generally quite frequently live, Europe where there's a mix and in the U.S. where we're less frequently live. So, face-to-face live, obviously taking all the necessary distancing precautions and mask-wearing. But with that, we’ve had to open up all the remote channels. Now, we trained 7,500 people very quickly, early in the pandemic, on a series of technologies that we were going to be using. We had already kind of adopted those in some markets, but we made sure that that was a global capability.</p>
<p class="p p2">So, where are we now kind of six, seven months in? I'll have to say, the learning is that our customers continue to value engagement with us, particularly our medical teams and our account management teams. Our employees are resourceful in finding solutions for customers in a virtual realm. They have rapidly adopted new technology, and we've adapted our scientific content to be communicated at congresses or one-on-one or group settings around the world in a very effective way. So, if you'd ask me at the beginning of the pandemic, we'd be as successful in doing all of that, I would have had reservations. But now, I'm feeling that that mix may be more durable, even in a post-COVID-19 world than just a solution to get us through that period. So, the good news is, business recovery, strong and sustained channels of customer engagement and communication, open and nearing pre-COVID levels of productivity and the scientific exchange and collaborations that we're having very, very good. Couple of areas still being challenged, conducting clinical trials, again, a little tricky still. We've got most of our trials back on track. Our late-stage stuff was not interrupted or earlier stuff, a little trickier to do, particularly for hospital-based type clinical trials.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">So, I'm really proud of what the Amgen team has done. And I definitely see a sustained change in the way we're going to interact with customers, given what we've seen through the COVID period.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">So, on that topic, just one -- just a follow-up to that would be, how do you see the commercial organization changing, because we would probably adapt some of the learning from this pandemic and probably there could be some cost-ins as well down the line, so how do you think about that?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Murdo Gordon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes. I mean, we're definitely looking at the builds that we have for the new products that are coming differently than we were before. So, potentially, reallocation versus straight up building year-on-year. We're also looking at efficiencies in those digital channels. So, we no longer are anchored to geographical location for some of those customer-facing interactions. So, we can centralize some of that work and do that much more efficiently. So, you're right, in a long-term view, there are going to be efficiencies in the commercial model that will help hopefully lower operating expense.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Great. I’m sure, Peter would be happy about that.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Murdo Gordon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Peter is happy about it. But, what I see, my colleague, Dave Reese in R&amp;D will invest.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Oh, great. That's true. So, Peter, a question for you. So, Amgen does have a history of meeting and raising guidance. And you have been doing well so far, despite the pandemic this year. But just still keeping the guidance -- giving guidance the same, I think COVID related uncertainty is the reason. But just wanted to understand the puts and takes for our meeting and/or beating the guidance as we progress through the year?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Peter Griffith</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, thank you for the question, Mohit. And to Murdo's point, in all seriousness on that, we are very-committed to continuing to invest in internal innovation. So, we're excited, anytime we're able to affect the efficiencies and productivity that are so strong in Amgen and be able to use that to allocate capital to internal innovation.</p>
<p class="p p3">So, back to guidance for 2020 and talking about that a bit. This probably takes us back a couple of months. But, there's certainly puts and takes across the portfolio, where we think about the bone business, for example, that had some challenges during the most difficult times of the pandemic. That's seen a nice a bit of a rebound. Other areas during the pandemic maybe benefited a bit. We talked about -- Mardo’s talked about in the last some of our biosimilars and so forth. I would say, as we look towards the balanced portfolio, the rest of the year, we're back to kind of working forward on that in a way that we're pleased with. We reconfirmed our guidance back off of the second quarter.</p>
<p class="p p3">The resurgence, I would say, more maybe the episodic activities around the COVID-19 infections in parts of the U.S. and other countries has created some uncertainty. So, we could see some fluctuations in our quarterly revenue and earnings. But, we'll see how that plays out. And certainly, Murdo talked about providers and payers are encouraging patients to stay in touch with the doctors, whether by telemedicine, certainly trying to get them into the in-person appointment. So, we think the customers are better able to handle the spikes coming up, if those should happen as compared to, say, five months ago or so.</p>
<p class="p p3">On the spend side, you'll notice, we did spend less money in the second quarter. But, we look at that as a deferral. We don't look at that as a cancellation. So, we've got launches coming up that are very important to the Company and we want to enable those. And any way we possibly can and very thoughtfully, we certainly have, as a company, a history of spending more in the second half of the year also. So, that's important to keep in mind as we get to the second half of the year.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">So that's some comments on how to think about our guidance. As you say, we reaffirmed $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion in revenue, and we upped our earnings per share, our guidance of $15.10 to $15.75. So, that's where we sit right now. And we're continuing to work hard. And as Murdo said, we want our people safe, and we want to be able to deliver the medicines to our patients. And so far, so good.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">We have a running joke that Amgen bags all the cost of [Technical Difficulty]. And just aside. I mean, another question for Murdo. I mean, this is helpful actually. So, with the COVID still lingering and we have seen the employment market shifting as well. Are you seeing any shift in the reimbursement mix? I know, you talked about this in first quarter call, but are you actually seeing something on the ground at this point?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Murdo Gordon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. I think, given other options that people who transition from employee benefit have -- we haven't yet seen a dramatic shift in our payer mix. I would anticipate, given that people can transition to a COBRA benefit to perhaps, a spousal or partner benefit, and even acquire their own insurance in the private market, many of those people are going through some transitional benefits. Some people are of age that they can enroll in Medicare. But, for those that are going to have a COBRA bridge that may expire after 12 months, I would anticipate we may see impact in 2021, kind of in that kind of late Q1, early Q2 time frame. That would be when I'd be looking to see if there are major shifts in patient benefit that could negatively impact the industry. The other thing I would just point out is that many of these patients, because of the benefit programs that we provide on co-pay assist and co-pay cards, we are seeing some increased utilization there, nothing dramatic yet, but that could grow over time, which obviously affects our net price in a negative way. We're happy to do it, though, given times like these, patients need that kind of support. So, we continue to provide those programs in a fairly generous way because we want people to continue to have their medicines. But that would be the one other thing that sometimes doesn't get talked about and that kind of unemployment issue is just increased utilization of co-pay as people are economically constrained.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it. That makes sense. One other question is -- which is TDAPA -- TDAPA expiry, CMS has recently provided some guidance on add-on for cashing [ph] metrics in the bundle -- ESRD bundle [Technical Difficulty]. So, when you think about Parsabiv, how are you thinking about this may have any impact on the sales trajectory from the drug?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Murdo Gordon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Sure. The Parsabiv launch story really has been a nice success story for Amgen. We've been able to penetrate the midsize and large dialysis providers very well with that product, and we've continued to appreciate what it does for patients in terms of the benefit. I think, as we look at the proposed rule, as it's a proposed rule right now, as we look at that language, we made some suggestions during the open comment period, along with other interested stakeholders in the end-stage renal disease world who are concerned about how these bundled payments and ceilings are calculated. So, we're hopeful that those comments will have some impact on the methodology with specifically looking at the timing range for data capture. We think that more recent data would be more reflective of recent utilization. We'll see how that goes in November. A couple of things could happen. One, depending on that bundle rate, 2021 demand could be affected. And two, 2020 leading into the anticipation of that, we may see some reduction in demand for Parsabiv. We've already seen a few smaller dialysis providers reduce their Parsabiv demand. So, that is a dynamic that we're watching closely. And obviously, we're awaiting that final rule.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Got it. And how much soon do you think -- I mean, so, in terms of negotiation, do you think -- it's a proposed guideline, but where would you put the possibility of this happening versus not happening at this point?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Murdo Gordon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, there's really a range, given the different comments. Right? There are a number of parameters to think. As I said, where we're most interested in is what will the time period be for the data collection on the utilization of calcimimetics, to see when that calculation will be determined. What timeframe they'll use to assess how much room in the bundle for that utilization will be there. So, that's the piece we're most interested in. But we -- it's hard to pin down what the opportunity for that will be, given some of the other comments that will come in on that rule.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Got it. This is very helpful. Maybe one question for Peter. So, I think, you are in a -- as a company, Amgen is in a really good position where you've had a lot of R&amp;D projects going on. And so, trying to understand, and given your cash flow situation right now, how do you prioritize the allocation of capital between R&amp;D, business development, return of capital, you have a dividend as well. How are you allocating it? And, how should we think about the BD plan at this point?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Peter Griffith</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Those are good questions, Mohit. Thank you very much. Let's just start with, we want to continue to be very predictable and very reliable for our investors when we think about capital allocation. So, we maintain our consistency. So, our principles are unchanged. They're uninterrupted. And our principles start with investing in internal innovation, first and foremost. And that's critical to where we've been and where we continue to go.</p>
<p class="p p5">Second, capital expenditures remain a high priority. By way of example, we've got a next-gen manufacturing facility in Rhode Island, and we expect to be licensed and operational in the first quarter of 2022, on track, on time. And by the way, that's being constructed at half the cost and half the time, and we expect it to be operated at about half the OpEx of a traditional plan, very friendly from an environmental standpoint too also. As part of that capital allocation, kind of that second level, we too anticipate investing in technology there.</p>
<p class="p p5">Third, we continue to allocate capital to our external business development opportunities. And maybe just pausing for a moment longer on this to answer the second part of your question. When it comes to business development, we're going to continue to look for opportunities where we're the best or one of the very best buyers. If I could use Otezla as an example, where we think we were probably the best buyer. And that integration has gone on time, on track and been very, very good for us. We call that we're patient. We're prudent, secondly, in BD in the sense that we're going to wait for opportunities that clear our hurdle rate and provide a return for our shareholders, not just the shareholders of the sellers, which of course in this market environment is something that takes some work to do.</p>
<p class="p p5">Third, we're going to continue to be what we call precise in the sense that we want to focus on our areas of discovery, research and expertise, oncology, cardiometabolic and inflammation. Lesser degree, we would certainly look in, in our three commercial areas, bone, nephrology, and neuro migraine.</p>
<p class="p p5">And then, fourth on business development, again, kind of the third tier of capital allocation. We want opportunities where we know integration can be done quickly or we say, promptly, and that we can realize the returns and the value of the transaction as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="p p5">We continue to see a lot of opportunities, as we always have for Amgen. We've got an incredibly strong financial position. So, we have plenty of firepower to get done what we think we need to get done. But again, we're going to be patient, prudent, precise and prompt.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">So, now that we've looked at our allocations of capital inside the company, then we will return to shareholders as we have for any number of years. We're about 10 years into our dividend. This year, we raised our dividend, grew it to $1.60 per share per quarter. And we continue to think the dividend is a very important way to return capital to shareholders.</p>
<p class="p p6">And then, finally, as we indicated on our first and second quarter call, we'll continue our share repurchase program. But again, at the lower end, we've indicated at the $3 billion to $5 billion range that we indicated in January. If for no other reason, we understand it's an uncertain time, we understand that there are political sensitivities around repurchases, and we want to be thoughtful about that. This is all built -- capital allocation in Amgen is a forethought; it's not an afterthought. And it's all built on a very efficient capital structure to optimize our WACC. And when we say that, what we mean is, we want to be able to have a structure that allows us to have an optimal WACC, not a minimized WACC and keep us -- we have a strong investment-grade rating and we intend on continuing that.</p>
<p class="p p6">So, maybe a little bit longer answer than you were looking for, but we covered both, capital allocation and our principles around business development, both of which are very, very important to us here at Amgen.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Got it. I mean, this is very helpful, Peter. One follow-up question, which I'm getting from investors right now is, are you finding any challenges in the current COVID environment when you're trying to do BD transactions right now, in terms of meeting the companies, doing all your due diligence at this point?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Peter Griffith</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">That's a great question. And having worked in the M&amp;A environment for almost four decades, I think about it. But, I'm just pleased to say, we have a business development group, which I'm sure many of you -- of our investors know led by Dave Piacquad, who's been doing business development in this industry for almost four decades. Enormous experience, we have an outstanding team in business development, both scientifically and from a business diligence standpoint. So, we're not finding any problems from COVID. I think, what we're finding is, valuations in the private, in the small-cap and the mid- cap continue to be challenging to where we can find, as I just said a few moments ago, returns for our shareholders, not just the sellers, shareholders. And as I say, Mohit, and I say this somewhat jokingly, but maybe not right now, it feels like we're waiting to go something that may never happen. I think, we thought back in March and April that we would see some of these valuations settle down a little bit. I got some information, not too long ago, and I think it's important to kind of think about it where the pre-money IPO valuations in biotech have doubled since 2015. And after that, the aftermarket performance has been up over 60%. So, that certainly probably adds a little more complexity than just kind of getting transactions diligence close thoughtfully in COVID. It's the valuation side again. So, we'll continue to parse through them very aggressively and see what we can find. But, we'll always stick to being patient and prudent, precise and prompt as we do it.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So, I understand your point in the small mid cap side. But, large cap -- it seems that large caps are better investment. So, do you think a merger of people make more site at this point, some kind of big transactions?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Peter Griffith</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">No. I think right now, with the election and other things coming up, that I don't think anybody is probably thinking about something large. I think, right now, we -- as Murdo said and as we like to say, look, what we're focused on right now, we look at everything in business development, we prosecute it, we make sure we're not missing anything. But, most importantly, the business is running well. We want to keep our people safe. We want to get the medicines delivered. We've got three pivotal readouts coming up that are important to us. We want to be fully prepared to launch those. So, that's what we're focused on. And we're very pleased with the opportunities we see in front of us coming out of the internal innovation side. We'll make our way through those and continue to see what else comes in. But right now, I think, probably with the political landscape, there probably is a -- I suspect there aren't a lot of people out there thinking about anything too large in any industry right now.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Right. That's fair. Maybe one question for Murdo. So with Otezla, you have talked about double-digit growth in coming years. And you have -- you are on track with that. So, just trying to understand again puts and takes there. And how much, when you gave this guidance, TYK2 from Bristol was always on the radar. So, much have you built that particular competition in your projections when we talk about the potential growth for this program.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Murdo Gordon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. So, the short answer is, we did include the advent of another oral into the psoriasis market. So that was incorporated when we gave that guidance of double-digit growth for the product. As Peter mentioned, we're really pleased though with how Otezla has come into the portfolio. The team that led that integration did a fantastic job. Our transition, services agreements with BMS have gone extremely well. We have been able to successfully integrate the products around the world into the Amgen portfolio. And we're pleased to welcome the legacy Celgene I&amp;I employees into Amgen. We've been able to retain a substantial portion of those employees, so that we have knowledge retention and people who have live the success of that product so far. We can continue to drive for that double-digit growth that we're expecting for the product.</p>
<p class="p p7">Also, we're pleased that the mild-to-moderate trial turned over positive. So, that's a very promising [Technical Difficulty] brand. We're also in the U.S., our largest market for Otezla, we've integrated Otezla into our inflammation team, and we've cross-trained our employees in that team on both, Enbrel and Otezla. On Enbrel, we pulled out of dermatology fairly substantially, given IP uncertainty and some other reallocation choices we were making within the portfolio. Having Otezla back in allows Enbrel to go back into dermatology in a substantial way.</p>
<p class="p p7">And the other thing we've done in anticipation of success in the mild-to-moderate indication and filing that we're waiting to hear on from the FDA, we have started primary care promotion on Otezla in the U.S. That's something Celgene wasn't able to do. They didn't have a primary care sales team. We do, and we were able to put Otezla into that team of employees. So, we've been able to promote now with the primary care physicians, who are treating more of the mild-to-moderate patient, but treating them primarily with topicals. And some of these patients have large surfaced area of their skin involved in their psoriasis. And so, topical is really not an ideal solution. So, a once daily product like Otezla is a great solution, and we anticipate that as a new source of growth.</p>
<p class="p p7">And then, the international realm, we've been able to secure reimbursement in some markets where Otezla was not reimbursed. It was approved, but not reimbursed, most recently in Australia. We're working on approval in China. So, expanding the number of markets that we commercialize Otezla in will also be an important source of that new growth.</p>
<p class="p p7">Lastly and more specifically on the TYK2 product that you mentioned, I think, the rheumatology and dermatology world is going to be looking very closely at the data when they're available, given that the mechanism of action, another oral, will the safety data be what they need to be for that risk-benefit equation in a psoriasis patient population. So, that's the unknown. We're going to be waiting closely and watching. We have a great position in the market, post-topical pre-biologic. We have great market access, over 85% of lives covered in the commercial realm. It's just been a really good add to our portfolio.</p>
<p class="p p7">And the last thing I'd say, just in inflammation more broadly with the addition of our AVSOLA Remicade biosimilar, in anticipation of our Humira biosimilar AMGEVITA in 2023. We've got a nice rheumatology, dermatology portfolio there. And then we can add on the respirology side, hopefully, tezepelumab, pending data readouts at the end of the year. So, Amgen is a pretty potent player in the inflammation world, and I think that will serve us well competitively.</p>

<p class="p p8">Got it. This is very helpful. And then, just throw Humira biosimilar also in this bucket of Enbrel with Otezla. What sort of synergies one should expect now because we now -- with these three major products, you could be a power house in both, dermatology as well as rheumatology space. So what sort of synergies do we expect there? And in the Humira, there would be a little bit of pricing challenge as well, given that there really much is a fair share. So, how do you see or envision this market growing or evolving in the next five to seven years?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Murdo Gordon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. It's important to think about that, particularly given the competitive that rheumatology market is today. I think, the analog I might go to would be what we've done most recently in oncology with our two oncology biosimilars, not completely analogous, but very close. One is buy-and-bill, one is going to be more Part D. But, what we've been able to do there is use the existing commercial and medical structure that supports our innovative products in oncology to also promote the biosimilar products. So, we didn't build a new team. We don't have an adjacent biosimilars business unit. We embedded those biosimilar products. Our biosimilar for Avastin, MVASI and our biosimilar for Herceptin KANJINTI in the existing oncology team. So, I didn't have to add a lot of resource.</p>
<p class="p p8">And then, the other thing we had going on there was the team that was defending against biosimilars on Neulasta and on Onpro, were the same team contracting our biosimilars with providers, payers and the academic oncology centers. So, the knowledge we gained in defense of our proprietary business was translated into the biosimilar world. And I think we're going to do something similar in the inflammation realm. So, the commercial synergy is really very, very high. The medical support required is already there.</p>
<p class="p p8">And then, when you think about co-pay program assistance, reimbursement assistance for the practitioners for the average dermatology practice or the average rheumatology practice, those Amgen programs are well understood. They don't need to learn new programs to -- from what Enbrel offers to be able to initiate a patient on our Humira biosimilar AMGEVITA. So, that's a very nice convenience as well. These practices are busy enough. They don't want a new complicated version. They want to work with what they already use every day, which is a lot of the patient support we provide on Enbrel.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Got it. This is very helpful actually. I want to spend some time on key pipeline products, which are reading out this year, from the commercial standpoint as well. So, starting with tezepelumab, we have some data coming up later this year. Where do you think it gets placed in the asthma market? It is just getting prepared [ph] as we speak. And do you think it gets the home administration enabled, and how important that is? And the last part is, it should benefit in both low and high eosinophil patients. So, how important that is to show in the Phase 2 trial as well?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Murdo Gordon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. So I think your first and your last question can maybe be addressed together, if you don't mind, Mohit. So right now, we're studying a broad cohort of patients. And if successful, we should be able to achieve a broad label for both the high and low eos. Now, what I would say is clearly, the unmet medical need is low eosinophilic patients because there's not much out there for those -- for those patients to reduce their exacerbations of their moderate to severe asthma. I do think, though, given the mechanism of action of tezepelumab, the way in which that immune cascade occurs, should allow us to show benefit, if we're able to reproduce what we saw in Phase 2, in both the high and low eos population of patients.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9">I think, the convenience of that is something that, if successful, will be useful for the average respirologist or allergist who treat a lot of these asthma patients because they don't need to worry about, hey, is this a low eos high eos patient? What product can I select? Do I think we'll get more uptake earlier in the lower eos patient? Probably, because that's where there's unmet need. But I don't think it will prevent us from also penetrating that high eos patient population, given the utility without having to do biomarker work and really understand what profile of that patient is in front of them.</p>
<p class="p p9">Also, when I think about the opportunity we have with tezepelumab, it's really another pillar within our inflammation strategy that allows us to be in dermatology, GI with our biosimilars, rheumatology with Enbrel, and to some extent, Otezla, and now respirology, which is really kind of a nice full suite. And also, as we think about then, back to the question you asked, Peter, we think about disease areas where we would be interested in, in business development, this is one of the biggest, obviously. And there's a lot of activity in the early pipeline stage of many companies here that we'd be interested in.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Got it. So, this is very helpful. Similar question on the KRAS inhibitor. I know investor focus is a lot on monotherapy. But in cancer, especially lung cancer, combination approach is also -- and more often than not, it's probably the way to go. As the leader of this commercial team, what do you suggest to your R&amp;D team that could make your life easier? Do you -- are you talking about -- do you think the future of this molecule is in combinations or do you -- what sort of uptake do you see at the monotherapy versus the combination therapy?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">Murdo Gordon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes. It's a great question. And I'm sure Dave Reese, our Head of R&amp;D, is listening carefully to my answer. I'm going to be very methodical in how I answer this. Now, here's the beauty of Amgen, and Dave's leadership of the R&amp;D organization, in particular. In Dave's strategy, it is clearly stated that they are in the business of discovering and developing products that are accessible to patients. So, he's got access embedded in his R&amp;D strategy, which makes it much more easy for me to engage with his organization to say, look, we have to be thinking about the addressable population, let's call it, 13% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, the way in which these patients are currently treated. And then, the access reimbursement we need to achieve for patients in the U.S. and around the world. And I love that Dave's got that because there's very little white space between him and I then when we talk about development strategy for products like KRAS G12C.</p>
<p class="p p9">The first thing that he and I are both focused on is speed. We've been very focused on making sure that we have a rigorous clinical development program, but that we adjudicate that with very rapid decision-making with an empowered team that can move quickly. I'm proud of what they've been able to do, despite COVID in keeping that program running. It's pretty impressive stuff. And we want to be first to market with this important advance.</p>
<p class="p p9">Then, it's obviously about breadth of addressing the possible metastatic diseases that have KRAS G12C as a driver mutation. Then, I think they've got a program that covers that with the different cohorts of Phase 1, and we'll see how they read out and how we will proceed into Phase 2.</p>
<p class="p p9">And then, the point that you mentioned is what rational combinations exist? Because I agree with you, combinatorial approach in oncology has clearly shown it's the way to go with multiple different malignancies. And I don't think it will be different here. We're happy that we've seen single-agent activity, and we're happy that we may have an accelerated path for a single agent activity. But, we won't stop there, and we'll continue to explore rational combinations. And Dave's talked about the things that we're doing already.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10">Last and before Arvind feels the need to plug, we will show Phase 1 updated data at ESMO. So, that will be an opportunity for people to see how we're doing. And as I said, we continue to execute a broad program as efficiently as quickly as possible because there are patients out there who are underserved by what's available to them today, and they need this.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Great. Arvind, do you want to add anything?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Arvind Sood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">No, that's fine. Mohit, I think Murdo covered it very well.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Great. Thank you. Maybe one question -- one more question on the commercial side and pipeline side as omecamtiv [indiscernible] we had an important data, milestone coming up. Again, what do you think -- what are your thoughts around the profile of this product at this point, assuming success in Phase 3 trial? And then, I mean, this market is also getting more competitive with different products out there. So, just want to get your thoughts on the profile of the product and how it competes in this market.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Murdo Gordon</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes. I'm personally excited about omecamtiv, given its mechanism and its differentiation from some of the other more recently approved products, to your point about the competition. For a long time, we had no new approvals in heart failure. And then, a few years back, we had Entresto, and more recently, we had the SGLT2. So, where we think we have a nice opportunity is just the direct mechanism of action here in improving myocardial contractility. And that -- that's different than what these other mechanisms are, one being metabolically driven, the other one being hemodynamically driven. So, that's a key difference to focus on. And so we also think, given the design of our clinical trial, where we allowed background use of Entresto, we may be able to show that on top of that standard of care therapy we were able to show a benefit. So that's how the trial is designed. So, there will be some background use of Entresto. Probably less SGLT2, just given the timing of the trial because that's more -- those data are more recent, but there'll be some. So, we should be able to describe the efficacy with those background treatments. But, we're also pleased that there's very low incidence of drug-drug interaction with omecamtiv mecarbil. So, it does afford combinatorial approaches in heart failure. And much like we were talking about in oncology, a heart failure patient, particularly in advanced heart failure patient is on a cocktail of medicines. They can be on diuretic or it can be on an ACE ARB Entresto and obviously, now potentially an SGLT2. So, that's another nice feature in the product that was designed into the clinical trial.</p>
<p class="p p10">And then, lastly, we've studied a more advanced patient population. So, this is a patient population that many of them are frequent flyers in and out of hospital because of complications of their heart failure. They are definitely more difficult to treat because they'll end up with other complications related to their heart failure with edema and low ejection fraction. So, we are interested to see where we might be positioned versus, say, a more moderate heart failure population that was studied with some of the other treatments that I have already mentioned.</p>
<p class="p p10">So, for us, we've got a really interesting, differentiated mechanism of action. We've followed the design of our clinical trial to show that we could show benefit maybe on top of background therapies. And of course, we studied a slightly more advanced heart failure population.</p>
<p class="p p10">Last thing I'll mention is, we've, over the last year, been building an institutionally focused cardiovascular account management team. So, we already have the infrastructure in place on the ground, ready to launch this product, should we be successful. And we continue to work with our partner, Cytokinetics, on having them contribute to that effort as well. So, this should be an exciting product, and we're hopeful and we wait patiently for the data.</p>

<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="question">Mohit Bansal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Great. I think, we are on time here. Maybe one last question, if I can squeeze in for Peter. So, you -- among your large scale peers, you are one of the few companies with lowest ex-U.S. revenue profile. You have done some Asian deals recently. Should we -- in long-term, do you expect to see expansion to more like 60-40 ex-U.S. split eventually or that would take much more time?</p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">Peter Griffith</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p11">Yes. I think -- Mohit, thanks for the question. Look, we see it as an opportunity. We see Asia is very important. International expansion, volume driven growth, a couple of the key themes we have, China and Japan, the world's second and third largest pharmaceutical markets, respectively. So, epidemiology trends, the only forecast is to continue. So access to the medicines in those companies continues to improve. So, we want to be around that involved in that. So, currently, at our revenues changing to a 60-40 split is not going to happen overnight. But, we see the mix continuing to shift to ex-U.S. We talked about the Asia Pacific region driving about 25% of our absolute top-line growth over the next 10 years. So, we're very excited about it. We appreciate the question. We're committed to it and look forward to prosecuting that plan and executing on it. Thank you.</p>
