<p class="p p1">Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to Q4 FY20 Earnings Conference Call of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded.</p>
<p class="p p1">I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Jason D'souza. Thank you, and over to you, sir.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Jason D'souza</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you moderator. Welcome to Glenmark's Q4 earnings call. Before I start the call, I would like to introduce the members at Glenmark. We have Glenn Saldanha, Chairman and Managing Director, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals; V. S. Mani, Executive Director and CFO, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals; and Robert Matsuk, President, North America.</p>
<p class="p p1">First, the review of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. For the fourth quarter, Glenmark's consolidated revenue was at INR27,674 million, recording an increase of INR796 million. For the year ended Glenmark's consolidated revenue was INR106,406.69 million recording an increase of 7.86%.</p>
<p class="p p1">Business update on account of the COVID situation. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown across India affected Glenmark's production facilities in the month of March and April. However, by the end of April, Glenmark's manufacturing units managed to stabilize production and logistics were also in place in order to ensure uninterrupted supply to all our markets. As of now, all of Glenmark's manufacturing facilities are operational and the supply of raw material has also improved significantly. Further, internal logistics within India was stabilized by end April and exposed to all markets resumed to a significant extent by the first week of May.</p>
<p class="p p1">Since the start of the outbreak, Glenmark's employees across operations around the world have worked round the clock to formulate and adopt best practices that adhere to the highest standards of safety. Glenmark's employees have also facilitated the uninterrupted supply of medicines to every market it services. The company has made significant efforts to reduce the volume on the community on account of COVID-19 across its operational countries and manufacturing locations. The details are available on the company's website. </p>
<p class="p p1">In a landmark development for COVID-19 patients in India, Glenmark announced the launch of anti drug antiviral drug, Favipiravir, brand name FabiFlu for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. Glenmark received manufacturing and marketing approval from India's regulator as part of the accelerated approval process, considering the emergency situation of the COVID-19 outbreak in India.</p>
<p class="p p1">The approvals restricted use entails responsible medication use where every patient must have signed an informed consent before treatment indication. Glenmark approvals from India’s regulators makes FabiFlu the first oral Favipiravir approved medication in India for the treatment of COVID-19. Glenmark would be conducting a post marketing study as recommended by the Indian regulator on Favipiravir on thousand patients of mild to moderate COVID-19 for further evaluation of safety and efficacy.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Further, Glenmark also recently announced a new randomized open label study to test the combined efficacy of two antiviral drugs, Favipiravir and c, as a potential COVID-19 treatment strategy. The two antiviral drugs have a different mechanism of action, and their combination may demonstrate improved treatment efficacy by effectively tackling high viral loads in patients during early stage of the disease.</p>
<p class="p p2">Early administration of a combination of antiviral medications acted by different mechanism is desirable for the treatment of COVID-19, since the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaks around the time of symptom onset. The new combination trial will be called FAITH. 158 hospitalized patients of moderate COVID-19 infections will be enrolled in the combination study and randomized in two groups; one group receiving Favipiravir and Umifenovir with standard supportive care and one group receiving Favipiravir along with standard supportive care.</p>

<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p5"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">[Operator Instructions] We take the first question from the line of Prakash Agarwal from Axis Capital.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Glenn, first question for you in terms of understanding the revenue that we have clogged in in India and Europe. Are there any COVID related one-offs stocking, or how could we think about fiscal '21 across your major revenue items U.S., India, Europe, et cetera?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Prakash, if I look at India, in Q4 itself right, because there was some patients talking we saw. We got some positive benefit coming on account and particularly in the last two, three weeks of the quarter. As far as Europe goes, I think because of the Italian situation, one of our competitors was not able to supply and we were able to get some good business out of that in the last month of the quarter. I mean the run rate for both India and Europe, obviously, we cannot sustain this run rate in this current year, given the COVID situation and Q1 being a challenging quarter on account of COVID.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Any guidance you're giving on overall top line…</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">We're not giving any guidance this year, Prakash.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And any color on US, I mean in terms of like you said India and Europe. U.S., since we had a softer base given the dermal pressure, rising pressure now. How does it look fiscal '21 in terms of launches and in terms of growing on that base?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So, the U.S. continues to be a challenging environment. But our view is we have some good launches coming up, so there could be some benefits we see out of the U.S.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And my second question on the cost front, so we have seen significant improvement on the cost side. So, are we like 50% done on the cost side or there is more to go in the fiscal '21?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">V. S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, Prakash. So, Mani here. So, as it is on the cost front on the other expenses, you can actually see that all the efforts we put over the last one, two years has really borne fruit. So going forward, we also look at reducing or keeping some of our cost under check, both on the manpower cost front, as well as on the R&amp;D front, okay. So both of this will subsequently also tie in, you know bring down the cost position.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So there is more room you are saying?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">V. S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, definitely, there is some more room.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">And my last question on Favipiravir, so congrats on that. Just trying to understand how has been the initial pick up since it's the only oral for mild to moderate, and what are the expectation in terms of patient penetration and has health ministry or ICMR approved the drug?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So, look, Favi is a good launch for the company. However, obviously, this is a drug which is approved under emergency authorization and as to be prescribed by the doctor. So, there are quite a lot of restrictions in terms of usage of the drug but it's a good launch. It'll help patients in these COVID times where there is hardly any therapy out there. We think it can really benefit patients and it'll help in the longer-term as far as the company goes.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And last one if I may squeeze in on, follow up on Favipiravir. The combination looks more promising, and what are the timelines for that?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So combination we have initiated the trials, I can't give a definitive time line but it will take two, three months from this.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">For the launch, or you completing the trial?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Completing the trial.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We will take next question from the line of Nitin Agarwal from IDFC Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Nitin Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Glenn, couple of things on the CapEx at 900 crores, it still stays reasonably high versus most of our industry peers who’s pretty much seemed to be consolidating more for the last two, three years now. I mean for us now how are you looking at this you know this whole CapEx spend situation going forward?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">V. S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So, Nitin. This is Mani here. So, I think it will come down even more here. So we expect it to be around 700 or little higher than that. So, I mean, as we are guided even the last time, because we had some expenses in Monroe, et cetera, et cetera that is why it was a little bit higher. But going forward, we will see it lower, okay, both on the regulatory whatever we do, the routine CapEx as well as any growth or on that all put together, it should all be well below, I mean much lower than INR800 million.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Nitin Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So, still where how would you split it roughly between tangibles and intangibles, the INR700 million to INR800 million going forward roughly?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">V. S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">It should be about max about INR200 million for the in-licensing or whatever we do, and the rest will all be towards actually largely growth CapEx and routine CapEx. So, we will definitely try to bring it down, yes.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Nitin Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So this INR500 million, INR600 million on the tangible CapEx, do you think that's going to stay at these levels, it's not going to come down below that?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">V. S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">It will come down little below that as well, yes. We’ll see how much we can push it. We'll definitely try to bring in below that.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Nitin Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Secondly, Glenn, I want on the Favi, I mean how do you look at export opportunity for -- how should one look at export part opportunity for this product?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Well, Nitin, there are opportunities. Favi is already approved for emergency authorization in a host of countries, right, Russia, China, Japan, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, so many countries. So, there is an export opportunity going forward. But our first goal is to try and make it available to Indian patients. So, Indian patients get the maximum benefit.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Nitin Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And in terms of capacity, is there a constraint to capacity that we have for the product assuming there is a pick-up of the drug as per the trials and all go through?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">No, we don't have any constraints, we have adequate capacities.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Nitin Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">And lastly on R&amp;D, I mean the breakup that you’ve provided us, I mean at [500] odd crores of generic spends. R&amp;D spends are little, are fairly muted versus what’s the size of the business, right? So are we in the risk of under investing in certain businesses over the last couple of years and it’s probably reflecting the way our U.S. has grown. I mean how should one look at that number, and in terms of how it’s been in the recent past and how it will be going forward?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">I think R&amp;D as a percent to sales will come down substantially on account of just reducing overall R&amp;D costs, even Ichnos spend Y-o-Y coming down this year compared to last year. Additionally, I think it's important to keep in mind that Ichnos will capital raise this year, so that will further take out that, improve our cash flows there. So, I think R&amp;D, there is substantial scope for improvement overall as a percentage of sales.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Nitin Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And in what timelines it will for the Ichnos fund raise?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So, we've initiated the process, we'll see when it gets done.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">[Operator Instructions] Next is from the line of Shyam Srinivasan from Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Shyam Srinivasan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">My first one is on the efficacy for Favipiravir as a COVID-19 treatment. There's lots of literature around the world, including from Japan. So, just want to understand how effective is this drug and has it completed our trials that we initiated, or we’re just in the process of completing the trials just for Favipiravir? I am not looking about the combination. So that’s my first question.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So, I think Favipiravir has several, keep in mind that COVID is only a four to six month event. So all trials, I mean, there are tons and tons of trials going on globally on Favipiravir. And over 5,000 patients have been treated with Favipiravir. So, there's a sufficient safety database there. As far as efficacy, there are several trials globally, which have shown the drug is actually working, namely in mild and moderate. I mean, there are studies coming out of multiple geographies, because it's been so -- it's only been four to six months, many of these trials are now beginning to report. As far as Glenmark goes, we have -- now we've completed the randomization and we are still -- some of the patients are still completing the trial. So we are hoping that the trial should complete shortly and then we will unlock the database and get the data. So, that's kind of where we stand.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Shyam Srinivasan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So Glenn, you will make the data public, right? What was the trial data at some point…</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Shyam Srinivasan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">My second question is on Ryaltris. I think the MD&amp;A talks about the next steps. But I think critical in that is the plant resolution. So, if you can update us on the plant resolution or [Favi]?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So we're still working on that, on resolving the open items for [Favi].</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Shyam Srinivasan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So any timelines, because we've seen a host of Indian plant getting cleared. Is there something that, does it require an inspection, just can it be done through virtual audit, if you can help us just understand some timing?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I can't comment on that. I can't give any more visibility other than to say that we are working on it and it should happen soon.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Shyam Srinivasan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And the last follow up on that is, so it will be contingent I think the Ryaltris approval for the U.S. is contingent on that clearance, right?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">We have an alternate site also under qualification, so hopefully that should further help.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Shyam Srinivasan</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">And the last question is on the Latin American business. You talked about Europe and India being not sustainable. But do you think the run rate that you're seeing in the Latin American business, is that something, or does it also have some one-offs for the fourth quarter?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So Latin America by enlarge had no one-offs in the fourth quarter. But keep in mind because of COVID, right, I think Q1 is going to be challenging for most geographies around the world, particularly countries in Latin America.</p>

<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Saion Mukherjee</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">My first question is on the cost related to the Monroe site. How much has already come in? Can you quantify the number below, above EBITDA and also on the depreciation, because of commissioning of the site?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So Saion, in this quarter, I mean it just got property commercialized only at the end of the quarter. So obviously, there’s not too much on that. On the depreciation, also it does not a very, very significant amount, okay. So I think you'll see the full impact of that in the next quarter.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Saion Mukherjee</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So can you just quantify the numbers that you see on expense and on depreciation?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">It's not much as of now. But going forward, you will definitely see at least INR10 million add to the expenses, which should be absorbed with the products we manufacture there.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Saion Mukherjee</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So, this is annualized number you are saying?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Exactly, on the OSD side, yes. </p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Saion Mukherjee</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So, basically it seems to be a mixed bag. So how do you lead on commercial liability at this stage, given that the secondary endpoint was not met and how to think about the results and any comments there?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Your question was on ISB830, right?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Saion, just repeat your question.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Saion Mukherjee</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So I was, my question is on ISB830, your comments on that, given the pace to be reverses which came out, it seems to be a mixed bag with the higher benchmark secondary endpoint, not met and you're looking for a higher dose there. So in this backdrop, how do you see this product and commercial liability and potential outlicensing deal there?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So I think from this study, right, we can just conclude that the drug worked right at the top dose. And we're waiting for the part two data and hopefully, the part two, we will need primary and secondary endpoints, so that should help the drug. But you're right, I mean, it is what it is at this point.</p>

<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Vishal Manchanda</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">On ISB830, whether the secondary endpoints were not met even for the highest dose or the secondary endpoint was not met for the composite effect of all the doses?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">No, for the highest does, the secondary endpoints, there was a numerical change in the secondary endpoints, even at the highest dose. However, it was not statistically significant.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Vishal Manchanda</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">And next one on your R&amp;D strength in FY21. Would there be an absolute reduction since there are no large phase two trials that are ongoing, the last year you had a couple of phase twos running?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes. So on an absolute number it will be lower there.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Vishal Manchanda</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">And some sense on how much lower maybe like 5%, 10% is it?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">I wouldn't like to throw a number, but definitely I mean current year also it is kind of lower than the last year and next year also it should be lower than the current year, yes.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Vishal Manchanda</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">And just on the debt, what part of your long-term debt is calling due in FY21?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So we have around 400 odd crores that is falling due in the next year, and we have tied up all this. So there is no issues on those.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Vishal Manchanda</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">But would this be refinanced is what you mean?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, I’m saying refinance, yes. But some of those could also be repaired based on how the thing goes along. So we definitely see some reduction in the debt, because of reduction in CapEx, reduction in expenses, reduction in R&amp;D, all this should go down to reduce our debt. And also some of the noncore assets that we were diverse at, so all this should go around to reduce it, wouldn't like to give a number but definitely it go down.</p>

<p class="p p9">Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Next question is from the line of Chirag Dagli from HDFC Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Chirag Dagli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">So beyond GBR 830, what are the key data readouts for the rest of FY21?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">So, we have a lot of data coming out on, Ichnos, right. We have 1342, which is clearly the most exciting asset in the portfolio, right, for multiple myeloma. We have some of the 1302 also. I mean, there is a host of data readouts and inflection points in FY21. And I think from hereon, you see every year multiple inflection points in terms of Ichnos and some of the data coming out.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Chirag Dagli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Do you think 830 sets you back in terms of capital raising at Ichnos?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Not at all. See, Ichnos is, main value proposition is it's oncology franchise bispecific, the technology, that's the main value proposition for Ichnos. And the focus for the company is more oncology than immunology going forward. We have number of assets in preclinical, which we believe is the next generation in oncology, in multiple myeloma and various other indications.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Chirag Dagli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">And can you split the capital work-in-progress, what are the key elements? You’ve been running a very high [CV] for the last two, three years. What are the key points here if you split it?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">So as you see, this year itself would just come down. So now its about 1.000 crores. So of it most of it, a large portion of that is basically Monroe. So right now we could only capitalize the OSD side. We still have the injectables and nebulizers, and a couple of other projects work-in-progress in India. So broadly, it's more of Monroe and a few small parts in India.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Chirag Dagli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">And this you see capitalizing in FY21, all of it?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Not all of it, at least a good portion. I mean, the injectables would get capitalized in. So, you would see corresponding like the current year, there will be reduction again in the next year, it will come down.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Chirag Dagli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">And again going back to an earlier question, CapEx for your size of business, we are seeing much larger companies cut CapEx. What is it that your are spending, going to spend the INR700 crores on?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">So as I said, already we have reduced in the current year. We expect to reduce it further in the coming year also. So as we said, we have guided to a number of little excess of INR700 crores. So of this about INR200 crores would be put in licensing, whatever we do as everybody does that also. So the balance would be towards routine CapEx, any growth CapEx that we would need. But the endeavor would always be to reduce it further as well.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Chirag Dagli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">So the INR500 crores that you will do on tangible assets does have not any large ticket item, it’s basically run of the mill time?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Most of them, yes. And as we progress further on, Monroe we require a few additions here and then and those also would come in, yes.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Chirag Dagli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">So how are we thinking about encashing on or getting the return of the Monroe pipeline, because there’s a large capital expenditure?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">So I think, I mean, Chirag, this year we've got Fulvestrant, which is commercialized. We've got close Chlorzoxazone commercialize, two products, one oral solid, one injectable. We anticipate a few more injectable approvals this year. We have couple of good nebulizer launches coming up early next year. So, I think overall the viability of the site and the quality of the launches, which come out of Monroe will continue to stay pretty exciting.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="question">Chirag Dagli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">And the last question if I can on working capital. What are your thoughts, we’ve seen from linkage. Is it sustainable, can we improve?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p9">We’ll keep it tight here, Chirag to, I mean, number of days will be as much as it is. So, the growth in business, obviously, there could be some little growth but broadly we'll try and keep it very tight.</p>

<p class="p p10">Glenn, when you say statistically significant improvement from the baseline for ISB 830, what was the [ESI] score achieved at week [60]? Was it and say more than 50 or less than 50, any color on that?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">So Alankar, we can’t give any more data. This is only part of the, we will put the full data out once we get the part two, so both part one and part two.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Alankar Garude</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">So that will be in first half of FY21 then?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Correct.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Alankar Garude</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">So on that, Glenn, is it now safer to assume that we'll look to do any outlicensing deal for ISB 830 only after the part two data comes out, till then basically there’s, the focus would be just on the fundraiser of Ichnos?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Not really. So, partnerships is a big priority for Ichnos. And in the current year, we will target to try and close at least one partnership deal in FY21.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Alankar Garude</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">And that would be 830 as well?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Not necessary, Alankar there are, we have multiple levers, right? I mean, we've publicly stated that on the pain side, we are looking at partnering up pain asset, so 17536 remains very exciting.. Immunology is another area where we will do partnerships, and even oncology. There's a possibility that we may partner or co-commercialize co-partnerships with some, on some oncology assets. So, there are multiple levers and Ichnos, which we will use in FY21.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Alankar Garude</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">And my second question, Glenn, is if you could elaborate on the on ground situation in the domestic business, broadly how has been the impact on prescriptions over the last three months, MR interactions, anything on that would be very helpful?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">I mean April and May were tough months in the domestic market for obvious reasons, right? Sales reps not being able to call on doctors. I think most lockdowns in many places. So, these are difficult months for the domestic market. I think June, we may see some recovery but I think overall, the quarter as a whole Q1 will be a tough quarter for the domestic market.</p>

<p class="p p10">My first question is on the U.S. business. Glenn, you mentioned that you have a good number of launches coming up. Is it fair to assume that most of these good launches would be from Monroe, basically the injectable launches that you indicated to the previous question?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">I think the bulk of it will be for Monroe but there will be some from India also.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Neha Manpuria</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">And how many launches are you expecting based on your submissions to the FDA? How many should we expect this year?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Typically, we would expect maybe about 10 odd lunches this year.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Neha Manpuria</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">And the second question is on the personnel, on the manpower costs, when you say you should see a reduction. Is this as a percentage of sales the number should decline, or that number also should see an absolute reduction?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Well, you'll see it as a decline in the percentage of sales.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Neha Manpuria</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">And do we want to quantify that number?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">No, I wouldn't, Neha. As you can see when in another expenses given \some decent work, we brought it down by a percentage or two. So similarly, we will try our best to bring it down but we don't like to state a number.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="question">Neha Manpuria</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">And my third question is on the net debt. Now that we'll have proceeds coming in from the pool and divestment and also the consumer business. Is it fair to assume that some net debt reduction would be seen in the first half itself?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes, Neha, you will see some reduction in debt in the first half. So basically, one is obviously some of these non-core asset divestments plus as we already stated, our R&amp;D will prune down or expenses will keep under control. We'll also take care of our CapEx as well. So, all this should contribute to some reduction in the net debt on constant currency.</p>

<p class="p p11"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>

So can you please elaborate what will be key factor, which would help you in going from current level? And if you can talk a bit about your non [oral] solid initiative, say injectables or nebulizers for the U.S market, how do you see pickup there? And how many products for such opportunities have been filed so far, or something on that front?</p>

<p class="p p11">So I think the key driver for the U.S. will be the new product approvals, going forward. The pricing environment seems to be stabilizing but the new product approvals are going to be the key driver. And for Glenmark, I think injectables, nebulizers, some of the other dosage forms, should start contributing in the current year, which will help the business.</p>

<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Damayanti Kerai</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">And my last question on the supply side, I think you mentioned like we have seen now since normalizing on all geography. So if you can talk more about supply from API perspective. I understand most of the players have spoken about China supply as being now normal. So, how do you see that front? And any perspective for bringing in more in-house capability to rely, to reduce the dependence on the Chinese supplies?</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">I think we have already done that over the last last one year. We had a lot of, some of the intermediates and some of the manufacturing, we already bought back to India and we continue to do that.</p>

<p class="p p12">Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Next question is from the line of Aditya Khemka from DSP Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Aditya Khemka</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Glenn, on the U.S. business. What part of your current revenue comes from derma portfolio?</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Aditya, now on the revenue side it has come down substantially. It's probably about, I don't know, 25%, 30%, I'm guessing.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Aditya Khemka</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">And what was the comparable number at the beginning of last year?</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">About 40%, 45%.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Aditya Khemka</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">And if you could speak about the price erosion on your mupirocin portfolio. I know it's better, I mean lesser than the derma portfolio, but how much lesser at minus 2%, minus 5% in the derma, or flat…</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Now, its pretty much stabilized at about 5%, 6%, I'm guessing.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Aditya Khemka</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">And on Monroe facility, Glenn, so the general notion is at the cost of manufacturing in U.S. is you know definitely higher than what we do in India. So, you spoke about injectables being launched from both locations, India and U.S., we have Monroe and the plants here…</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">No, we don't have injectables in India. We only have in the U.S.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Aditya Khemka</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">You only have it in the U.S. Okay. Got it. So, just about the other sort of block in Monroe and the other sort of blocks you have in India. What would be the different profitability from the full plants and the asset between the two locations?</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">V. S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">The cost will be a little higher, Aditya, in Monro compared to India. But then see the broader opportunity like in injectables and nebulizers as we go ahead and we have some good approvals there. So, as you would also know, strategically, its a big advantage to have a plant in the U.S. considering whatever it is. So, it's much helpful to have a plant there. And so we put one there. And purely we are not a OSD plant and looking at the profitability there, it’s also there along with that there is a line for that. You can use and make whatever we want.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Aditya Khemka</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">What I was trying to understand is in India generally you know the gross asset turn for a plant and the total solid let's say is 2 times, right. So, if it’s under INR100 crore worth plant, you can expect INR200 crores of revenue. If I were to look at a similar level for a plant in U.S., if the plant cost $100 million, what would be the asset around plant?</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="answer">V. S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Yes, in India also it take you two, three years. Three year or four years before you reach the twice that turnover. So, I believe that in the long run, we should be somewhere there, yes, leaving the cost aside in terms of turnover, you should be much better off as we go along. Can't put a number to that but definitely it will be much, much higher, yes.</p>

<p class="p p12">Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We take the next question from the line of Chirag Dagli from HDFC Mutual Funds. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p12"><strong><span class="question">Chirag Dagli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p12">Thank you for the follow up. In your opening remarks, you mentioned dermatology pricing at about 20% year on year. Is this for your portfolio or for the market?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">This is for the market.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Chirag Dagli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Okay, this is for the market. Okay. And has the Ranitidine sort of completely came in the base for Q1?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Yes, in Q4 it has come in the base.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Chirag Dagli</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">So from hereon, we should think about the business as growing on this base of INR105 million?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">So Chirag, I think in theory, yes. Unfortunately, because of COVID, obviously, there could be some ups and downs in terms of the base also. But I think on a full year basis, this is the base.</p>

<p class="p p13">Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Next question is from the line of Tarang Agrawal from Old Bridge Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Tarang Agrawal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">I have the following three questions. One, what proportion of your R&amp;D would be in implied costs?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Employee cost also as part of the R&amp;D, we’ll try and get back to you but it should be around 40% to 45%…</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Yes, it should be about 40% to 45%.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Tarang Agrawal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">In case of Favi, is Glenmark manufacturing the entire value chain, that is intermediary, API and the formulation…</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Yes, we are…</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Tarang Agrawal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">And exactly how difficult is it to manufacture this molecule in terms of chemistry?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">So it's an eight step process, I don't know all the details but we have all the capabilities in house.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Tarang Agrawal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">And the last question, what is your blended cost of debt including currency exposure?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">So roughly you can say it will be around 5% to 6%, depending on how the currency moves there. We have to take it over a two three year period, you can't take it like one-off like current year.</p>

<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Just wanted to understand for Ichnos, what is the total balance sheet size in terms of investment done so far? And what is the kind of fund raise we are planning for the year?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">So, over the year we've been investing as you can see like current year also at INR100 million. So last two three years we have invested some descent amount of money there.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">Glenn Saldanha</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">The capital raise, Prakash, we can't give any visibility at this point, the amount, the quantum.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">But any color on balance sheet side please?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Yes, broadly around last one two years, whatever are the number. So those could broadly be figuring out in.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">So we watch it something, which we will book in Q1, since that you will put a press release. And Ichnos is the second one. What are the other levers in terms of debt deduction going forward?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">I told you there are three more, one is reduction in CapEx, pruning down R&amp;D spends, reduction in MPC cost as a percentage to turnover, plus also the divestment of non-core. So, all this should go to reduce…</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">Yes, I mean my question more from the non-core side. I mean, are we seeing more</p>
<p class="p p13">such asset we can…</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">There is one more, which we can't, we're not seeing right now but should happen sometime during this year.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">But it's not API that we had planned earlier?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">No, that's off…</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Prakash Agarwal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">That's off those, yes?</p>

<p class="p p13">Yes, that's off.</p>

<p class="p p13">Thank you. We take the last question from the line of Neha Manpuria from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="question">Neha Manpuria</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">On the gross margins, obviously, the derma pricing pressures reflected in the gross margin erosion that we've seen year on year. But if I were to look at the fourth quarter level of 64.5%, 65%. Should we be able to maintain this level of gross margin next year, particularly since we have good lunches coming from Monroe. How should we look at the gross margin?</p>
<p class="p p13"><strong><span class="answer">V.S. Mani</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p13">We should see it very close to what it is. I mean fourth quarter may not be the most ideal one. And the year is a better indicator always. So, if you look at our overall, it'll be around 64.5%, 65%, somewhere close to that.</p>
