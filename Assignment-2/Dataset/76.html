<p class="p p1"><strong>David Risinger</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">So good afternoon everyone. Thank you so much for joining us for this session with Eli Lilly. It's very much my pleasure to welcome Josh Smiley, the company's CFO. So I just need to start with the standard disclaimer, so I need to read that quickly. Please note that this webcast is for Morgan Stanley's clients and appropriate Morgan Stanley employees only. It's not for members of the press. If you're a member the press, please disconnect and reach out separately. For important disclosures, please see www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. If you have any questions, reach out to your sales representative.</p>
<p class="p p1">So with us, we have Josh Smiley, as I mentioned. He's been with Lilly since 1995 and has held a number of different roles in the commercial, finance and operational excellence teams; and also Sara Smith from Investor Relations is joining us as well.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - David Risinger</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">And I figured we would just sort of jump right into it. So Josh, maybe we could just start out with your take on the prescription market recovery and whether Lilly is on track for the updated guidance it provided when it reported 2Q results.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Yes. Thanks, Dave, and thanks for the time. I appreciate the opportunity. I think at the end of the second quarter, we talked about we were seeing good pickup in health care utilization. We were seeing a trend of improvement in -- starting in the U.S., starting in late May going through June and July. We said that we'd expect by Q4 to see prescription trends get back to pre-pandemic levels is particularly in the new prescription segment. We're seeing that.</p>
<p class="p p1">I think what we've seen since July is in our therapeutic areas, we're seeing utilization trends back up 90-plus percent relative to February or the rolling averages before the lockdown started. And that trend continues, I think, even when we start to drill down into hotspots or segments around the country. I think even when we're seeing sort of a resurgence, I think physicians and patients have figured out ways to get to the doctors safely even if there's concern about the virus. So I think we're on track, at least for the trends around health care utilization. I think we're starting to see the new-to-brand prescriptions also sort of follow that utilization trend.</p>
<p class="p p1">So we feel pretty good about the volume opportunities we're seeing, I think, for our brands overall. From a competitive perspective, nothing changed during the pandemic, so it's really a matter of getting the overall patient volumes back up and we're seeing that happen.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">David Risinger</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Excellent. Great. And actually, before we turn to some of the detailed questions that I have, I'd actually love to get your perspective on the evolution of the ROI and R&amp;D. And I asked that because I was looking at your background here, and you were obviously in charge of finance and the R&amp;D organization many years ago.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">David Risinger</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">So you've seen the evolution of R&amp;D productivity and the financial assessment of R&amp;D productivity. So it'd be great to just hear from you any thoughts on that evolution and how you now measure it at Lilly and what you're striving for.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. I think, first, and as you said, Dave, I've had a long history. The products we're launching today or started to launch, things like Trulicity, I was part of the finance team when they were just project ideas, so it's very gratifying to be on the back end here. But things have changed a lot. I think what we're really proud of in our R&amp;D organization is the increase in speed of development that we've seen over the last few years. We moved from probably, in the middle of the last decade, being probably among the worst when we would just look at apples-to-apples comparison of development time lines and -- to one of the best. And that's, I think, the biggest change that we see is we now have the ability to look at a project entering Phase I and can see -- and it obviously depends on the therapeutic area and the development plan. But in general, we're seeing years that we've been able to take out of our historical development time lines.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">That's got tremendous benefits. Of course, you're getting better therapies to patients quicker. But from a financial perspective, the opportunity to launch 2 or 3 years earlier brings with it competitive benefits. It obviously brings with it sales on the back end. So I think our -- now when we're making assessments around early-stage investments, they look a lot more attractive than they did 5 or 6 years ago because we've got a time value of money and longer to sell the product in a better competitive position. So I think that's the thing that's probably most interesting to us.</p>
<p class="p p2">I think though, we've learned a lot also about how to assess and progress projects. And I think one of the things that we saw from prior portfolio iterations is if you don't have good Phase II data that can inform things like dose and patient population for Phase III, your chance of success in Phase III is pretty low. It becomes more like a crapshoot, 50% or less. Our success rates in Phase III over the last 3 to 4 years have improved considerably as well. So we've got -- we're moving faster and with more certainty or less risk on where we come out on the back end. So you put all of that together and I think our ROI on R&amp;D investment in these last few cycles looks really good.</p>
<p class="p p2">We use like EvaluatePharma, which takes your forecast, everybody else's and puts them together. And when we look at that, I think, and compared to other companies, we feel like we've got a very productive R&amp;D organization. So if you just look at amount of spend over any reasonable time period relative to the inherent value that's captured in the portfolio, we tend to look really good.</p>
<p class="p p2">And I think it's for those reasons, speed, better probabilities of success and of course, we tend to now focus -- we used to be, when I started doing R&amp;D, finance, we were in 10 -- 10 or 11 sort of areas that we focused on. We've really narrowed it down to the places where we have really good scientific expertise. We're in 5 therapeutic areas now. I think we know what the science is. We know what patients need. We know what physicians want. I think that helps us as well.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">David Risinger</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Excellent. That's very helpful. So maybe we could transition to the diabetes portfolio, which obviously has tremendous long-term growth potential. Could you just characterize the penetration of the classes with momentum that matter a lot to Lilly, including the GLP-1s and SGLT2s just to give us a sense for the runway that you see in the portfolio?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Sure. First in GLPs, the thing we've looked at is, as patients progress from orals to injectables, we look at that first injection as a meaningful marker. And right now, in new prescriptions or new-to-therapy starts, GLPs are getting about 50% of injections versus basal getting the other 50%. I think the data is very compelling that, that should be almost 100% GLPs first before you go on to basal. So I'd say just from that standpoint, there's a big opportunity.</p>
<p class="p p2">Of course, if you translate that into -- it's been growing. So if you look at total prescriptions, it's still only 1/3 of total prescriptions in that injection space. First injection space are GLPs versus basal. So you've got more than double the opportunity just from the patient sort of population that we focus on today for GLPs. So certainly, you can project out for many years significant double digit, 20% type of growth and feel good.</p>
<p class="p p2">We see the bigger opportunities coming so not just that population today, but can you keep patients on -- can you get the benefit of a GLP longer? We just got approval for higher doses of Trulicity. We think that will help. Can you start earlier in treatment? We think that with the next-generation GLPs, like tirzepatide coming, I think there's a compelling reason to think about getting patients onto a product like tirzepatide because of the weight loss benefit and the profound ability to reduce HbA1c. We think we can further expand that pie. So a long way of saying there's a lot of room to run in the GLP space.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">I think in the SGLT2s, if we look at sort of total prescriptions there, I think it's only about 15% of diabetes prescriptions are SGLT2s. And if you look at the data on cardiovascular benefits, heart failure, it's pretty compelling. So again, I think we would look for Jardiance and -- as the market leader, but SGLT2s overall to continue to grow at pretty significant rates. There -- again, there's -- you can make a case that, that number should be triple or more of where we see SGLT2 utilization today.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">David Risinger</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Very helpful. And with respect to 2021, so just pivoting here and the revenue prospects, I think you mentioned recently that over 90% of your formulary contracts were set as of this summer. So could you just frame for us your visibility for 2021 at this point and how we should think about volume and net pricing components?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, sure. For the U.S., there are three major commercial payers. They make their formulary decisions as we negotiate with them. We tend to defer to them in terms of their announcements. But we are pretty close to being sort of finalized for 2021 and we feel really good about the access that we'll add. So what we've said is we have -- if you look across our portfolio today, with the exception of Taltz, really, if you look at our diabetes portfolio, our migraine portfolio, we've got like 90-plus percent availability today. So we've got really good commercial and Part D availability. We feel like that's going to persist into 2021.</p>
<p class="p p3">And we'll have Taltz where we have not had as good access. We do have an announced major change or win at ESI, so Taltz will be the preferred IL-17 agent there. So that's incrementally good. I think when we put all of that together in -- across all of our segments, our expectation is probably, on an apples-to-apples basis, our net pricing will decline in the low single digits. So to maintain the access and in some cases, upgrade the access that we have today, in total, that's what we see.</p>
<p class="p p3">Then the second factor there is what does the segment mix look like? And I think there, we do anticipate we'll see a little bit more Medicaid utilization in 2021 than we see in 2020. That's a function of the economy in the U.S. So we think that will be a little bit of a headwind. We talked about that on the Q2 call. So that if we quantify it today, we're making estimates based on what the economy looks like and everything else. So we think that's probably an incremental $100 million to $200 million headwind in '21 or something like maybe 1 point.</p>
<p class="p p3">Then I think the wildcard, of course, is what happens with legislative changes or administrative changes to government programs. I think we always anticipate -- we build some buffer into our thinking and anticipate something is going to happen that has happened almost every year since I've been in this job. But right now, most of the things that we see as potential changes tend to be in that 1- or 2-point impact. So I think it's -- we haven't given specific guidance for 2021 yet, but I think it's in that low to mid-single-digit net declines across the portfolio or across segments is probably a fair place to be thinking about it now.</p>
<p class="p p3">And that feels very manageable to us because to your second part of your question, we see certainly double-digit volume opportunities in the U.S. We continue to grow the core brands and core franchise as well. And then we'll add on to that full year of Retevmo next year, early adjuvant for Verzenio, we'd expect an approval there. So I think we've got some good additional growth opportunities in 2021. So we're quite optimistic, I think, about the opportunity in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">David Risinger</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Excellent. And with respect to that formulary change that you had mentioned for Taltz, could you educate us a little bit about when that impacts your gross to net? Meaning, do you take reserves in the third quarter of 2020 because of the price adjustment assumption or -- and/or how is that spread out over time?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. So the change will be effective January 1, so that's when the new pricing for ESI will go into effect. And the way we do our accounting here is we do everything on a current basis. So when we ship product, we make an estimate on where that product is going to be and what the rebates will look like. So we wouldn't do -- I think, to your question, we wouldn't do any reserves beforehand. It really would be on January 1. We'll make a new estimate when we ship Taltz on what that ultimate end price will be.</p>
<p class="p p4">What you do see though is because we make the initial accounting entry when the product leaves our dock, we then get bill -- those -- that product is going to McKesson or Cardinal or ABC, then, of course, it goes downstream and so on. So we always are making after-the-fact adjustments when we get invoices in from ESI or California -- Medi-Cal or something. And that's what you see in our -- the lumpiness in our quarterly results are. We'll say we thought 8% of the Taltz that we shipped in January of 2021 was going to end up in ESI and it turns out it was 9%, so therefore, we have to make an adjustment there. So we don't do anything to try to smooth. Again, I think we follow what's correct accounting. And unfortunately, I think what that does sometimes is you see some lumpiness in our results, and we'll come back and say we've made a prior period adjustment.</p>
<p class="p p4">It's really just because we can only forecast where we think the product is going to go, and then we true it up on a quarterly basis as we get the invoices in. All of that being said, I think what you should expect for Taltz for that ESI book of business is we'll have a lower net price but -- volume that we believe more than compensates for that or we wouldn't have done the deal.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">David Risinger</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. Very good. That's helpful. So then actually speaking about lumpiness, obviously, the other income was much stronger than expected in the 2Q, which will present comparison issues. How would you just characterize that? I mean, obviously, market investors should be looking through that, but it is a swing factor that people can't model and predict very easily and have to have footnotes in their models on -- to remember the anomalies in the prior periods, et cetera. So how would you tell us to think about that? And are you thinking about any changes in future guidance or anything like that along those lines?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. I think, first, I would say that the change -- the accounting change was last year where equities that we hold -- public equities that we hold, we have the mark-to-market. It used to be that you would recognize the gain or loss when you sold or you hold them at book value and then recognize a gain or loss when you sold. Now we mark them to market every quarter. We try to be -- I think we try to have as few non-GAAP adjustments as possible, so we just went with that accounting change.</p>
<p class="p p4">What we saw this year, though, is it's, I guess, a good problem to have is the -- about $2 billion in equities we hold, which are mostly a function of venture capital investments that we make or equity stakes we take with biotech partners if we have a partnership with them, they appreciate it considerably and we recognized that in -- a little bit in Q1 and more in Q2. I think that is a little -- so we try to be transparent about that.</p>
<p class="p p4">Our guidance for the second half of the year just assumes we hold, not that we have continued gains or losses, which we could have, of course, either. So we try to call that out as much as possible. Yes, I think looking at this now, it probably makes sense. This could be something that we, in the future, we sort of exclude from our non-GAAP earnings so that you don't see those kind of moves. If we do that, of course, we'll be clear about that and we'll get back to an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">But I think that -- in 2019, I always said, it's not that big of a deal. I think we're seeing now pretty big swings. Again, the good thing is they've been very favorable for us and that's real. Ultimately, if we choose to sell those, it's real money, but I think it does create some distortions in the income statement.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">David Risinger</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes. Well, you'll have to remind Dave Ricks of some of those gains when you have your personal year-end review with him since you are a key part of several of those transactions that have yielded big gains. </p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">I'll call you to remind him. Thanks.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">David Risinger</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So with respect to tirzepatide, obviously, your management team has conveyed enthusiasm about tirzepatide. Maybe you could just summarize the latest set of comments and expectations for Phase III efficacy and side effects relative to Phase II.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure. And first, I would say, I think the confidence you hear is, I mean, we're as confident as we could be at this point. Of course, you have to -- as you mentioned, I've been doing R&amp;D from a finance perspective for a long time. You don't know until you see the data. But the reason for our confidence is our history in the GLP space is that we can -- the Phase II data tends to translate pretty well into Phase III and efficacy and on general safety, we feel like we know this pretty well.</p>
<p class="p p5">Of course, the thing that everybody is really thinking about is tolerability. And can you get to the higher doses of tirzepatide and you get that benefit without patients dropping out? I think our confidence there is that we have a relatively step-wise, slow titration schedule that we think will, ultimately, based on our modeling and Phase II experience, yield similar types of dropout rates or tolerability to what we see with Trulicity. So that's the basis of our confidence.</p>
<p class="p p5">What will -- that confidence will be proven or disproven in the beginning in the fourth quarter when we'll have the first Phase III readout. And then the Phase III trials will read out between the end of Q4 and into early next year with then the goal would be to present the full data there in medical meetings in the first half of next year. I think we're -- then, of course, the commercial or scientific opportunity or clinical opportunity is if we can replicate the Phase II data in terms of HbA1c reductions and weight loss, we think this is a really a unique and step change opportunity for treating diabetes and potentially NASH and certainly obesity.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">David Risinger</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Excellent, great. So then, you've had some positive news flow on your COVID therapeutics. Could you update us on the latest news? Obviously, maybe just summarize it quickly, but talk more importantly about how you're thinking about it from a financial vantage point. You're obviously putting a lot of money to work to try to help the world solve or address this challenge but it'd be great to hear some financial highlights as well.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure. Yes. First, just to summarize it, on Monday, we released data on -- by Olumiant or baricitinib that when combined with remdesivir, it showed a benefit versus remdesivir alone, 1 day faster out of the hospital and other secondary improvements in terms of progression of the disease. And otherwise, we think that's a meaningful result. This is one that's pretty straightforward. We'll work with regulatory agencies around the world on potential authorizations. But Olumiant is already approved. It's a small molecule. Hospitals can buy it today. Once it has some type of approval, we won't do anything special here. We'll leverage the commercial price that's already in the market.</p>
<p class="p p5">In the U.S., that translates into about $150 a day for 4 milligrams, which is what it was studied in the trial. And it's for patients who are already hospitalized. So I think the financial opportunity there is relatively modest. You can do the math, but it's probably in the tens to low hundreds of millions of dollars over some foreseeable period of time. But I think more importantly is if it's helping the sickest patients get better quicker, we feel really proud about that result and the ability to bring that hopefully to patients around the world.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">No issues with allocation or anything here. This is a small molecule. We can make plenty of it, so I don't think supply will be an issue here. And I don't think overall cost is going to be a big issue for health systems.</p>
<p class="p p6">But I think the more complex but more frankly, exciting is the antibody data that we released today. This is a Phase II study. And it's a relatively small data set. But I think, first, we're just super proud that this is the first clinical trial that's read out on antibody. We went from -- of course, the industry went from no, nothing going on here to multiple trials now looking at antibodies, and of course, vaccines.</p>
<p class="p p6">We think an antibody treatment here is going to be important, certainly as a bridge toward broad vaccine distribution and potentially, even when we have broad vaccine distribution. Not everybody is going to get it, how effective will be, all those kind of things. So we're really encouraged by the data that we saw today. There's still a ways to go here. We've got to work on continuing to generate data, work on potential paths towards some kind of approval, emergency use or whatever it may be.</p>
<p class="p p6">I think if that happens, though, we'll feel good financially about the investment. I mean I wouldn't say this should be a reason for anybody to make a new investment in Lilly or anything else. This isn't a long-term play for us. But yes, I think we've said that based on the clinical work and manufacturing work we're doing today, I mean, we certainly are going to invest hundreds of millions of dollars this year, probably upward of $300 million on the antibody efforts.</p>
<p class="p p6">So if we have success and this becomes at least a temporary product, I think we'll probably more than pay for that investment. But again, I think there's a long way to go here to understand how long there's a benefit from an antibody perspective, how broadly distributed it is. The big thing for any of us, whether it's Lilly or Regeneron or Bayer or anything else, I think, is going to be the supply. It takes multiple years to build a new monoclonal antibody facility. So I think we all are working on how do you create as much capacity as possible. Our focus for 2021 will be to try to drive through reconfiguring our own plants, partnering with others to try to have millions of doses available, again, under the anticipation that the data that we released today is -- continues to mature and looks good.</p>
<p class="p p6">And I think in that case, then you'll see a reasonable financial benefit there. But it's probably, as I say, I wouldn't say that it's anything that will change the fortunes of Lilly long term, but it's so exciting for the people that have worked on this. And if we can keep people out of the hospital with COVID, of course, that has just a huge benefit for the world and for the economy and everything else.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">David Risinger</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Excellent. That's great perspective. So I wanted to ask another R&amp;D question and then pivot to some final financial questions. So obviously, Lilly is a leader in the development of neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease candidates. Could you just remind us what the next readouts are, timing, et cetera?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, sure. We have two, we think, exciting opportunities in Phase II right now. So the first is donanemab, which is our amyloid antibody. It is -- the Phase II trial will read out at the beginning of next year, so early in 2021. We like the drug. We think it's among the best we've seen in terms of ability to clear plaque. If that plaque clearance in a mild to moderate setting has a clinical effect, we think this is the right drug to really test that in the trial's design. It's a placebo-controlled trial with good clinical end points.</p>
<p class="p p6">So of course, we've been in Alzheimer's for a long time and the trials are perpetually disappointing. But I think in this case, we're -- fingers crossed, that we're going to see something. And I think if we don't, and I think we've given -- we've tried this mechanism as much as possible. In the second half of the year, then we'll have a Phase II readout of our anti-tau antibody. Again, I think we like the drug. We like the design of the trial. We probably have even -- we had to see, right? I mean I think this will be -- we're just starting to see readouts on sort of the tau approach.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">So I think we're covering what we think are the 2 most likely drug opportunities for Alzheimer's and we'll know all of that in 2021. I think the donanemab, one that we'll give and how much we know about amyloid, what we know about solanezumab, what we know about aducanumab, I think that's a big readout for us. I think my sense is that it's -- most investors think that's a low probability of success. But I think it's a great test and, of course, as you know, Dave, we need drugs for Alzheimer's, and we like the clinical study that we're running here.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">David Risinger</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Excellent. And could you just remind the audience, the plaque clearing is more significant than aducanumab? Can you just describe that briefly?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes. Again, based on our assessment, it's based on our Phase I data and cross-trial comparisons and what we can do in a nonclinical setting. We think this is a deeper and faster clearing of the antibody. So again, I think to the extent that you believe aducanumab has a real effect, and I think most people think it probably does and maybe it's modest, I don't know, we think that this drug will probably show something more from a clinical perspective. Again, I think the big question though is, is that faster, deeper clearance? Is that meaningful at all? If it is, I think we think we've got a great drug, and we think we'll have Phase II data that's pretty robust.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">David Risinger</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Excellent. Great. And so then just to wrap up on the financials. How does Lilly think about its long-term revenue growth prospects and the mix of volume and price? And then if you could also just talk about the operating leverage and what your expectations are for reasonable assumptions for a long-term operating margin.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Joshua Smiley</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Sure. I think from a top line perspective, if we break into a couple of periods, if you think between now and 2025, we've said we expect top-tier growth across the industry. We haven't given a specific number. You'd be better at that in terms of how you look at all the different companies. But I think that, to be in that range, you've got to be up in the high single digits on a net basis. We've already alluded to the fact that we expect net pricing decline in the U.S., and that's built into our expectations.</p>
<p class="p p7">So I think to generate that kind of number over a 5-year period, we're expecting double-digit volume CAGR. I think you just have to be there given what we've talked about. We think that's very achievable. We have to execute. We're in very competitive classes. But you look at what we have in terms of runway on Trulicity, we've talked about GLP and the new indication for high-dose Verzenio with adjuvant coming next year. We just launched Retevmo, Taltz. I mean we're -- we've got a series of drugs that have already launched or that have new data on the way that we think give us plenty of runway to achieve those kind of numbers through 2025.</p>
<p class="p p7">I think the good piece in that as well then on operating leverage is that's mostly coming through either scale or adding new data or new indications on to existing brands. So every dollar of sales that come from those things should bring with them more operating leverage. So our expectation by 2025 is that we should have operating margin move from 31% this year, which is our target, to mid- to high 30s. Certainly, from an SG&amp;A perspective, it should trend towards the high 30s. The reason I think we have a little bit broader range is we want to make sure we're investing at the R&amp;D at the levels that will continue to drive growth post 2025.</p>
<p class="p p7">And if we do grow at top-tier levels for -- between now and 2025, we need to have an R&amp;D engine that has more output because we're just going to be a bigger company. So I think that's the piece where you should expect to see continued investment, even though we'll demand and expect a lot of productivity from the R&amp;D side.</p>

<p class="p p8">I think the second half of the decade, then, I think it would be, in many of those cases, continuing to grow those brands, but then you'll see the benefits from products like tirzepatide. Other products in the pipeline that we're excited about are mirikizumab, our IL-23 particularly in the IBD indications; lebrikizumab, our Dermira acquisition. We see an opportunity there in atopic dermatitis. And then the next product from our Loxo acquisition, our BTK inhibitor, we've been quite encouraged by the early data we're seeing there. So that continues to replicate. We'd see a big opportunity second half of the decade certainly for that drug.</p>
<p class="p p8">So I think there's no reason we shouldn't, in the '25 to '30 period, also be talking about high growth rates because we like the pipeline that we have. And again, I think that should bring with it margin as well. I think -- I don't think there's any reason we shouldn't be thinking about something like a 40% steady-state target for operating margin. I think if we get higher than that, we're probably worried about, are we not making enough investment in the next generation?</p>
