<p class="p p1"><strong>Jason Seidl</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good morning everybody. This is Jason Seidl from Cowen, your friendly neighborhood transport analyst. Welcome to our 13th Annual Global Transportation and Sustainable Mobility Conference.</p>
<p class="p p1">Kicking off today Cowen is honored and pleased to have CSX. With us from CSX, we have Mark Wallace, EVP of Sales and Marketing. And Mark good morning thank you for joining us from Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Mark Wallace</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Thank you, Jason. It's great to be with you. And unfortunately, we're doing this over Zoom. It'd be nice to see you in person, but it is what it is and we look forward to a great conversation this morning. Thanks for having us.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p1"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Jason Seidl</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Absolutely. So I'm going to just dive in with some questions right here. And then just for the audience you can go into the chat room and ask some questions. And if we have time at the end, I'll relay these questions to Mark. Okay. Mark so – </p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Jason, I am – I am joined by my colleague Bill Slater as well, who's our AVP of Investor Relations as well in the room here with me this morning.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes. Good morning to you too, Bill. You're slightly out of – as scene there a bit. But good morning. So Mark, so intermodal volumes have been in recovery mode of late. What's brought this about in your opinion?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yeah. No, intermodal has been a nice boost here. We've really seen a real uptick in our volumes. On the domestic side, we really started to see the sort of end of Q2, where our domestic volumes really started to rebound as we were sort of coming out of the shutdowns and people staying at home and people are coming back to work and the economy was sort of coming back to life a little bit. And we started to really see the replenishment of inventories happen around that sort of the end of Q2, beginning of July time frame. And that has carried on.</p>
<p class="p p1">The volumes have been very, very strong. Much to our delight stronger than I thought it would have been. But clearly, the consumer is back. The consumer is spending. Inventories were depleted. People are buying things. You've seen some of the retailers some of their numbers the Walmarts of the world. I mean, people are out there spending money. They're doing quite well.</p>
<p class="p p1">E-commerce is doing really well, as people were staying at home ordering things online. That segment of our business has been extremely strong over the last couple of months. And then about two months ago, Jason, we really started to see the volumes pick up on the international side, especially on the West Coast of the United States. As people were – the steamship lines were looking to get product into the United States as quickly as possible, they were bringing – they were visiting the – shipping to the West Coast, getting that product in land. A lot of that translated into some domestic volumes for us.</p>
<p class="p p1">And then just about recently about a month ago, we started to see the sailings come to the East Coast. And our international volumes on the East Coast ports has been incredibly strong over the last month or so. So we're really excited by that. I've spoken to a number of customers.</p>
<p class="p p1">On the international side, the steamship lines are quite pleased with the volumes that they're seeing coming in internationally. They expect that will continue through Q3 probably into November early December. After that, it gets a little murky. They're still sort of cautiously optimistic is the word I keep hearing from them. But certainly, we're encouraged on the international side and the volumes that we're seeing.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">Domestically, again, I've spoken to a number of customers. I spoke to one yesterday, one of our channel partners, who was incredibly bullish in the volumes that they're seeing. They think this will continue until at least until the end of the year. A lot of it is supply and demand. I mean, the demand is quite strong. People are buying, but the inventories are being replenished just as rapidly. So we're seeing strength across the intermodal business. Our volumes quarter-to-date are up 6% and we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Knocking on wood for you there. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Absolutely. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Talk a little bit about the relationship with truckload pricing and intermodal pricing. Truckload pricing you've obviously seen spot sort of off into the races almost at 2018 peak levels. When should we see intermodal pricing recover? And what type of lag is there typically that CSX has noticed over the years? </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. Certainly with the demand Jason, we've seen that truck prices go up. I think it's a function also there's a lot of demand out there, but it's also a supply issue I think in talking to a couple of our customers certainly there's some concern with respect to drivers. So there's a shortage there. People who were laid off may not be coming back and not wanting to drive anymore be a truck driver. So there's a bit of an issue there. And I think you're starting to see and obviously, we're seeing the truck prices go up quite significantly. </p>
<p class="p p2">How that translate into intermodal? As you know, most of the -- the vast majority of our contracts in intermodal are with our channel partners. Those are longer-term deals. So we don't benefit just because the spot rate goes up significantly within two or three months. It takes some time for us to be able to really see the impact of that. I would say sort of into next year and into bid season and when those contracts, when those pricing mechanisms come up for renewal, we'll start to see a little bit of a bump there. But clearly we're not -- we don't benefit in the short-term just based on the spot rate.</p>
<p class="p p2">I think there's a very small fraction of our business that is tied to sort of the spot trucking market. It's very, very small. I've talked about this before. It's really a non-material impact. So again, it really doesn't have a material impact on our overall intermodal business at least in the short-term. </p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Got you. That makes sense. Let's look at the intermodal business a little bit for the longer-term now. If you go back, I hosted a State of the Ports call. And on the call, we were fortunate enough to have the Executive Director of the Port of L.A. and he was talking about longer-term, the West Coast losing like 15% of its business to the East Coast ports as well as the Gulf ports. How do you view this sort of shift for CSX and some of the even the longer-term trucking issues that might be out there and gaining enough drivers over the long run?</p>
<p class="p p2">When you look at the driver pool, we don't really typically get enough younger people in. The population has aged a little bit at least heading into COVID at that. How do you view that business for you guys over the long run, or what should we look at as a sustainable sort of volume number if we would?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace </span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes, I certainly think the trucking industry has an issue there and it's something they're going to need to address going forward and try to attract people into that industry for sure. But clearly, we're quite bullish on your question about the East Coast ports business. We've seen a lot of investment on the East Coast ports. Recently Savannah is undergoing a major construction project and really adding a lot of additional capacity there. And when I was over in Europe and Asia last year, a number of our international steamship line customers are extremely bullish about the prospects of the East Coast ports which we're quite excited about. </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">We've also begun this inland port strategy at CSX which is having tremendous success, our customers are extremely pleased about. So overall Jason, I think, I'm not sure about the prospects of the West Coast ports will -- that's not too much of my concern. But certainly, the East Coast ports we're really pleased with. We got great partners there with all those ports right up and down the coast. And we love them all. They're good partners of ours and we see continued growth there.</p>
<p class="p p3">There was a lot of concern back a couple of years ago with IMO 2020 and how that was all going to -- whether that was going to be a concern, whether the steamship lines were going to sail further to come around to the East Coast that's a nonissue. And so, we see some great business there and we expect that to continue for a long time.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Have any of your channel partners talked about sort of a shift in global supply chains or more people now looking towards Southeast Asia and coming through the Suez?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">They are. Obviously, global supply chains are changing given all the changes that's occurred with the [Indiscernible] and the like. So yes, supply chains aren't changing dramatically. And we think we're in a good position to capture a lot of that growth when it does come into the East Coast.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Perfect. Let's shift a little bit towards your sort of operating ratio. You've done a very impressive job over the years. PSR obviously taken hold earlier at CSX than some of the other ones that are currently in the middle of implementing that operating procedure. Some of the investors that I speak to are worried about that the rate of improvement and it will slow dramatically in the coming years. But again, I would say that you've outstripped people's expectations. So that's the good news. Can we explore some of the steps taken by CSX to continue this impressive track record?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well Jason, I'm glad those people recognize the tremendous success that we have had. And I would say, it's been a lot of work, a lot of hard work. We've got a great team of railroaders here. Great operating team amongst the best that I've ever worked with and a great leadership team and everyone is focused on delivering a superior service product and growing this business. We're always going to have our eye on the operating ratio. I don't think there's a day that goes by that we don't focus on efficiency and being as efficient as possible. We have proven ourselves over the rest 3 years now, can't believe it's been that long, but it's 3.5 years, since this journey began at CSX. We have proven ourselves over that time to be the most efficient railroad in North America. That journey is going to continue. That strive to be the best is going to continue bar none period full stop. So even as we look at bringing on additional volumes and growth, we do so in a way that always has the eye on doing it in the most efficient way.</p>
<p class="p p3">To give you an example, as we sort of came out of the doldrums of the COVID situation and when our auto franchise was virtually flat stopped and the auto production started back up, started to ramp back up and we saw Ford and GM started to reopen some of their facilities. They started off as you know with one shift. Some of the volumes started off very slowly. Typically, that volume moves out of those plants in unit trains. But because the volume was sort of lumpy and was very soft at the beginning, we took those volumes and shipped them in existing merchandise train service. So we are absorbing those volumes in sort of at low very incremental cost to us until such time is justified putting on another train start to handle sort of the unit train volumes again.</p>
<p class="p p3">So those are types of things that we look at constantly every day. We've got additional capacity on this railroad. So every time we get a new piece of business or we're going after a new piece of business, we're able to absorb that into our existing train starts, very low incremental cost, high incremental margin. And those are all the types of efficiencies. I think if you talk to Jamie and the operating team, they're always still looking for opportunities within our yards to do things better more efficiently. How do we spend capital in the right ways to lower our cost basis and be more efficient?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">So, there's a lot of initiatives across the railroad as we continue this journey to be the best and continue this journey to have the lowest operating ratio out there. And that journey is going to continue and we're always going to keep our eye on the ball there.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, Mark you mentioned sort of adding that incremental business to your trains. Where do you think you have the most opportunity to add to those train lines? Is it intermodal? Is it merchandise? Is it something else?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I would say it's both intermodal and merchandise. As I said we do have -- we talked pre-COVID levels, we were talking 30% additional capacity on existing train starts. And we have line of road capacity as well. So, we have ample capacity across the railroad. And as we do look at sitting down with our customers talking to them especially in this time Jason when businesses are challenged things are tough out there our shippers our customers are looking to save a buck and we're able to go in and sit down with our customers and show us your book of business, show us your lanes where you're shipping.</p>
<p class="p p4">A lot of our customers we recognize both ship by rail and ship by truck. If we're able to go in -- especially as we talked about earlier with the trucking rates skyrocketing these days going in and able to have those conversations with them and say listen, we know even before these truck rates took off, we were still 10%, 12%, 15% cheaper than the truck. Now, we're even more cheaper than the truck because the rates have gone up so dramatically. We've got a superior service. We've got reliability and consistency. We've demonstrated it to you over the last couple of years that we are on a different kind of railroad.</p>
<p class="p p4">Let us -- give us a shot in some of these lanes where we haven't traditionally played. Give us some of that business. I think you're seeing that some of that benefit in our weekly volumes as we continue to sort of outpace in some areas some of our competition and being able to convert a lot of that highway traffic onto the railroad.</p>
<p class="p p4">So, we're extremely pleased with the progress we've been able to achieve over the last couple of months and that journey is going to continue. And I think the more we can demonstrate to our customers that we're different, that we're better than we ever have been and that we're cheaper and we can do a really good job for them. I think once we get that volume and we continue to do really well for them over the time, then that becomes a lot stickier. And that business just won't migrate down back to the highway once trucking rates over time moderate. So, it's our job to continue to do a good job and be there for our customers and do what we say we're going to do.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So, you mentioned being cheaper. You said before you knew you were cheaper. You said now you think you're in excess of 15% cheaper.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Correct. Correct. And a lot of -- and again it depends on the lane. It depends on the product and the customers and stuff. But clearly given -- it's just not -- these high trucking rates just don't impact intermodal. We know a lot of our merchandise customers whether it's paper, whether it's metals, or whether it's minerals, whether it's aggregates, whether it's whatever steel, they are using that spot market to ship some of their product. And we know those rates are going up and we're able to offer an alternative to them with truck-like service.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">And getting back to sort of that longer term OR outlook is your physical network where it needs to be or are you guys still potentially going to make some more changes around that into the future?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. No, I mean clearly we've done a lot right? I mean I don't think we're going to be closing eight more hump yards anytime soon. We don't have eight more hump yards to close. Clearly, we've done a lot on the operating side. Always as I said earlier, always looking for opportunities to continue to push the envelope and do things better and more efficiently.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5">On the intermodal side, we went through 18 months of rail rationalization. We've gotten that network now on our intermodal side to where we really like it. We don't expect any more changes there. Listen, we're always looking for opportunities. If we see a high-return project where we think we could have -- we could spend some capital and get a very, very high return on that project, then we're looking to do that, we would do that. Nothing on the horizon.</p>
<p class="p p5">So from a capital perspective, I don't see anything really material that's going to change our view of sort of where we are every year sort of that $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion outlook. Really there's nothing I see that would have us deviate from that.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So longer-term as CSX grows its revenues, your CapEx as a percent of revenues is actually going to go down?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Exactly. I mean, listen, again, we've got capacity in our terminals. We've got capacity. We've got additional locomotives that are still store -- stored. There's nothing that I see right now that would cause us to materially have to reinvest. Now if we grew 20%, 30% would we have to extend the citing here or there and spend a couple of million bucks? No big deal.</p>
<p class="p p5">I think we've got the cash flow to be able to justify that. But really Jason, I don't think given all the changes that we've made over the last couple of years, there's really no significant capital needs required to accommodate a lot of growth going forward.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Well, I hope your sales and operating team have to get together for that 20% or 30%.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">It will do change…</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">That will be a nice problem to come across your desk.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">It would. So far they're not panicking yet. So -- but I just tell them to just give me a couple a year or two.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">There you go. I want to jump to the STB now. They recently sent a letter to CSX and I want to say every other railroad, so this wasn't just a CSX letter expressing their concerns about sort of service quality across the industry.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">What do you think CSX and some of the other railroads are going to be doing sort of going forward to make sure that the service doesn't head south as the recovery continues? And what sort of conversations are you having with the STB on an ongoing basis?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure. No, it's a great question. Jason listen, I think, the regulator is doing what the regulator should be doing putting us on notice that they're continuing to watch which is important for all of us to remember and to be cognizant of.</p>
<p class="p p5">Listen, we went through a quarter unlike any quarter that any of us have ever experienced before in our -- certainly in my career. I don't think anybody has ever seen a quarter like what we went through. I mean, at the trough of the quarter in Q2 volumes were down 26%, and then within six weeks started to rebound significantly. And so that volatility was extremely hard to deal with.</p>
<p class="p p5">I mean, we didn't know how long this COVID situation was going to last. We obviously had to furlough employees just because volumes were down 26%. We had about 1,000 people on furlough maybe a little bit more. And then when the volume started to come back we quickly started recalling them under their collective agreements. They have two weeks to come back to work. And then there was all these bumping issues going on and so -- and relocation issues with employees going everywhere.</p>
<p class="p p5">So it was a challenging period, no question not only for CSX, but for the entire industry. I would give the industry a lot of credit for how we managed this thing. It was extremely challenging out there. And I think we are focused on getting our service levels back to where they were pre-COVID. I'm happy to report from a trip planning compliance, we are inches within attaining where we were back pre-COVID levels.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6">For Intermodal, we're sort of low 90s. We're kind of 95%, 96%, right before COVID hit. We're sort of 91%, 92%, 93%, depending on the day right now. Merchandise on trip plan compliance, we're sort of low 80s. We're sort of 86%, 87%, pre-COVID. And so, we're right at the precipice of being able to get back our service levels where they were.</p>
<p class="p p6">There's still a lot of challenges out there, still lumpiness in the volumes and challenges. But our operating team has done just a remarkable job. And they deserve a lot of credit for handling this type of volatility, in just a very short period of time. And so listen, we're focused on getting our service back to where it was being, extremely truck-light competitive, the consistency and the reliability that our customers have come to expect of us.</p>
<p class="p p6">We're really, really close. We're almost there. We've been talking with our -- I think more importantly, keeping our customers in the loop about what's going on. Before they call us we're reaching out to them, being very proactive. I give our customer engagement team, our customer service team a lot of credit. They've had their hands full the last couple of months, dealing with a lot of these issues and working with our customers.</p>
<p class="p p6">And as we were coming out of this situation with COVID, I mean obviously, a lot of our shippers were looking to get their product to market, as soon as possible. And they needed us to be there, immediately. And unfortunately in some cases we just weren't. And we weren't able to be, like we wanted to be just because of some of the situation with the crews and other things.</p>
<p class="p p6">And so, -- but we're back. We're happy. We're communicating with the STB. We sent in a reply last week, telling them everything all the initiatives that we're working on. And I think again, it's communicating with the regulator, informing them and keeping them up to speed on everything that we're doing.</p>
<p class="p p6">But more importantly, it's actually talking with our customers and making sure that they are informed of all the plans and all the things on the initiatives that we're doing to ensure that their products get to market with the type of reliability and consistency that they've come to expect from CSX.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">That's a great way to segue into my final question for you. And then, you can jump to some of the questions here, from the audience. And again reminding the audience to please go into the chat and give your questions like some people already have. What's CSX doing now differently than they've done in the past to interface with their customers?</p>
<p class="p p6">I've been a member of NEARS now, North East Association of Rail Shippers for almost 20 years, been on the Board forever. And that's the one thing that always comes up with shippers in railroads. It's that connectivity piece. And they've always wanted better communications.</p>
<p class="p p6">But I know CSX has been at the forefront there. And they've been trying a lot of new things. Can you give us an update on, what you're doing differently now? And what some of the things that you plan to do, coming down the road. Are that may have been delayed because of COVID?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Sure. It's a great question, Jason. And listen, one of the things that I think I've tried to bring to my role here, is really two things. And you mentioned it about communications and I think, we often -- as we learned through the changes. And I go back even to my days at CN and CP as well, when we were, as you know making -- implementing scheduled railroading and moving very, very quickly.</p>
<p class="p p6">And like we did at, CSX moved very quickly to implement a lot of changes. And sometimes our communications didn't keep up with the pace of the change operationally. And so part of my commitment when I went into this role was ensuring that our customers had proper communications were always informed. We're staying in touch with them. We brought back what I call the customer engagement [Technical Difficulty] about 30 to 40 customers here to Jacksonville every year out by the beach and -- for a couple of days.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">And Jim, myself, Jamie and Kevin we spend -- and my team spend two days with customers; dinner and one-on-one settings etcetera and group chats talking to them about everything that we're trying to do and get their feedback and their concerns and their issues and really over-communicate. And I've been doing that through this whole COVID situation with regular communications there. And I think that's very, very important.</p>
<p class="p p7">I think secondly -- the second priority was transparency -- and transparency into our service. And I feel very, very committed to this. It's something that -- I've been pushing very hard at CSX. That's why when we introduced trip plans, I felt it was extremely important that our customers have total transparency into their trip plan performance.</p>
<p class="p p7">We put out trip plan performance now for intermodal customers and for merchandise customers on our ShipCSX tool. For intermodal customers, it's to the minute. So from gate to gate to the minute no leeway, for merchandise again it's to the hour. In hours not in days like it used to be. And we tell them how we're doing with each and every railcar that they ship on CSX, we give them how we performed to their trip plans for every railcar for every lane they ship in.</p>
<p class="p p7">That type of transparency, that type of honesty it really puts the onus on us to be good because we know that our customers are going out there on the website and seeing how we're performing on a daily measure. And my argument was always, they feel our service. They know how we're doing. Now we're just showing it to them. We're being open and transparent and showing it to them.</p>
<p class="p p7">And I think that's really, really important. And it builds a level of trust and a different conversation with our customers that I think they've really appreciated. I think they recognize now we're doing what we said we were going to do. They may not have believed us a couple of years ago when we started this journey, but we've proved to them that what we told them we were going to do, we're doing and we're putting our money where our mouth is and our feet where our mouth is and we're actually showing to them now the full-service product that we are delivering.</p>
<p class="p p7">So I think those two areas of transparency and communication are something that I'm really passionate about and are going to continue into the future.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well I'm sure the customers -- the customer feedback has to be positive on that especially, I mean if you're showing them up to the minute. And there's a little more they can ask for...</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Intermodal there's nowhere to hide. There's no wiggle room.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well you've got tough competition so you have to do that right?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">That's right. Exactly. We have demanding customers and they should be demanding.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, I want to switch over here because I know we're limited a little bit on time to some of the questions from the clients. So let me start here from a question here. Anecdotally from shippers, it seems that the sales strategy at CSX is to come up with a competitive price and get to a better customer experience.</p>
<p class="p p7">Then when the renewal comes the price -- and when the price and service is where it needs to be this is a better customer value proposition. How do you think the path going forward to the maturation of price in the customer portfolio is going to look? Could we begin to see a meaningful step-up in RPU in the coming years as some of your 2018 and 2019 growth comes up for renewal?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">So listen, my job and our job here is to deliver a superior service product to our customers. That's what they pay for. That's what they demand, give them the transparency, give them the information they need and give them -- and just do what you say you're going to do and be consistent and reliable. With that, comes our expectation that we're not a commodity that we've worked really, really, really hard at this company to put this service in place. And we feel that for that, we expect a reasonable rate increase on that transportation product every year. And it's my job to demonstrate to our customers just what the value that they are receiving from CSX, what that means to them in their supply chains.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">We are still cheaper as we talked about in the truck. We are putting in place and we have in many instances put in place a truck-like competitive service. And I think feedback from some of our channel partner customers and others have attested to that. And so, yes, I believe over time, as we sit down on the renewals every year with our customers and look back and talk about growth and opportunities for us to do more for them and show them the true value of our service and what we can do for them and be partners and grow together that I think over time, we are going to consistently keep getting those reasonable price increases and I'm not [audio gap] year, but reasonable earned price increases every year and...</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">In excess of cost inflation?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Absolutely. Absolutely. And we'll keep doing that. And that's our strategy. And again, we want to -- we're not a commodity. We're not going to be just arbitrage between the truck and the other guy and all this kind of stuff. We feel, we have a great service product and we expect to be paid for it and those lead to good conversations with customers.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="question">Jason Seidl</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Perfect. Let me jump to another one here. Since more traffic is interline than single line and customers measure performance from origin destination not interchange, when in your plan do you expect to be able to be reporting on a full trip basis?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Mark Wallace</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">So, it's an excellent question. We're having those conversations right now actually with our short-line partners. And a lot of them have this type of information and now it's just linking the two, so we can actually give our shippers a full view of their trip plans. With respect to our Class I partners, again, I think we've had various levels of success there, some like-minded railroads that we are very familiar with. Those conversations are ongoing and we're pleased with that. Because I couldn't agree more the customers want the full trip plan view not just a portion on CSX.</p>
<p class="p p8">And as we know, 50% of our business either originates or terminates on another railroad. And so for those customers that we hand business off to whether it's a short line or to another Class I, we can only for now give them a real comprehensive view of their service on CSX. That's good. That's important. That's one step.</p>
<p class="p p8">But we know as an industry, we need to do better. And I think, hopefully over time, others will agree and we'll start to actually get together and participate and start to show customers a holistic view of their entire supply chain.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Jason Seidl</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Well, perfect. Well listen, I think we'll end it on that note there. Again, I can't get to every question that we've had here because we simply don't have the time but it's...</p>

<p class="p p8">Send them to me, I'll respond via e-mail.</p>

<p class="p p8">Great to see you Mark and Bill, I want to thank you again and please give my best to the men and women at CSX who are just helping keeping this supply chain moving during these times. It's -- their work is greatly appreciated on our end. That's for sure.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Mark Wallace</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thank you, Jason and thanks everybody and hope to see you soon. And thanks for your time this morning. Appreciate it.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Jason Seidl</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Got it. And everyone up next is going to be Union Pacific at 8:40. Thank you.</p></div>
