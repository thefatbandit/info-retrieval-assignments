<p class="p p1"><span> </span><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span><span>All right. We’re here back. Thanks, everybody, for joining us here for the 12:35 Eastern session. I’m Walter Pritchard, software analyst at Citi. Happy to have with us Pat Gelsinger, who is the CEO of VMware. And it’s become a tradition here. I think we missed you last year, Pat, but tradition to do sort of a lunchtime keynote with you. So, thanks for joining.</span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span><span>My pleasure. Great to be with you, again, Walter. And looks like you’ve landed from some other orange planet there a little bit. What a weird day we have here in the Bay Area, so.</span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span><span>I’m in Orange-freaking County. Anyway, I did want to mention before we get started that just a quick Safe Harbor there. The statements made in these discussions, which are not statements of historical fact, are forward looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including those referenced in VMware’s most recent SEC filings on Forms 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K.</span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span><span>So I was going to go through a number of questions I had prepared here for Pat. There is a question tab on the interface that everybody has for the conference. And if anybody has any questions, you can submit those and I’ll go through and incorporate those into the discussion.</span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span><span>So, one thing I wanted to just mention upfront is, I wanted Pat, you to give us any update, if there was, on the Dell separation matter. I wasn’t going to spend time talking about that. But if there’s anything to say there, I wanted you to go ahead and do that and then we’ll go through the rest of the discussion?</span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span><span>Sure. Thank you, Walter, and really nothing new to say at all there. Obviously, based on the filing by Dell, we formed the special committee of our independent directors. As we said, a spin-off could occur before September of next year, that would be the earliest that it would be possible.</span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span><span>Anything that we do, our objective would be to be value-enhancing to the full breadth of stakeholders. And from a customer and partner lens, it would be continuing the good momentum, even as we potentially broaden some of the reach and ecosystem activities of the company. Beyond that, I can’t really comment further at this time.</span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span><span>Okay, great. Well, thanks for that. So I guess, wanted to start with, you recently reported your second quarter results in the last two weeks. And I think all companies are operating in this fairly unprecedented time, both from public health situation, as well as from just the macro impacts that, that has brought. Can you talk about what impacts you’re seeing from the current environment on your business? I think we saw some of that in Q2, but would love to hear a summary of that first?</span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span><span>Yes. As we look at the quarter and as you’ve heard me said on the earnings call, a solid quarter for us. So, pleased with our execution. Our teams have adjusted to work from home. In fact, we’ve got to the point now that we said, the new work model begins today, right? We’re not looking to go back, right? We view and have embraced this distributed work model, new policies, changing our campus plans, et cetera, to make this part of how we work in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p p1"><span> </span><span>When we click on the business, probably the biggest theme we saw was some pressure on the on-premise portions of the business, but great growth in the subscription and SaaS areas of the business offsetting some of that. We also saw very strong strategic interest from customers continue.</span></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span><span>We had 22 deals over $10 million. So, this idea of vetting on and partnering with VMware and increasing attach of the five franchises, as we say, our multi-cloud, your modern applications, our networking, the intrinsic security and our Workspace solutions, increasingly, we’re seeing customers buy into the full value proposition of VMware.</span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span><span>And when we think about some of the individual businesses like the VMware on AWS offering, another quarter of triple-digit growth. So, we’re clearly seeing some of these hot areas start to really be delivering at scale as well. So that would be a quick summary, but very happy with the teams, even as we navigate through what I’ve called the swoosh sort of recovery, where we expect Q2 and Q3 to be the sort of most difficult quarters.</span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span><span>Got it. And you hit on it already, the subscription and SaaS traction that you saw in the business. Can you talk about what’s driving that from a product perspective? What’s driving that in terms of your own sort of intended behavior around the way you’re going to market? And then sort of what’s going on in the industry that and the economic times that are driving the purchases in that manner?</span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span><span>Yes. So, let’s start with the economic piece, and we’ll sort of work our way back from there. Obviously, there has been a trend to an accelerating growth subscription SaaS and cloud. The idea that you run it for me versus me running it. It’s capitalized in your environment versus mine, that’s been a positive trend now for a while.</span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span><span>And in this COVID, where every aspect of – I couldn’t get into my data centers, a number of those projects were pressured, where acceleration in subscription and SaaS. So that, I’d say, we saw that across the industry and I think you saw that in the earnings of a variety of players.</span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span><span>And even as we see, over a longer-term, a recovery of that on-premise spend that I’m sure we’ll touch on that a little bit more. We do think that the subscription and SaaS acceleration is something critical for us and for the industry. Now for us, we’re now 22% of our revenue is subscription and SaaS, 40-plus percent growth rate this last quarter, all of our products and our objective would be that we get to the point of indifference.</span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span><span>And we’re working that by next year, essentially, every one of our five franchises has good embodiments as subscription and SaaS.</span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span><span> So the customer could sort of say, “Oh, I want to be able to buy more on-prem. No, I changed my mind, we’re going to buy more of it as cloud and they’re going to be able to buy all five of our franchises, either on-premise or as subscription services.” And we’ll be making a number of more announcements at VMworld of some of those next moves in that regard, so just a couple of weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span><span>And ultimately, we think it gives our business model more flexibility, gives our customers more flexibility. And ultimately, we’ll be positioned as the only major software infrastructure company at scale, that’s both on-premise and in the cloud, multi-cloud across a broad segregate set of offerings. That’s a pretty powerful value proposition for us to have.</span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span><span>How do you think about, I mean, high level, what needs to sort of be done on your end to enable that? I mean, some of these products like AirWatch is already there. I think, in fact, it’s preferred on the SaaS side, and then you have your kind of core SDDC business, where like this has been in people’s data centers for going on 20 years now.</span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span><span>And then, your go-to-market around that is very heavily centered on the on-prem data center model. What needs to happen on the VMware side to get this moving in the direction that you talked about?</span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p2"><span> </span><span>Yes. Some of it’s in the products, where we have to bring more cloud value. And we’ve just launched the full suite, for instance, of the management products. Our vRealize products are now fully offered as subscription services. But that was a lot of the engineering work in the product.</span></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span><span>In some cases like vSphere, NSX, vSAN, while they will largely be on premise products, we’re also going to be adding value from cloud-delivered services, support, updates, management, other things that we can do as a subscription offering. So some of it’s what we have to do in the products and we’re one by one going through that engineering work. Some of it’s also going to be in how we transact them and relate to the customers, Walter, right, because we’re going to give them more flexibility in how they transact with VMware.</span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span><span>And where we’re going would be is, I would like, let’s say, 10 units of infrastructure. We’ll say, “Great, here you go.” And I got 10 units, gives me 1,000 workloads worth, that’s great. How are you going to use them this week? Are they going to be on-premise or in the cloud?</span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span><span>So increasingly, we’re going to give customers more flexibility to even at a transactional basis, be able to have that choice across it as well. So part of it’s the product, part of it’s the business relationship that we have with the customers. And then increasingly, we have to get the sand out of our gears in terms of making that the primary sales motion, being able to enable all of our customer support customer success to really materialize that flexibility for our customers at scale.</span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span><span>So a lot of work to do, but we’ve come a long way already and I really see getting to that point of indifference from both the business and the products happens for us about a year from now.</span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span><span>Okay. Got it. And from a customer perspective, I guess, what are your customers telling you about, especially on those core franchises they’ve been transacting with and made strategic bets on with VMware? What are they telling you around how they want to buy? Because, again, I think there is sort of a spread of like those here?</span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span><span>Yes. It really ends up being quite specific to different market segments. And as we looked and I mentioned on the call, the three strongest areas or verticals for us in our second-half pipeline is financial, public sector and telco. And all three of those tend to be much more on-premise…</span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span><span>Right.</span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span><span>….they’re capitalized into the network, financial services tends to be pretty conservative and their move to cloud and public sector, handling of personal data, government data, et cetera. So if anything, they’re more biased to on-premise, even as they might say, over a three, four or five-year period, I want more cloud consumption.</span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span><span>For them, it’s clearly on-premise bias. Whereas other segments are saying, “Oh, I’m making the move to cloud period. We’ve made that decision and we’re going to have maybe 20%, maybe 50%, maybe even 80% of our infrastructure will be placed in the cloud over the next three years.”</span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span><span>And when you go to retail, supply chain, distribution, all of those are moving much more rapidly to a cloud-first, if not, in some cases, a cloud-only model. But we do expect that it’s a very hybrid world, right, a multi-cloud world. And that’s where we’re positioning VMware to sit firmly in the middle of that ability to do both and enable customers to be doing both.</span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span><span>And the economics now are demonstrating and we have big customers who’ve shown this, that consistently is 30% cheaper if it’s on-premise. And we can achieve up to 50% if it’s hybrid, leveraging both the dynamic scale of public, as well as the cost dynamics of private, we can achieve a 50% reduction in their overall operational costs. Those are big numbers, right, for anybody running infrastructure at scale.</span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p3"><span> </span><span>Right. Got it. And then I think another way to look at this is, maybe more on the traditional side, not as much on the EUC piece. But workload growth in the on-prem world and in the cloud world, how do you think about – I think, as a</span><span> </span><span>couple of years ago, VMworld, you threw out some workload numbers and growth rates and so forth.</span></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>How do you think about the workload growth on-prem? How do you think about the workload growth in the cloud, the mix of those and sort of what that means, just as a sort of input into VMware’s underlying growth rate as we look forward?</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>Yes. Generally, I made some predictions three years ago that we would crossover and hit 50-50 in 2022, in calendar 2022. If anything, COVID might accelerate that crossover point a little bit, right? And for, you’re seeing 30%, 40% growth rate in public cloud, 10-ish percentage growth rates in private cloud workloads. COVID has probably tilted that a little bit more in this interim period of time.</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>Now, I’ve also talked about what I call the three laws, Walter, right? The three laws of hybrid cloud, laws of physics, laws of economics and laws of the land, right? If you think about the sectors I talked about, public sector, laws of the land. We shall run in a German data center, right, here in Germany. I mean, there’s very strong regulatory for some segments of the marketplace, they’re going to stay heavily on-premise.</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>In laws of physics, the telco market, edge. When you’re trying to do a 10 millisecond, right, response time, you can’t do 100 millisecond round trip to the cloud. 5G edge will usher in more premise-based infrastructure over time. And then finally, the laws of economics, which we already touched on.</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>So we’re expecting a balance point in that 50%, 60% range in the public cloud, which we expect that we achieve at about over the next two, three, four years and then they’ll moderate more 5G and edge will drive a market increase in the amount of edge infrastructure that will get built out as well over that period of time. But we do see it as a hybrid world, not as a way station, but as the future as well.</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>So, we believe our strategy is well positioned, and we’re seeing that bear out in the pipeline and in customer strategies, even as they want more flexibility to make those choices in a more dynamic way over time.</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>It makes sense. And then I think that, to some degree, that workload – the workload model has been used by investors to sort of think about you have compute growth where for a little bit of time they ran ahead of, I think, where you thought it would sustainably, it slowed down, as you talked about with some of these headwinds. You’ve had the network and storage businesses that have been growing faster.</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>How do you think about articulating a framework to investors, given subscription and given this shifting in the workloads, as it relates to the compute and storage and network? Is that still the way to think about things? Or do you think it becomes more of a holistic sort of growth driver?</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>Yes. I think workloads remains an important one, not the only one, because devices drives the EUC business, number of developers is more driving of the modern applications of business. But workloads is a very important metric for us.</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>And obviously, for us, and I’ll update the workload numbers at VMworld in a couple of weeks. I’ll give some specific updates on some of those workload growth rates, workload counts that we’re seeing. And, again, we’ve been, I think, you’re quite accurate compared to some of the other analysts in the industries in some of our views there. So you’ll see more in a couple of weeks there.</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>The other aspect of that for us, Walter, is that we use that workload as a platform for other products…</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>Right.</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>…because when I – I’m running the workload in a VM, now I’m increasingly attaching the storage stack, increasingly attaching the security service to it, increasingly leveraging it into the developer space with Tanzu on top of VCF.</span></p>
<p class="p p4"><span> </span><span>So we really use that to expand the value proposition that we give to our customers, as we move from one franchise to two to three, all the way to five franchises of the complete VMware solution. And we’ll have a number of major announcements in this respect at VMworld exactly with that in mind.</span></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span><span>Got it. Got it. And then as we think about on the modern application side, you acquired pivotal, you had your own efforts in that area, you’ve combined them together. And maybe first wanted to start with just the articulation of the value proposition for your modern application stack. I mean, there are a lot of modern application stacks out there everything from the sort of Red Hat, IBM stack to going natively into a public cloud to the number of startups that have product here. But how are you trying to differentiate and make sure you get your fair share of that market, given its potential from a workload growth perspective over time?</span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span><span>Yes. And we’re definitely – we’re pursuing a couple of different aspects of that, that we think that nicely differentiate us versus the alternatives. One is this direct integration into the infrastructure layer. And we said, well, vSphere, it runs VMs and containers, right?</span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span><span>I’m running Kubernetes today, it’s hard, right? It’s immature. And we’re saying, “Oh, not an issue. If you can run VMware, you can run Kubernetes.” That’s a big differentiator for us. And we just sort of, as I said, we want to pave the world with VMware Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span><span>Second would be that just like our cloud strategy is a multi-strategy, so is our developer Kubernete strategy as well? And are sort of saying, “Yes, you could choose the Amazon-only route or you could choose the Google-only route. But if you choose VMware, you’ve given yourself on-premise and multi-cloud flexibility.</span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span><span>Well, that’s pretty differentiated, right? Because we’re going to say, “Your developer teams can develop without having to necessarily decide, which cloud this week is running that workload. “ And remember, when they’re developing, huh, you might get to a different answer when you’re running that in Germany than if you were running that in New York, right, for customers in different segments as well.</span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span><span>So that is a powerful answer to separate the developer decisions from the infra decisions and to give you that multi-cloud flexibility, just like we’re doing with our infrastructure products, that’s a second major differentiator.</span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span><span>Third is, we’re saying to the developer themselves, we want to be one of those cool kids that are very much dedicated to open source upstream compatibility. And we’re now the number two contributor to the open source community around Kubernetes and well on our way to be a leader in so many different aspects of that and we’re leveraging places that we already have like Spring.</span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span><span>And Spring is the dominant enterprise Java development community. And now we’re building the bridges for that into a Kubernetes world as well. So those will be some of the unique things that we bring to that discussion.</span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span><span>And the degree to which we then make it easy for the enterprise customers to say, “Hey, I’m already leveraging VMware for this multi-cloud and on-premise infrastructure, and I’ve just snapped into their developer layer, that solves a huge tension point or builds a massive bridge between the developer and the infra an ops teams.” We’re pretty uniquely positioned to make that happen.</span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span><span>Got it. And not to steal too much thunder from from VMworld here. We usually have VMworld the week before this, right? So we usually talked about what came out of VMworld.</span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span><span>Yes. Sorry. Go ahead.</span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p5"><span> </span><span>VMworld is coming up. So but on the time line around, so I think the vision is well understood. The timeline just around deliverables and you’ve had these Tanzu and Project Pacific and new version of vSphere that has Kubernetes as a first-class citizen. How do you think about – or what should investors watch for as the real tangible milestones here with product releases and opportunities to talk about customer traction after those releases are happening?</span></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span><span>Yes. So, some of the launches happened earlier in the year, so we’re starting to see the uptick. And as we said in the Q2 results, the modern apps business unit for me beats our plan by a bit, not by a huge amount, but getting that first quarter that they beat plan was a pretty big milestone for them, but we’ll have some major updates at VMworld, which will shift shortly thereafter.</span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span><span>So we expect as we get this really integrated solution into vSphere, that our customer counts – my objective is, is that we start exploding the customer counts. Pivotal had hundreds of customers. We want to go to tens of thousands and then hundreds of thousands of customers. We just finished SpringOne last week, where we have 40,000 developers participating.</span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span><span>So now we’re starting to really reach a much broader developer community as well. But ultimately, it has to land in the business results of the company. And as we’re navigating through the integration, the move to Kubernetes, we expect those to start being more material contributions next year.</span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span><span>Got it. And then going back to I ask you about compute, network storage and so forth. As we think about – I look at the VMC offering, for example, that you have with AWS and storage and networking are just part of the offering. You don’t sort of choose those as optional.</span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span><span>And I think when we started out with network and storage, they were kind of optional add-ons. How do you think about with the container architecture that you’re deploying, the role of the network product, NSX and associated and same on the storage side? How – are those sort of required integral parts? Are they options? And how does that help in the growth picture?</span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span><span>Yes. It’s sort of yes and yes, because we’re saying, we want to make it super, super easy. If you’re on our container Kubernetes platform to go into our networking solution or our security solution or our management solution. If we make that dreadfully easy, lots of customers go down that path, right? Developers get to say, “Oh, I get to be pragmatically lazy, as I like to call developers. It’s not like they’re "lazy," but they want to be super pragmatic, and they want to write code, get it production, they don’t want to worry about a lot of those issues.</span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span><span>And if I make it easy for them to do that, they’ll go down that path. At the same time, NSX is a complex platform with many, many capabilities. And you can’t expose those challenges to the developer community. They need very, very simple on-ramps that don’t necessarily have to address all of those complexities of a multi-zone, firewalled network solution. Hey, I just want to be able to connect containers together, and I want to be able to automatically scale and load balance them. That’s all the developer wants to worry about.</span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span><span>So, we need to sort of hit that sweet spot of developer-friendly and simple, as well as enterprise-scalable and complete. And we’re going to make a couple of announcements, specifically, uniquely in the networking area at VMworld as we help address some of that, I’ll say, the gap between those two worlds. But that’s an area that I think we’re pretty uniquely positioned to help satisfy in the industry.</span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span><span>Got it. And I guess, I mentioned the VMC offering in that last question. How do you – what sort of update would you give at this point around traction on the VMC offering? I think when we talked in the past, there has been a few very clear value propositions around that. Maybe just let’s start out generally and then wanted to maybe dive in on some of those specific value propositions?</span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p6"><span> </span><span>Yes. Overall, solution is gaining good momentum. And as I said, when you hit the two-year point for an enterprise offering, you now are mature enough that you can start to scale. We hit that point in November of last year. And ever since then, it really has been ramping quite rapidly triple-digit growth again.</span></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span><span>One of the things as well that we touched on is that, Amazon is now scaling their dedicated sales force. So we have a dedicated sales force. Amazon has a dedicated sales force and they’re now partnering at scale. I would say this is really starting to generate shared momentum in the marketplace, a good quarter for roadmap updates, as well as we have the two-node, alternative, new storage cost to optimize the solution. We just did the Datrium acquisition for DR and resilience to make that another use case.</span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span><span>So we’re seeing data center extension, data center replacement, bursting of capacity, DR, somewhat the key use cases. We also have a handful of, I’ll say, developer use cases as well, you’re pretty excited to see that they’re finding this to be the best place to develop and then you have a hybrid deployment model as well. So that’s one that’s going to become more important to us in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span><span>Got it. And the opportunities around you’ve talked about the laws of cloud with the law of the land being one of them. What are you seeing specifically with customers with VMC and related cloud services in the sort of sovereignty data residency side of things?</span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span><span>Yes. And that becomes an increasingly important topic and we had a couple of big APJ wins that were VMC-centric in partnership with Amazon. And part of the reason the customer chose was running in availability zones in certain sovereign nations. They also – the VMC offering also has inherent resilience capabilities that are very important for those class of workloads as well, where improved HA resilience capabilities, a native part of the VMware stack is enhancing.</span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span><span>So it’s both sovereignty as well as resilience, which, if anything, in a post-COVID environment, has become more important to the customers as well. We’re clicking off some of the key regulatory approvals, both domestically as well as internationally as well to make it more appealing for some of those, I’ll say, bread-and-butter public sector, financial sector use cases as well. So very nice growth in that and a lot of pipeline for us to execute in those areas.</span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span><span>And then you mentioned Datrium. And so I guess, one thing that I’ve come to appreciate, even though covering this market for a long time, the stickiness of the disaster recovery architectures that some of these customers have, I mean, they’ve built their own data centers. They’re occupying third-party data centers with sometimes longer-term contracts.</span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span><span>What is – how much of the sort of potential success in the sort of DR backup area with VMC is sort of under your control with engineering the solution and so forth versus just the resistance to change that some of those customers may have in architectures they’ve deployed in the past?</span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span><span>Yes. And I do think this is one that the time is soon upon us, where – and as you apply in your question, Walter, people change their developer tools as often as they change religions, and they change their backup environments even less frequently.</span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span><span>Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span><span>Just once you get them done, and if they’re not broken, they just don’t change. But I think now in a multi-cloud world, where they’re making these fundamental replatforming, rehosting decisions, we think many of those DR and backup solutions will come into a multi-cloud world. That’s what got me super excited about the Datrium acquisition.</span></p>
<p class="p p7"><span> </span><span>The team is super talented. They’ve done a really elegant job of building that solution essentially, as it is today, and we’ll broaden this over time. But as it is today, essentially, you’re backing up into the super low-cost S-3 resource and then you hydrate into the VMC service with very good RPO and RTO. Now, that kind of offering is very compelling across so many use cases.</span></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span><span>I’m going to start with bundling it with VxRail’s on-premise, right? We’re going to start building it as new use cases for VMC more broadly. And everybody’s DR architecture, particularly in a post-COVID world needs to be improved. So I’m quite excited about that opportunity. It’s going to become a really compelling growth driver for VMC over the next couple of years. And the cost of our current DR solution in a cloud model isn’t that effective. This one is very compelling instead, so I’m quite looking forward.</span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span><span>Got it. Great. And then I guess, as a follow-up on the VMC, more on the go-to-market side. I think you’d realigned your – or optimize the go-to-market with Amazon with their sales force. Can you put a finer point on sort of what impact that could have in terms of taking the customers – taking this offering to a broader set of customers and integrated into their go-to-market?</span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span><span>Yes. Amazon has just shown up to be a good partner for us, quite excited. And Andy and I speak regularly on these topics. We do joint sales calls together. And when the two CEOs are joining a sales call, trust me, everybody in the sales force hears about it, big opportunities that we’re executing together.</span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span><span>The other customer behavior that’s important is customers are making big commitments to Amazon through what they call their EDP agreements. And now VMC is eligible to consume their EDP credits or to drive EDP discounts. So big cloud customers are very favorable to taking their VMC service through the Amazon channel and through the Amazon EDP agreements, because it helps them for all of their cloud uses, right, and billing to lower the cost and increase higher discounts sooner.</span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span><span>So a lot of momentum to that piece of it, and we’re building out more services with them. Everyday, we’re just introducing more services, more use cases, like the two-node more marketplace opportunities, et cetera.</span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span><span>So overall, as customers are moving to an increasingly cloud consumption model, Amazon is at the front of that parade, and we are now becoming one of the key tools in their solution set, because customers have seen this 4x faster cloud migration.</span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span><span>You’re now talking about 10% 4x faster, one-fifth the cost of them to migrate to the VMware cloud versus rehosting in the native cloud services. These are compelling economics, 30% to 50% TCO, right, on a per workload basis. So now the economics are really starting to play into a great shared sales motion.</span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span><span>Got it. And when we think about the Microsoft offering, the Google offering, I mean, I think the vision is very clear here, it’s multi-cloud. How far behind are those offerings? And do you expect those to have the similar level of service</span><span> </span><span>go-to-market alignment? Just help us draw the distinction between those different offerings, understanding that the Amazon one is well out ahead?</span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span><span>Yes. And we just launched the offerings or Google just launched and Microsoft just announced, they’ll be launching shortly the general availability of those solutions. So I’ll say, all of our multi-cloud pieces, they’re falling into place as we speak. That said, we’re just at the very earliest stages of pipeline build, executing customers onto the service, et cetera.</span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span><span>But we’ve learned a lot from the Amazon partnership Google and VMware, Microsoft and VMware, we will have dedicated unique joint sales motions, where we have dedicated sellers that are selling together, pushing this through our geographic teams together. We learned a lot in terms of how to do cloud migrations or hybrid cloud services.</span></p>
<p class="p p8"><span> </span><span>So there clearly is a gap between Amazon as our preferred lead partner, and Google, Microsoft, Alibaba and the others. But we do see that gap closing, because they’re going to leverage many of the learnings that we’ve done from our unique Amazon partnership. We also see that customers are increasingly interested in multi-cloud.</span></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span><span>Amazon is my primary, but I do have expectations that I use in Azure as well. Azure is my primary. I’m going to use Google as well. When I advocate people that every customer needs to have three clouds working well, you need your private cloud, standardized, operationalized and automated. You pick your preferred cloud partner and then a secondary public cloud partner.</span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span><span>Every customer needs a well-executing three-cloud strategy as you journey into this multi-cloud future. And often, there’s a fourth one, which then is your regional players that you need for certain geographic unique things. If I’m in Germany, maybe it’s T-Systems. If I’m in France, maybe it’s OVH. If I’m in Switzerland, maybe it’s Swisscom. But then now you have a complete cloud strategy, right? And customers are increasingly buying that view the future.</span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span><span>And do you see, I guess, one of the clear benefits of working with Amazon early on was the joint engineering and so forth to build that, and you’ve hooked it now into some of their native services and it’s kind of gone to the next level. Do you think you have the same ability to do that kind of joint engineering and integration into services?</span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span><span>And I guess, the source of the question here is really, from the Microsoft perspective, where they, to some degree, have a story that’s different than yours, but a story that has sort of an on-prem, a cloud, not a multi-cloud story, but it would seem like maybe not as much strategic alignment there. So just trying to understand sort of what you will be able to do with that partnership and how that would compare ultimately to what you’ve – you’re going to do with Amazon?</span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span><span>Yes. We see the Microsoft partnership shaping up in a very positive way. And when I talked to Satya, I said, “Just give it up. VMware won the on-premise thing, quit wasting your resources. You’re not going to succeed anyway." I mean we. your resources, you’re not going to succeed anyway.” I mean, we laugh about it a little bit, but he’s not going to.</span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span><span>Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span><span>…right? Because customers don’t want to go start forking their on-premise data center architecture, just to be able to consume a few Azure services from the cloud, right? Yes, that’s a very expensive proposition, right? And I say, “Satya just run your services on VMware, I’ll help you. Run them on our stack, and then the customer doesn’t fork their infrastructure and they get the value of your services on-premise.”</span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span><span>And I expect customers will drive that in a positive way. We see great engagement from the Microsoft teams to support that model as well, even as they have their own Azure stacks and other things that they’re doing at that level. And I understand it, but I don’t particularly see it as a threat, because I think customers just aren’t going to go down that path.</span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span><span>This idea, though, of working with VMware and being able to say, “Hey, we really are going to follow the lead that we’ve done successfully with Amazon. We’re going to integrate to many of the Azure services, and we’re going to enable you in the private core data centers and build you out to the edge.” I think it’s going to be a pretty winning strategy for them and for us, and we’re clearly investing that partnership with that in mind.</span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p9"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p9"><span> </span><span>Got it. Got it. And then another product-related question in one of your pillars, security. I would say, if you were to challenge me to list the top 10 security vendors, for sure, a year ago, I wouldn’t have put VMware on the list. I think right now, maybe some debate. You’ve acquired some – an interesting asset with Carbon Black. But what separates VMware from sort of being on that, maybe top 10, top five security vendor list? And sort of what resources are you putting behind that positioning?</span></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span><span>Yes. And our strategy, let’s start at the strategy level, because when I laid it out, I said, “I don’t want to become the 5,001st security provider, right? Because literally, it’s 5,000 companies in the security industry, it’s just nuts, right?</span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span><span>Listen, boy, our objective is to radically redefine the security industry by intrinsically building security into the developer platform and into the infrastructure platform to make the attach of the security services operational, efficient, scalable, so that you’re not adding all these point products in. I want to disrupt the security industry.</span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span><span>So that’s the approach that we’ve taken to it. So what are we doing? We acquired a company named Carbon Black and we’re now building it into vSphere, NSX, Workspace ONE. We’re going to make it intrinsically part of those offerings. So that when a customer is running a device and they hit a management and find a security issue, it is seamlessly integrated together, right?</span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span><span>We’re going to use the vSphere footprint and saying, "You’re running vSphere? Oh, let’s start turning on workload protection, just as another click inside of vSphere, right? Those are dramatically differentiated opportunities. And, of course, we’re going to build a big security business as well over time, but we’re not doing it to just be another vendor in that space. We want to change the industry in a fundamental way.</span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span><span>Customers are, I’ll say, are sick and tired of their security footprint. They feel like they’re condemned to this Hades experience, where they have the next attack, they need to buy the next product, right? They hate spending more on this and becomes operational more difficult, but nobody has the courage to rip out any of those last bandaids as they’re yet fighting the next cyber attack. It really is a very purgatory-like experience that they’re trying to get out of.</span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span><span>So a lot of customer interest in the approach. Big platform vendors will emerge, right? I definitely see that that’s going to be the case. That’s what you see Palo Alto doing, Cisco, Microsoft, VMware. I think the next generation of security goes to the platform players that follow this approach of delivering a complete solution set that solves a broad set of problems for the customer as opposed to these point product solutions.</span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span><span>Now, inside of it, we’re still early. We’re going to be launching a lot of these at VMworld, these integration points of our solutions, but we’re going to be pretty bold here. And if I’m not in your top 10 list of security customers when we talk at the conference next year, Walter, I should probably be fired, right? We are going to be on that list, because we are out to be a game changer in the security industry.</span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span><span>Got it. And then one question actually came in on the line here, I guess, around subscription. And understanding this is early and you’ve already addressed some of this in terms of guidance you’ve had for the year and so forth.</span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span><span>But I guess, the question is coming through is, what is your tolerance as a management team to really sort of upend the financial model or have a significant impact on the financial model as you go through this some degree of a transition, I – we’ll hear about more in the future. But how – what is just sort of – how do you think about that, that tolerance to do that to get ultimately where it ends up being?</span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p10"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span><span>Yes. We’re definitely going to lean harder into it. Now at our scale, $11 billion in revenue and $3-plus billion and free cash flow, et cetera, you don’t just get to pick one versus the other, right? You can’t ignore the financial metrics.</span></p>
<p class="p p10"><span> </span><span>But relatively speaking, we’re going to be leaning on the subscription and SaaS growth rate a lot harder as we come into the year. We will – from a product perspective, we’re leaning there harder, and we’re going to make some of the financial trade-offs that may depress some of the operating revenue and EBIT, right, in favor of accelerating the subscription and SaaS growth rate, I mean, the SaaS smile as it’s called, right?</span></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span><span>And as we’re building it up, hey, it’s a couple of three-year cycle until you come to the other side of the SaaS smile at scale, and it’s very profitable and it accelerates your growth stream. But as you go into it, it depresses it, because you’re trading off a perpetual, where you see much more revenue upfront versus over the life cycle.</span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span><span>But we will unquestionably be leaning harder that way. And obviously, as we give our guidance for next year, we’ll be much more explicit on some of those trade-offs, but you will see us lean harder on that aspect of our business.</span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span><span>Got it. And then a product area we haven’t touched on, and I think we’ve heard a lot about over the last six months in EUC. I think the question I’m now getting is mostly is how do you translate what’s clearly a very short-term – there has been a very short-term focus on this product line, and you’ve been in it for a long time. How do you translate that into a sustained growth rate in that business as higher and just make this a bigger business over time, independent of this quarter, next quarter around just COVID impacts?</span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span><span>One of the things that we’ve been successful in doing is redefining the category, right? And we have successfully moved from a mobile management to a full device management. The next phase of that is something we already touched on Walter, where it’s going to be management and security.</span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span><span>Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span><span>We’re increasingly going to be able to say, “Hey, I can’t do both of these things, then you’re not an interesting member of that category.” So we’re going to be clearly driving that redefinition of management and security. We’re also going to be much more about the full workspace experience going forward, where you’re going to say, if you’re in this, you need to change the way you manage the workforce in an increasingly distributed way. And that’s going to include things like zero trust, right?</span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span><span>You want to move past VPNs and you need to build a new model for how they’re distributed and they’re secured. You need to be integrated with the workspace. The Zooms and the Oktas need to become part of the solution set that you’re integrating to</span><span> </span><span>and have made all of those workflows very easy and putting more and more developer value on top of it, so that you’re able to really enhance the user experience. And we call that the workplace solution of the future.</span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span><span>We’ll have a couple of announcements in this area at VMworld as well. And it’s increasingly becoming cloud-delivered, and we saw really good momentum from the SaaS offerings in Q2, in particular, and our partnerships with Azure in this area are strong, IBM, Amazon, all of those are becoming increasing portions of the way we deliver the solution to customers. And that proved to be very effective through COVID, because bam, and we had customers who had 100 remote users that went to 100,000 remote users…</span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span><span>Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span><span>…wow, those are pretty dramatic infrastructure demands, and we just saw some of those clouds scale. The last thing for this category for us is, most of the transformative projects were put on hold because of COVID. Nobody was changing their vendor in the middle of COVID.</span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span><span>Whatever I got, those VMware, I scaled them. If it was Citrix, I scaled them. We are now going to see us get back to those transformative sales, because customers are now past the triage, they’re past the new normal phase, and they’re looking to, “Okay, I’m gong to have dramatically larger footprints of distributed workforce of the future. What solution do I need for them for the long-term?”</span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span></p>
<p class="p p11"><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p11"><span> </span><span>Got it. Great. Well, I think with that, we’re pretty much at the end of the session here. Pat, I just want to give you the opportunity, if there’s anything you want to do, make sure that you get across that we haven’t had a chance to explore in Q&amp;A?</span></p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p12"><span> </span><strong><span>Patrick Gelsinger</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p12"><span> </span><span>Well, as always, Walter, super appreciate you. You’ve been a good partner for a number of years. So thank you and the team at Citi. Maybe the last point would be is VMworld coming up in a couple of weeks. And we’re going to have our first virtual event. We’re expecting well over 100,000 people around the world, around the clock event, a huge number of key announcements, new partnerships that we’re rolling out, key strategies in some of the areas that we’ll be updating on, hundreds of hands-on labs that will be doing a real virtual geek fest at scale and hope that many of you are able to join us there. I’m quite looking forward to it. And as always, great to be able to be with you all.</span></p>
<p class="p p12"><span> </span><strong><span>Walter Pritchard</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="p p12"><span> </span><span>Great. Thanks, again, Pat. I appreciate your time. Thanks, everybody, for joining us, and we’ll see you soon.</span></p>
