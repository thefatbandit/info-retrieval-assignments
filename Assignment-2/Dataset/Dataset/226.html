<p class="p p1"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great, good morning everyone. It's Meyer Shields, KBW’s Equity Research team. And next panel is with AIG CFO, Mark Lyons and Deputy CFO and Treasurer, and I think million other hats, Sabra Purtill. So I want to thank both of you for taking the time to share your insights with us on what I've been describing. And I think this is accurate. It's most interesting in the positive and negative sense. Most interesting time in the insurance industry since I started in the early 90s was just so much going on. And getting your thoughts on that, I think will be tremendously helpful to people. For everyone that that is watching please feel free to submit questions to me.</p>
<p class="p p1">I do have access to those and we want to make sure that we're getting as many investor questions answered as possible during the time that we have with us. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mark for some brief introductory comments. I'll jump in with a few questions of my own. But again, I'll be monitoring that question dashboard the entire time. So please don't hesitate to submit any questions that you have. And with that, Mark, all yours?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Great, Meyer well thanks for inviting us today. And it's great to be here. So we're looking forward to the dialog and the questions and so forth. So I think it goes without saying that 2020 so far this year has been unusual if that's not an understatement. I think one positive thing, though is that the foundational work that AIG has done over the last couple of years is a great positioning.</p>
<p class="p p1">I think a lot of carriers can make a similar claim of being positioned but both on a relative and an absolute sense. I think we're in a much better positioning, especially with this current market environment and the economic environment. So given that as a backdrop, our liquidity position is strong, our capital position is strong. Our commercial lines book, particularly in North America has been largely re-underwritten. It's gotten multiple bites at the apple. Sure, we may get in something like that a little bit more later, a lot there is continuing hardening in the market.</p>
<p class="p p1">And it comes in many forms, price is most obvious, but there's other ways to improve books. And that's continuing. We de-risk the Cat exposure. You've heard Peter Zaffino talk about that quite a bit through underwriting and also increasing our aggregate reinsurance coverage. We created Syndicate 2019 to deal with that spike on the personal line side, on the high net worth. And as a result, the gross and net limit profile is radically different than it was before across many lines, including casualty.</p>
<p class="p p1">We really manage our product offerings and the hedging programs on the Life and Retirement side, mitigating the impact of the low interest rates, the volatile markets and the impact on reserves and capital that's consequent to that. COVID though continues to impact industry results. But there's also been a number of events this quarter. That's really been, I think your earlier point pretty noisy. Certainly a lot of hurricanes, there's been typhoons, we've had the Beirut explosion, not that that's a cat. But that's large unexpected risk event, wildfires that are still ongoing, COVID is still ongoing, civil unrest is still ongoing.</p>
<p class="p p1">Even the Iowa (inaudible) which I have to confess, I had to go back and look at it as to that's not a word I pronounce every day, by the way. So I needed to get up to speed on that. But all of these things aggregate in and low industry freight environments that are making more difficult and make things more price sensitive in a correction type of sets. So but I think it's safe to say with all of that, it's still we're at September 9, so we're the quarters not even over yet. So it's really hard to get a figure for how the quarter would look on cats given that we still have quite a ways to go and cat season, the Atlantic basin doesn't even end until basically Halloween </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">probably appropriately.</p>
<p class="p p2">So but as a result of that though, we want to remind you that on our reinsurance side, in addition to our current covers, we have material aggregate protection as well. And we even bought an additional $500 million of that</p>
<p class="p p2">to help with that regard earlier this year before reinsurance market started to harden. So but I think just broadly, we're confident in the team, we're confident in the business profile that we now have and with the balance sheet, so without taking any more time on overall comments, let me turn it back over to you and let's kick-off with the chat.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay, fantastic. Certainly people want to hear more for you than they do from me. And that's always true. So let me kick-off with one point that you made. Peter spent a lot of time talking about adjusting risk selection and limits management over the past couple of years. And I look at that as A, are the primary focus on the P&amp;C side, I was hoping you could update us on where you’re in that process and how much of that AIG specific effort needs to continue? And how does the fact that we're in a changing pricing environment impact that strategy?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes, I think you're right. I think Peter spent a fair amount of time on the earnings call going into a lot of detail on that because there was a lot of lift that needed to happen. And it was done in a kind of a compounded way.</p>
<p class="p p2">When you talk to some of the underwriting executive management, you find out that you've got multiple bites at the apple. Some are getting to the second bite, some are getting to their third bite at the apple. Some are getting no bites because we identified four risks and got them out. So I'd say the first round, I would just put this in context, I'd say the first round dealt more with limits management in a purported reduction sense, price hardening, and really weeding out underperforming areas and accounts and the second bite probably was a lot more with limit compression in concert with attachments or deductible movement up, not just capacity shrinkage, a lot more T&amp;C being Terms and Conditions being involved and implemented.</p>
<p class="p p2">And for those that are getting a third bite at the apple, you've got not only rate on rate, but rate on rate. And so I think we're in pretty good position. I think we're pretty far along, we're comfortable with the portfolio as a result of all those bites at the apple. And I think one of the last things that we really had to do was the concentration risk associated with PCG high net worth, which we have now had a solution for. So the short answer is we're pretty comfortable with the portfolio as it is.</p>
<p class="p p2">I hope and then the second part of your question was regards with the hardening, that's just allows that to be implemented on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay, thank you. Another strategic question. Earlier in the year, which now seems like centuries ago, there was this comment that we saw a hardening primary insurance market and hardening retro market without much happening in reinsurance. And my sense is that reinsurance is catching up. I was hoping you could comment on one, does that match what you're seeing? And two maybe more broadly, how should investors think about Validus Re in the context of AIG?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Well, first let me just reiterate the first point, which is the rate increases are continuing to occur at an increasing rate. And so on the primary side, that's what we could continue to see and we really haven't seen anything to dissuade that, when we look into early 3Q. With Validus, I think Peter may have commented on this as well. But with Validus, they've also, they grew their volume on non-property spaces last quarter pretty significantly. But they continue to have the de-risk property view that we had across the board.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">So I think they reduce their volatility as a result. And they saw areas of growth. And as the reinsurance market hardens, that Validus is in a position to really capitalize on. If the trade off is correct between risk and exposure, then even the property aspect could probably inch up, but they’re very well positioned to capitalize on every line of business.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Sabra Purtill</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, and just to add on that, Peter had commented on the earnings call that Validus Re net written premiums were up about 39%. And in terms of all lines combined, the rates were up about 16%. So clearly, they’re growing</p>
<p class="p p3">in this market opportunity.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Okay, and it's important for us to understand that again, you've had a lot of success in implementing this volatility reduction structure and the rate environment may actually now allow that to increase prospectively.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Sabra Purtill</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, and that's one of the things that why we pointed to because I think one of the challenges that we have sometimes is when people look at AIG, they look at General Insurance in total. They don't drill down into North American commercial lines or just commercial lines in total versus personal lines. And we got a fair amount of criticism earlier in the year and late last year about how our top line was not growing as much. And as you'll note in commercial lines, and North American commercial lines last quarter net written was up about 7% because with the repricing and the reunderwriting that Mark talked about being significantly through the last couple of</p>
<p class="p p3">years, now we're in a market where we feel comfortable growing and obviously getting rate.</p>
<p class="p p3">So you have to look at it, drilling down into the four different segments we give you because personal lines, on the other hand as you know is a completely different market rate story than commercial lines.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Absolutely. And that's helpful. I do have one question coming in, asking you about your thoughts for growth going forward. You grew during one of the challenging economic periods. So I think that's a positive sign. But is there anything you can share in terms of growth expectations in the back half of 2020 looking forward?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Well, I think in a directional sense, I think it's pretty clear that there's margin expansion and to with Sabra’s comments, which I think is a nice intro into the fact that all rates and margin expansion are not equal, either by line or by geography. So I think it's fair to say that North American commercial in a rank order, North American commercial should see the best gain probably followed by international commercial with personal lines underneath that, for all the reasons we know why we're heavily regulated tougher to get larger increases more muted, where especially with North American commercial, it's not as retail driven, it’s on a wholesale non-admitted business as well. And you've got much more freedom of written form in that environment.</p>
<p class="p p3">So I think there's quite a few areas which we’re in for two reasons pivoting, the book has been repositioned, the market is very supportive and because the book has been repositioned, we’re now less reinsurance dependent than we may have been in the past. Reinsurance was very valuable by all the partners that came on board with us. And you're always going to need that for catastrophe risks and vertical shock and that kind of thing. But I agree with you, the market is hardening on the reinsurance side, and we have Validus to take advantage of that but</p>
<p class="p p3">from a reinsurance purchasing point of view, it's going to be the negotiations that are going to be probably pretty complex. They're in their environment, as you said they lagged on right.</p>
<p class="p p3">And so, but we're in a position now that if reinsurance terms and conditions or pricing we think are too stiff, we're much more comfortable thinking that.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Sabra Purtill</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">I would just add to that, in terms of the book itself, you got to keep in mind the components that drive growth, right, you've got retention on your existing book, which as we’re repricing and re-underwriting obviously, the retention was lower. Peter commented that retention is up like four and five points compared to where it had been a year ago. Secondly, there's new business. And Peter also commented on the call that new business volumes are actually kind of light in the second quarter because of this, just the disruption that we're seeing right sales were low at L&amp;R as well.</p>
<p class="p p4">But now that people have adapted to this new environment, we would hope and expect to see higher volumes of new business as well. And then, of course as we've all been talking about, there's rate. So, from that perspective, we would hope and expect that we're going to continue to maintain strong retention, we will go where rate goes. And as a market leader in many areas, we would hope to see stronger new business.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Excellent, thanks. There was one comment that Mark made on the conference call got a lot of attention. And frankly, I was surprised how surprising it was. And that's with regard to loss trend volatility when we go through I call once in a century event and I was hoping you could flush out what you're seeing with loss trends, and</p>
<p class="p p4">how comfortable you are that even maybe some of the more pessimistic scenarios are reflected in pricing and in reserving?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Okay. Well, I was a little surprised to quite frankly, because I thought some of my statements were pretty consistent with what I've said in the past. I think, so I'm happy to go over and directly answer your question. I think it may have been because it was in the context of margin expansion as opposed to pure loss trend. And I think I made the comment that, Peter talked about a 16% increase globally, and it was 21%, North America, and lesser internationally, and no one thinks there's 21% loss trend. Right, so therefore, there's margin expansion in that sector.</p>
<p class="p p4">So, I think maybe that got some of it, but you do have a lot of other forces, some of which I think are really compounded now by COVID. I mean, you always have the litigation funding aspect, got some runaway verdicts and so forth, but there's still few and far that wasn't a panacea, at that point, but with COVID, you've got now dockets and courtrooms that are really backed up. It's difficult to really get those things through. So in some cases, it's going to be especially on the GL side, GL products side. I think there's the real argument that that's not a claim reduction, it’s a claim deferral. And that will manifest it's just going to be a longer time realization perhaps on some of those.</p>
<p class="p p4">Certain lines like comp, it'll become more self evident. But AIG's comp book is largely three line large deals. So it's large deductible. So it's insurance money more than its AIG's money, right involved with this inside of the deductible. One advantage because you expect to see with people off the streets, that from an auto perspective, it certainly would be a smaller exposure, but AIG has really shrunk its auto book pretty dramatically, and I'm glad to say in the trucking space because with trucking, you pretty much got to take it all in, right. It's you can't cherry pick an exposure here and there you take it all in. So it depends on the size, where a smaller insurance, you got a much different choice on what you're doing. So you've got that. I mean, you've got the upcoming Elections, I mean that always with Supreme Courts and Appellate Courts designees, and so forth. There's always a change. </p>
<p class="p p4">And I would say even the civil unrest aspects could find itself on personal and some commercial lines, creating different exposures and emergences on it. So it's, I think my comment was mostly around the increased volatility of the loss trend, as opposed to the loss trend itself. But for clarity, is there margin expansion in North America commercial? Yes.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay, and I think that's probably the bottom line of what people are looking for. And it sounds like you're comfortable with that on both the rate and the reserve side.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Okay. Another issue that emerged in second quarter was the impact of a much smaller book of travel insurance within North American personal. And I think that was more just the mix of loss and expense as opposed to anything sort of fundamental with profitability or something you can update us on how that market in terms of demand and how the market for event cancellation has been evolving over the course of 2020.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">We ask Sabra to start-off that one.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Sabra Purtill</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure. So to start with travel booking which is in personal lines in both North America and International, although the bulk of its North America, it's about 1.03 billion book. And clearly when COVID emerged and flight restrictions and travel restrictions went into place and people weren't buying plane tickets so they weren't buying the travel insurance. And as we talked about in the first quarter, we had I think it was about $86 million of our loss picks for the first quarter were related to travel.</p>
<p class="p p5">But we have a commission sharing arrangement with that a profit sharing arrangement so that as we people start traveling in and buy tickets, again we'll actually recoup some of that through lower commission rate. But as you pointed out, the travel book is a relatively low loss ratio, high expense ratio book of business. So lacking the premium in that in the second quarter combined with the fact that we obviously still have employees in the travel business first claims and customer service and finance and the rest. It really kind of made the North American personal lines ratios quite strange compared to prior years and then when you added this and to get 2019 on top of it, it was unusual.</p>
<p class="p p5">We continue to be a market leader in that business, and we would expect as 2021 comes along that will be again, people will be buying it. And frankly, I think that type of the product that people buy will be a lot different going forward in part because you've had this experience that we've all gone through, right. And so probably there'll be higher utilization. But by the same token, you do have some airlines for instance, United has permanently waived change and cancellation fees.</p>
<p class="p p5">So I think people might be more likely buying in on, hotels and car rentals and things like that. The other thing I would just note and then on the event cancellation, so the event cancellation book is largely written through Talbot in our international portfolio in its commercial lines. Obviously, Mark can comment on this with his actuarial background that we have taken reserves for those events that we have had known cancellations, there are some events that were postponed, like the Kentucky Derby, which ran this weekend or the Olympics, which are pushed to 2021.</p>
<p class="p p5">So we still have exposure to the extent there's additional cancellations. But as far as a product right now, as you can imagine given the uncertainty, first of all, people just aren't scheduling events. And then secondly, it's kind of hard to price and underwrite in this very unusual environment for the cancellation. But the events cancellation in the travel book, combined with business interruption where we have what I would call affirmative, contagious disease coverage, that's about 70% of the reserves that we've taken for COVID.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">I wouldn't add much more to that. Really, I think it's important to realize that distribution is inventive and innovative. So as airline travel has dropped off, let's say European travel, they've pivoted towards having Western RV Park visits and things like that. So it's not like they're just shifting to a different item. So the indications of course, is that generally there was more travel incrementally, more travel in July, and August. And we're really at the root of the problem itself. So would have been a little uplift on that, but and on event cancellation, you also have non-appearance, so you can have a broader event, or it's not just an event or Rock Group, it could be a series of performance and that could be a non-appearance by one of them where it goes on but it's still impactful. But so you have that coverage. So but that's not similar, right. People don't want to take the risk of going through all that event creation and being on the hook.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Okay, thank you. The next question is both internal and external, and it's with regard to changing work environments, so that has implications, I think both for potential losses, right if people aren't shopping, you don't have to slip and falls, you don't have workers compensation claim frequency. How does a company like AIG anticipate the changing set of exposures in pricing and in underwriting? And then internally, obviously, there's AIG 200 ongoing right now. And I imagine that this has ramifications for that as well. So hoping you could talk about those two sides of this COVID induced phenomenon?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Well, let me just start that, I started with the insurance evaluation on it. Clearly, if there's fewer companies that need insurance that's impactful and the ones that continue to need it if their exposures have dropped, that's impacted meaning negatively impact. But and therefore the exposure base itself may not necessarily be proportional to the risk anymore. I think the classic example let's say pre-COVID is why you can't get quarterly cat covers, right because it would be too concentrated. The cat is over the course of the year, and you just can't buy a 3Q cat cover example. So it's disproportionate.</p>
<p class="p p6">So I think from that respect, you get that kind of that kind of impact. So what do you got to do? You got to be very careful as to what the exposures are, have been divestitures in that the sales and worker's comp of payroll, are they matching up with each other. You could wind up having some of the distribution force trying to help their customers take the low end of the exposures and therefore you're setting yourself up for additional premium on audit, and things of that nature.</p>
<p class="p p6">So you don't want to have a disproportionate amount of your book subject to annualize being audit premium as opposed to the front end. So but overall, it's insurance side, it’s fewer exposure units and perhaps different exposures, lower exposures within those exposure units coupled with the measurement of exposure itself being appropriate on it, so it's really there's certain coverages or certain industries that you can tag hotels for example, and others that you can tag as going to be down for a while. But on the line by line account by account basis, they are the things you have to focus on. Now I don’t know Sabra you have anything to add before we pivot to inside as opposed to the outside.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Sabra Purtill</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">The only thing I would add is just a reminder that obviously within AIGRM, the AIG Risk Management book of business, a lot of that experience change is going to be in the working layer of the policyholder as opposed to the access layers which is where we would attach.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Right, I think we said the average deductible attachment, these are comp GL auto three line deals are, it's averaging north of a million. So you're going to eliminate a lot down there. If it was software market and you had $100,000, $200,000 deductible, it's different story. But this eliminates a lot of frequency and a fair amount of severity at those levels as well. On the inside of this, just take AIG For example, we’re targeting January 1, we're in a lot of countries right and a lot of different offices. So it's not an absolute rule, but it's, so it’s not a bright line. It's a line of demarcation.</p>
<p class="p p6">But with we made that call a while ago, but with all the increasing unknowns, so kids are going back to school. There you see and press all the aggregations of whether it's college or just other events that happen that could possibly reopen things again. So others are doing similar things. So for not reopening their offices, that could also lead your first question about insurable exposures. But it could just change the level of the recovery, putting </p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">on your stress assumptions. But from an AIG 200 perspective, we actually got some benefits because people are traveling, everyone's really available for group meetings. So we're actually getting more done in that respect, as opposed to less than that. Sabra, do you want to add?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Sabra Purtill</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">I would just add, we commented on the second call, I mean the priority of some of the programs and the progress that we've made under AIG 200 is a little different than what we thought it was going to be at the start of the year, but we do remain on track both from expense realization as well as the project perspective and it's a three year program, right. So we've still got some time to go.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Right, but it sounds I don't want to put words in your mouth. But it sounds like you've had the opportunity to move ahead with some of the things because you've had more time to discuss them.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Sabra Purtill</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Yes, an example would be on our commercial underwriting platform because as Mark said, people are available to work on the projects, we aren't traveling, there's we're not doing client entertainment and things like that, that people are available and focused on getting that technology platform pulled together and making very good progress on that faster than we expected.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, we've had a question come in, and I can guarantee it's not the first time that you've heard this question, but it clearly comes up a lot and that is with regard to both the financial and strategic benefits of keeping Life and Property &amp; Casualty under one umbrella instead of having multiple companies, can you give us an update on? Well, I guess does your thinking on that change over time? And how are you thinking about now?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, as Brian said, that's something that is a primary responsibility of a CEO and a senior team with the board. And those things are constantly reviewed, and on the landscape of competing alternatives, avoid things you can do. But let's not forget, we still have although patch rate was 21, right from 35. So truck, the size of it, it's still meaningful, it's about 8.6. I think I caught around between the NOLs and foreign tax credits, that they're still meaningful, as is the capital diversification benefits that you get. And there's other aspects too, but just because they shrunk doesn't mean they're not still material and depending on who wins, you read some of the platforms that rate goes back to 28%, that kind of takes half of that back.</p>
<p class="p p7">So it's a continual topic of course, but I just don't want people to underplay the material impact of the items, I just referenced.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Right, we're discussing it though, if I understand correctly, more on the financial side and strategic side, is that a fair read?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">No, it would be, you got to look at more than one lens on those things. And so multiple lenses would be used.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Okay, I guess the related capital question or maybe I'm trying too hard for natural segway that doesn't exist, but can you give us any thoughts on Capital Management opportunities, whether that's share repurchases, M&amp;A opportunities, or more broadly?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, I think let’s take couple observations first, right. As I start it first, Sabra will also join in on that. So, prior to COVID, we made the comments that that leverage reduction was one of our key or higher level key priorities. And in the face of COVID of what have we done, we initially took a partial drawdown on our revolver in a liquidity and capital risk management framework. We've repaid that fully as we've disclosed and we went to the capital markets as both a better economic time period to do it. But also to get in advance, we could return that revolver money and prefund a fair amount of debt maturities that go through the early part of next year in fact $2.8 billion which go through the early part of next year.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8">So view it as a temporary, meaningful, still unknown COVID risk management approach overall. So the consequence of that is to have your debt and coverage change, but there's going to be natural improvement on that as the maturing securities run through, and that'll take the leverage back to a much more manageable period of time, which would then open the door to other capital management options, though, I think I'm trying to do is similar to your segway is to say, what was the priority and how is that changed? And why did it change, it was for that reason, but it will also naturally reduce over time and then make that not as a key concern because it won't be viewed nearly as a debt leverage outlier.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Sabra Purtill</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Then I would just add to that, because you did ask especially about M&amp;A. Obviously with our stock price trading, where it is the most attractive opportunities we see for capital deployment are first organically within the commercial lines book because of everything we've been talking about in terms of the pricing momentum and</p>
<p class="p p8">expected improvement in the margins and that book of business and then secondly, obviously share purchase. So M&amp;A is not something that's a priority for us at this point in time.</p>
<p class="p p8">I know that there are some transactions out there and notably, like all States transaction, but for us, we're really focused on organic growth opportunities and as Mark mentioned and managing the balance sheet relative to our leverage ratios right now.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay, that's helpful. And yes, certainly there are I mean, I'm sure you're getting no shortage of people encouraging some sort of share repurchase, obviously when your competence in the economic environment allows it. Another obvious use of cash is on the investment portfolio. And here, I mean this is a multifaceted question. How does this strategy evolve when you've got, you've got lower interest rates. You got other opportunities and challenges in the investment arena? How do we take all of that, all of those inputs and understand how the investment approach is staying the same or changing?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Well, I think you saw in the deck that put together for the second quarter and fixed income quarter-over-quarter, roughly a 40 bps drop-off quarter-over-quarter fixed income, which is an automation of things. So you're going to get compression, and that's going to hit NII across the board. That's going to hit L&amp;R, which is spread business, right. So it's clear that there's a lot of places that can hit.</p>
<p class="p p8">On the GI side for example, first off, remember the durations and the volatility are radically different. In rough numbers, you got about a three and a half year duration on the GI side and eight and a half years on the</p>
<p class="p p8">L&amp;R side. But the volatility characteristics are also radically different, right. You can have massive cat costs and other aspects on the property &amp; casualty side and a lot of risk losses where things are more long-term, the variability is not as great on the Life &amp; Retirement side and any given quarter or any given calendar year.</p>
<p class="p p8">So you need longer dated assets. We have other issues because variable annuity guarantees and things like that you have to manage around whereas GI, you have to have that. You're trying to maximize yield, but you can't do it in a silly way, because you've got to have highly liquid assets on the regulatory framework on that. So going into a planning season, it's what is your mix of business? What is the volatility characteristics there for the predictable aspects of those cash flows on both sides of the house going out the door. And given we have $350 billion in investable assets, so it's first you got to think about what’s the scale that we have to buy, you can't go out and try to get 20% of an asset class market as an extreme example, because good luck on something like that.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p9">But you're also doing it with an eye to tax efficiency and capital efficiency. So you're trying to get a good enough spread that you also minimize the capital allocated to the investment functions with diversification credits that you get there. So there's a lot that goes on, but I think it would be naive to say anything but there's increased pressure on as we stay into this continued low rate environment, there's increased pressure. So what's that do on the other end, that's another sustaining clear force towards on the PC side anyway of keeping rates strong, and maintaining that because that's going to be made up somewhere and that's where it has to be better.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Okay, I got a related question to this. And I was hoping you could share with us your thoughts on earnings visibility going forward because we have got industry pressure, we've got potential improvement on underwriting results within P&amp;C. We've got pressure in Life &amp; Retirement, if you cobble all that together for us in terms of earnings visibility?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes, I still think COVID. So far, it's such a screwball that we're not going to really have a lot of visibility, I still feel the same way I did in March on that, I still think there's going to be increased government programs, that's going to possibly change the dynamics and what it supports and what it may not support, firms are keeping assets strong and so forth. And we don't know what the effects that's going to have on liquidity. I think it's going to have to drive taxes up, if we keep doing that would change that. So I think really the straightforward answer to your question is 2021 is going to be where we should have some increased visibility but not the latter half of this year.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Okay, thank you. One of the issues with the third quarter and actuarial assumption review. Can you update us on current long-term interest rate assumptions? And how on the outside, we should think about the updating process?</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Okay. Well, the current 10-year assumption was 3.5%. And that's last year we actually lowered it to 3.5%. I think on those that disclose it was pretty much down the middle. It was some higher, some lower than that. I think a couple of our peers have come out and one lowered it from 3.75% to 3.25% I believe and another ones in the twos.</p>
<p class="p p9">We have a pretty good internal process on it, the process is going to be the same. It's not like we're radically changing the process, that governance is good. There's a robust process around reviews of outside eyes, whether it be DRM or other constituents inside the company and outside the company, taking a look at those assumptions. So I don't have the details for you, that'll be on our call that we'll have it. But I think it's fair to say it'll wind up being at least that plug which is the 10-year that everyone focuses on, which is only a piece of the action right.</p>
<p class="p p9">The spreads are and mean reversion of that, over time of that whatever you target at, what's going to be in five years, 10 years, 15 years and so forth. So I think it's safe to say, it's going to be lower than what we have now.</p>
<p class="p p9"><strong>Sabra Purtill</strong></p>
<p class="p p9">Yes and just to add recall, it's all assumptions right. It's policyholder behavior lapse behavior expenses, and the rest and as you know, a lot of this with LDTI coming along in 2022, 2023 it's all going to change again. So but it is a soup to nuts, kind of evaluation of the performance underlying the contracts, and as you know, our portfolio is mostly annuity base, there is a Life portfolio as well, where we look at mortality assumptions, although we have talked about how although COVID has elevated mortality, it's not significantly different than pricing assumptions with respect to mortality.</p>
<p class="p p9">And then with respect to lapse assumptions, in a low interest rate environment, the performance on fixed annuities and fixed index actually improve which lengthens the duration and like you have a longer recovery period to obviously make the spreads on that. So it is, like I said, not there's an excessive amount of focus on the interest rate assumptions, I think and we'll be talking about all of those when we report third quarter earnings.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Meyer Shields</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">Yes, no, it's certainly very complex. So thank you. So we've got about a minute left and I'm just going to ask</p>
<p class="p p10">both Mark and Sabra for closing comments in terms of maybe what this will be my opinion. I trust you, what the market is missing with regard to AIG and its intrinsic value?</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Mark Lyons</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">That's a great question. That's a great question. I would say that the although I believe it's acknowledged that the general insurance turnaround has been complex, and a steep incline to pull-off, we have pulled that off. And I think more than anything else, the engine inside that has not really been appreciated by the marketplace. Yes, I'll keep it succinct.</p>
<p class="p p10"><strong>Sabra Purtill</strong></p>
<p class="p p10">And I'll say that. I think that and look we understand the Life &amp; Retirement businesses aren't particularly well valued by the market at this point in time. But we do have a very strong balanced conservative portfolio of Life &amp; Retirement products, it is more retirement than it is life. And we have as you know, a very strong group retirement business with VALIC. Diversification among the products, we have no legacy exposure to long-term care, we don't have legacy exposure to what I would call the nuclear arms race variable annuity type products, so we have a very strong stable portfolio that has generated significant income over time and perhaps because people are focused on the GI turnaround and perhaps because we don't do a good enough job explaining that to people.</p>
<p class="p p10">I do think that the valuation that's being put on our Life &amp; Retirement business isn’t reflective of their cash flows or returns.</p>
