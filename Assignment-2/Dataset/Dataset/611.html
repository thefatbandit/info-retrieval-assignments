<p class="p p1"><strong>Q - Ravi Shanker</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">With that Kevin, thanks so much for joining us. Looks nice outside and kind of almost seems like everything is normal again. So, maybe if we can kickoff with kind of your views on how you see the world right now. Obviously, it’s been a tale of I’d say two-thirds, if you will, the way you divide the OR. Does it feel like things are coming back to normal? And I think that, that ramp has some visibility to it finally?</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Yes, no, first of all, thank you for having me. Obviously, first time doing the Laguna conference, I have been there on the other side. So, it’s unfortunately, my first time is going to be virtual but got some pretty good weather out here as you mentioned. In terms of the trends, as we all saw in the second quarter, we saw significant decline in our business, where we peaked in June – May and June, we are down, 26% followed by a fairly rapid recovery, some volatility that we have probably never seen from a volume perspective operationally, did a great job, had some bumps along the road trying to get some people back when the volume came back quickly in July, but we are mainly through that and seeing some good performance out there. Jamie has gone back out in the network really still finding some opportunities. He is out there today. I am actually ahead of this hurricane. So we will be watching that closely as that kind of flows through our network and watching that, but where we see volumes today and this is you see it on our weekly carloads, as we have seen intermodal really start to strengthen here. You follow the truck market, Ravi and that’s really gotten tight here and we will probably get into that a little bit more. Month-to-date double-digit year-over-year increases in our intermodal business. On the merchandise sides, we continue to see a little bit of recovery off the bottom, down at low single-digit mid single-digit range month-to-date. So we are seeing some strength there. It’s pretty obvious that there is low inventories out there across the consumer products. My son can’t get a bike still. So, he is having to ride his sister’s bike right now. There is a lot of products out there, lumber, other things are still having to get restocked. So we are seeing a little bit of that. I think the big question for me and for us as we are looking into, no later in the fourth quarter into next year is, once the restocking is done, are we going to see some continued recovery in the economy and which will carry us through into 2021. So, that’s somewhat of an unknown. I think we are more encouraged that some of this restocking has legs hopefully into the next year. And that will continue to carry us and so we will see how it goes. Coal obviously remains a challenge. We will start to lap that later next year, probably the first time that I am somewhat optimistic on what coal could look like year-over-year as we move into 2021. Just given the comps, right, we are down so much. We have seen such a material impact globally to demand given the pandemic implications. India is a big export market for us, obviously, been very, very impacted. So, we think there is an opportunity that we could be at the bottom. We will see where the commodity prices go. That’s obviously influential for our export business. And then on the domestic side, we saw some pretty low natural gas prices earlier this year and hopefully we are not going to go lower than that. And hopefully, there is a little bit upside there. So we are watching that closely, but there is an opportunity, there is probably as much opportunity into next year as there is risk from these levels that we have seen in a long time.</p>

<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Ravi Shanker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Got it. Adam [ph] Wallace has always been a glass half full guy. So, let’s hope he is right about that coal.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">I don’t know about that. I think he has been pretty balanced around here. He is all about setting expectations internally too.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Ravi Shanker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">That’s fair. So maybe follow-up on your comment on the inventory side, obviously, it’s no surprise that intermodal is coming back first, because the consumer kind of has been strong on the industrial side of things. Do you sense from your customers kind of where they are in terms of that inventory rebuild, kind of what innings they are in both on the consumer side as well as on the kind of merchandise industrial side, kind of maybe kind of what innings are we in, in terms of this recovery and kind of what does that slope look like? Is it a case of, we have this – we have the slow recovery off the bottom and suddenly the carbon flex higher or do you think it just continues the current path?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes. I think we are living in the world of antidotes right now, but we are talking closely with our customers. A lot of – there is still a lot of uncertainty. I mean, we have the election coming up. What does that mean? Post-election how spend levels really look like, but thinking before all this happened, we were having real discussions with customers around – concerns around driver supply, those issues that were really front of mind and I think you are really seeing with a lot of trends, you have seen those really accelerate here in this period. And I think the driver shortage trend. You have probably seen with the pandemic that, that really accelerate that dynamic that we had a lot of customers concerned about. That’s why they were talking about more rail service, quite frankly, with us, ones that we hadn’t – we hadn’t been customers historically so seeing some of those trends play out here, I was just on the call with the Atlanta Fed the other day and we had some trucking companies on there and they are basically saying despite bonuses, raising wages, there seems – they are continuing to see supply come out of the market. So, I think that’s encouraging for us. I think people are going to continue to see the opportunity that rail provides, Jamie and what they have done on the intermodal side, we have a completely different network in terms of how we serve the customer. Transit times are a lot faster, reliability is up. We have a channel partner, one of our major channel partner is out there and continues to say that our service is truck-like, that’s important, that helps us. That helps us win new business. So, I think we are at the really early stages of that trend. And if anything, the pandemic has really I think accelerated those conversations or will accelerate those conversations given some of the shortages we have seen from a trend where we are today, you follow the truck market as close as I do. It’s really tight. And what we really would like is that to continue in the fourth quarter and first quarter, I think that will help bidding seasons heavy in those first couple of quarters, that will help it with our discussions with the customer. When you look at our business, we started the industrial recession in the beginning of 2019. So, we are almost 2 years into this kind of declining environment. So, there is a lot of opportunity, if things start to normalize that the economy comes back for us to continue to win share. I am sure we will get in the – what our opportunities are from a market share perspective little bit later, but we are pretty optimistic on all things that we have done that we were setup well to really capitalize here.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong><span class="question">Ravi Shanker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Got it. I just follow-up on that on the truck point, intermodal point, I mean, there is no question that a tighter truck market is going to be a tailwind for you kind of just given your overlap in that business. What is your go-to-market strategy there? Are you like – is your message to customers will take as much trucking version as you can give us because kind of volume is our front at this point given where you are in your PSR strategy or are you looking to kind of maximize price and kind of maybe try and focus on that or focus on that OR, focus on recurrence rather than go after as much volume as possible?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">No, I think, when we discuss our strategy internally, I think a balanced strategy of both price and volume is a sustainable long-term successful strategy. And that’s what we are looking to do. Our service is much, much better than it ever has been. So, we expect to get price in that environment and particularly in this environment as things tighten on the truck side. So, we want to get paid for the service we are providing. We want to grow with our customers and those discussions I think sometimes customers are still surprised that we are so adamant, we want to grow volume. Jamie has created so much capacity in his operating team out there, where we have the ability to grow into it, whether extending our train length, which we have done – we have been very successful as you have seen sequentially here of the second quarter. So, we got plenty of capacity out there and it’s – we know incremental margins are very healthy as we put more volume through our fixed infrastructure. We hit the train starts, all these things are at levels where we have a lot of ability to leverage the network that’s been – that’s out there. We have talked about 20%, 30% capacity on our network out there, so plenty of room to grow, plenty of opportunity for us. We are excited. Hopefully this market continues to turn in the right direction, but we are – I think we are still cautiously optimistic here given all the things we are seeing, certainly feels a lot better than it was in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="question">Ravi Shanker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Got it. Maybe shifting gears, talking about the incremental margin point you guys raised, because you have been – you have seen in the last couple of conference calls that your cost structure can’t be variable on the way down and fixed on the way up, because it kind of work that way, which is a point that I really appreciate. I really get that point. And yet at the same time, if you guys kind of have – and your peers have been pretty good at not bringing back capacity at the same rate that volumes are coming back. So, how do we think about that incremental margin range in the back half of 2020 and for the next couple of years? I think in the past, you guys kind of from a sustained basis have done high 60s, 70s even kind of are we looking at that level of incremental margins? Do we do better, do we do worse given that you already have such strong starting point from the OR side and how you think about that before?</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Yes, I am not going to break any news today and provide guidance on incremental margins. What I said on the second quarter call is as we improve sequentially hopefully off the bottom, I expect very, very strong incremental margins better than what we are obviously doing in the second quarter and that’s – that will hopefully be reflected in the overall OR margins that we will start to see in the third and fourth quarter. So, I am – everything that I have seen quarter-to-date is playing out that way. When you think about our fixed cost structure, depreciation, G&amp;A which we continue to drive even more efficiencies there, seeing a lot of opportunities there, there is a lot of things that we took the opportunity to look at in the second quarter. I think at one point, we had a list of 50 different initiatives that we were evaluating, not all of those are things that we are going to be able to drive this year. They might have 2, 3 year, but we really tried to accelerate those items, whether it’s looking at our vehicle spend, maintenance, our leases looking at whether we need to be in some buildings getting out of those. I mean, the list goes on and on, our data center, on the technology side, how can we be more efficient? Technology is a huge, huge spend for us. On the engineering side, Ricky and his team under Jamie done a fantastic job and that’s not only on the OE side, it’s on the capital side too. And I think that gets a little bit lost. When you talk about the railroads, we have a huge capital spend every year and as we can get more and more efficient there, that’s a lot more dollars either that we return to shareholders or we use to accelerate some of our investments, whether it’s an automation, a huge – we kicked off a huge exercise on the automation side, they evaluate every opportunity we have out there and kind of prioritize it like we never have done before. We are still going through that process, but we talk about automated trains all the time. There is so many other things from an inspection perspective, even on the G&amp;A side, that you can get in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the long-term that are opportunities for us to drive cost out of here, including how we put capital in the ground out there, using data analytics to analyze where we should replace track and do that in a much more data-driven way. I think there is huge, huge savings opportunities using automated equipment to take labor out of the process and probably do the functions a lot more reliably. It’s a huge opportunity. So, a lot of those things, we took a step back as a team and so let’s really accelerate some of these things, let’s look at it. Let’s all have a buy-in from a leadership team of what we want to prioritize. Quite frankly, we didn’t always prioritize the things that we didn’t look at returns and what prioritized the things that have the highest returns and let’s drive those here in the near-term. So, I am really, really excited about all the work we have done there. We don’t have all the answers today, but we have a lot of drive and we have a lot of momentum here internally to kind of look at that.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="question">Ravi Shanker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Got it. Can I just follow-up on that? I think that’s a very important point and I think it’s kind of an overlooked part of the CSX story and everyone thinks about – when we think of CSX, you think of OR, you think about strong operations. I don’t think you think about technology and automation just yet. So, you said hundreds of millions of dollars of opportunity over what period of time are we looking at here, when does this kick off, is this something that we can realistically see in the next 2 to 3 years? We are planning to have an analyst day where you kind of open to come on a little bit on the tech and investment side? And how do we think about that as an incremental cost opportunity for you guys, now that you have already taken out a lot of the kind of low hanging fruit and you are already kind of in the mid or high 50s and stable basis?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes, I think we probably have not done a real good job of communicating externally on all the things we are doing on the automation technology side. There, we have a significant spend, even in 2020 on a lot of initiatives that we are driving today that are, when you look at our dispatching system, the past planner, when you look at our fuel efficiency, technologies that we are still investing in, they are kind of across the board and when I talk about hundreds of millions, that’s over, a number of years and what we are trying to do is layer these things in because the end state goal might take five years But there’s, there’s steps along the way where we can realize a lot of savings. in our dispatching system, how are we going to layer that and it’s a four or five year process, but there is savings along the way, as we turn things on, that we can realize in the near term. So what I would like to build, and I think what the team is building up to is building a cadence every year where we see savings dropping through from these initiatives. And, I think it’s also important, as we look back at what we have been, where we have been successful, where we haven’t been successful is to make sure the whole company has support around these things. And so we continue to invest in them over five years, we have had a lot of starts and stops. When I have looked over the last ten years we are, we have had an initiative had a lot of support, and for one reason or another that dropped off, because the dollars were reallocated somewhere else. So it’s important for us as a team to all agree that these are our priorities and we are in the process of doing that and we also have to decide, as a technology there today or do we think is going to be better in three years, and maybe it makes sense to reevaluate in three years. But, the inspection side is a huge opportunity and it takes out labor obviously costs longer term, it can make our railroad safer, which is our number one priority. When you look at all of the things, our machine can find things that the human eye cannot, and the pace of the amount of opportunities we have to inspect using, some of these cars and technologies that we which is infinite versus, sending a human out there to, to look at the track every several times a week, so, really, really excited about that and we think about automated terminals. Really we are on the forefront of that but how can machine learning help us sort and plan for our trains in a bit more optimal way. We have introduced some technologies on our crew planning. That is really where as you know, when we fall short it is usual because of the crew shortages that we have. So how can we predictably determine whether we are going to be short crew so we are hiring in the right places and maximizing the vacation planning for those things that happen all the time out there so we are getting a lot better on that using the technologies but we are in the first innings honestly of that process. But the most important stage is getting the buy in from the from the top level down and letting everyone know this is priority for us.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Ravi Shanker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Got it. Speaking of crew shortages, shifting back to the near term here the Surface Transportation Board kind of send a sent a letter to the CEOs of all the class one rails kind of is pointing out that the volumes are coming back. So let’s make sure that service standards stay high. As these volumes come back, obviously, if it wasn’t accommodate you, but maybe kind of, if you can share that on your side of that. Where do you think that came from? And or what are you doing in response? Would that be helpful?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, I think the industry, as I mentioned before, the volatility I saw, from the severe declines, and then, off the bottom in July, it was challenging. It was challenging, for people to get people back to work. Also, furlough, given all the environment out there with the pandemic, I think, I think we all return to work was a little bit slower than what we probably were thinking at the time around July period probably was not helpful. As, people were taking final vacations and the school starting back up all those dynamics, I think caught the whole industry flatfooted a bit, but we caught up really quickly. We have recalled a number of further employees rolling a lot better right now when you look at our trip plan compliance versus what we are doing in the second quarter. So, we are pretty pleased with how we have improved off of that. Are we where we want to be? Absolutely not. Jamie has high expectations. We still have some ways to go. He has aspirational goals there that have a lot of runway for us to improve from there, but I think they realized of the challenges that occurred, some volatility that we have never seen before in our business and I think are hopefully seeing the results now on what we are able to do.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Ravi Shanker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Got it. And just kind of maybe closing the loop here on the OR side, I mean, you guys understandably had a six handle on OR in 2Q just which was a pretty remarkable outcome given how tough things were. I don’t think it’s a huge stretch to say that probably goes back to 5 handle in 3Q. And you have been kind of pretty clear with the incremental margins and kind of bringing back costs lower than volumes on the kind of operation side, but were there any lumpy items on the cost side where you guys kind of did emergency cost cuts or like delayed some cost actions, where you may actually have some tougher sequential cost comps in 3Q versus 2Q?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Yes, there were, I think companies out there elected to have short-term deductions to management pay, those kind of things. We did not elect to do that. We kept our workforce engaged, working on all these structural opportunities that I mentioned that hopefully will carry through in 2021 and ‘22 and beyond that. So, we are pretty proud of that and all the things that we have been working on. There is things I think the one thing that came up on the second quarter call was an employee, comp per employee. With incentive comp obviously, first quarter was a pretty good quarter for us and then second quarter obviously with the pandemic impact saw some adjustments on our incentive comp there. So that’s the only thing that I can think of other than and we carried a little bit extra cost on the pandemic side in the second quarter that we won’t see in the third quarter. But outside of that, there is really nothing nuanced that we would have cost coming back in the third and fourth quarter that we didn’t see in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Ravi Shanker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Got it. So 5 handle on OR is getting ready?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Not guiding today.</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong><span class="question">Ravi Shanker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p5">I thought it. Cheers. Maybe shifting gears a bit and kind of talking about the balance sheet kind of how do you think about the balance sheet in the current environment? Obviously, you have had a couple of kind of Black Swan events in the last few years, whether it’s geopolitics and tariffs or obviously the pandemic. Do you feel like you need to run kind of with more cash in the balance sheet going forward kind of how do you think about long-term CapEx planning and capital projections? Does that change your balance sheet strategies at all?</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, if anything, I think this period of time reflecting back on has probably given me more confidence of the resilience of our model. Our conversations with the credit rating agencies prior to this, was we would like to see how your business performs in a downturn now. Well, guess what, in the second quarter, we are obviously generating a lot of free cash flow despite all the challenges in the third quarter, we are going to continue to do that through the fourth quarter. So, I am looking forward to having those conversations with them and showing them the resiliency of our business model. It’s quite impressive and I think it’s a step function change from what we were able to do previously. Do I need to hold a little more cash on my balance sheet longer term? I don’t think so. I think I said on the second quarter call something probably a little south of $1 billion I am comfortable with probably more comfortable with now than I was before. We have got a significant amount of cash on our balance sheet. I don’t expect that to continue in the medium long-term. We will look for ways to deploy that cash when it makes sense. Are we being on the conservative side right now? Absolutely. My first priority, in my seat right now is to manage risk. And so that’s been my number one priority. I think we have done it very, very well. We haven’t had to slash our CapEx spend. We are at the bottom end of our original range. We are investing more capital in the railroad than we have in any other year and we are pretty proud of that. We are doing it more efficiently than we ever have and we are using those efficiency dollars that even do more within the yards, so really accelerating that spend and that work here this year given the lower volume. So, taking advantage of all of those things, given the environment that’s played out here. So, I am pretty excited. I think, from a CapEx spend levels going forward, I still think there is a lot of inefficiencies when I think about my core infrastructure spend. And I talked about introducing technologies, how to drive it, but also just, Ricky has done a – Ricky and his team and along with Jamie have done a phenomenal job this year when you look at our productivity, labor productivity up double-digits year-over-year on our capital side. So I think there is still some opportunity there. We will look at – we have a completely different process in terms of how we evaluate CapEx spend, creating a lot more accountability than we ever had before. And so looking at trying to learn from things that we have done well and things that we are not doing so well and improve on those, which is a very, very different approach than what we have taken before.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="question">Ravi Shanker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Got it. We have a few minutes left. So I want to remind the audience to submit their questions and via the webcast. We do have a few questions that come in. I will toss one over to you, Kevin, how does pricing look like in 3Q, are there similar mix and pricing headwinds to what you had in 2Q?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes, I think we have a question that came up on the second quarter call is this RPU pressure we have seen in our business given the mix issues and how that will play out for the remainder of the year. We are looking at something probably similar to what we saw in the second quarter that 7% to 8% RPU decline on a year-over-year basis, just particularly driven by intermodal is now up, we are seeing up volumes in intermodal. And when you look at the coal business, still seeing large double-digit declines and coal on a RPU basis is 3 to 1, little over 3 to 1 versus intermodal. And so, that’s a huge driver for us. We think that will probably persist into the back half of the year and then we will start to lap that going into next year. It all depends on where the business is coming from. But again, we are pretty pleased on where we are seeing some wins on the merchandise side. They are just starting to show up in our volumes. We think as I mentioned before, our sustainable growth strategy is both volume and price. And we are coming into the fourth quarter and the first quarter where it’s a heavy, the re-bidding cycle is coming up. And so if we see a healthy market on the truck side, I think that will help with our customer discussions there. Pricing as you know, doesn’t – versus the truck doesn’t move month-to-month. You have to – as contracts come up for re-bid we will look at those and we have got a great service right now. So, I think those conversations get a little bit easier as we go into next year hopefully.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Ravi Shanker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Got it. Understood. So maybe kind of following up on that kind of where would you characterize the kind of bulk of the pricing pressure in the industry, if you will, is it intra-rail competition, is it rail versus truck obviously, if it’s versus truck that’s going to ease in the next 6 to 12 months given what’s happening in the trucking side? So do you expect a meaningfully higher price environment in the 12 months?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Meaningfully, these things, when the markets weaken, we don’t tend to see those dramatic declines and when the market strengthens very quickly, we don’t see the dramatic increases. And that’s kind of the understanding we have with our customers that we are not going to have this volatility month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. Do I think if the current environment holds the discussions will be more positive as we go into next year, then maybe fourth quarter last year, when we are in the middle of the industrial recession and things were challenged for our customers. I do. I do think those discussions get a little bit easier to have, but we don’t see these wild swings in our business and we want to have those discussions with our customers. How can you give us more wallet share? How can we work with you to grow your business, get more volume on to the railroads, it makes all the sense in the world from an environmental standpoint? How can we work together to drive those? I mean, the team, what their resources they have now and all the changes we have been able to make and are really seeing some new opportunities there. So, we want to work with the customer, it’s important for them to be successful as much as for us. So, I am pretty excited. We need this in market environment to hold up and volume to continue to improve.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="question">Ravi Shanker</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Got it. And with a couple of philosophical questions or theoretical questions, if you will, one from me, one from the audience. The one for me is kind of you kind of highlighted the mix difference being called intermodal before which I think people know pretty well. There is a number of reasons why that’s the case. And one of that is because obviously closing of unit train and intermodal is going to manifest rate and so it’s a little more complex to build yet kind of there is this movement in the rail space kind of go towards, multi-commodity, really complex, very long manifest trains the way to improve OR, there seems to be a little bit of a dichotomy there, because what used to be historically kind of a negative mix is now being viewed as presented as a tailwind war. How do you square that? I mean, can you make a train that has every commodity on it that’s super long, that can be as profitable as a go-train?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, I think the proof is in our trip plan compliance, right, what is the customer experience in all of this and those are better than they ever have been, when you look at what we are able to do prior to 2017 why we didn’t measure it, it was pretty obvious to us that had we measured it, they would be well below what we are able to do today. So, from a customer experience perspective, it’s never been better that we have – we had had some issues obviously coming out of this sharp increase, but we are going to continue to drive that into the high 90s on the intermodal side and that provides a lot of opportunity to compete with truck. So, we are pretty optimistic there on the merchandise side really, they want to know that their freight when we tell them is going to get there is going to get there and we are now showing it to them, they can get on and log in on the ship CSX and they can see it real time. And they, I think customer transparency is very, very important, holds us accountable. It’s been very good. They know, they can look at it and say where they are having issues or not and we can talk about it. So, I think that’s helping the discussion a lot as well. We put trip plan compliance in place for a reason to hold us accountable to the customer. I think the customer appreciates that. So, it’s working – are we finding efficiencies by combining trains, it also takes volume – takes some trains off the network and makes us run a little bit quicker and that’s been helpful as well, decongesting the network, allowing us to grow into it, not having issues out there. So I don’t think we have had to make a trade-off as we have – as Jamie has kind of redesigned a network and worked with his team to do that.</p>

<p class="p p8">Got it. And just last one on the M&amp;A side, I think most investors kind of have put aside possibility of Class 1 M&amp;A for kind of all these reasons and you guys have made it clear that’s probably not going to happen for a long-time. But obviously, if we are – we have seen recent transactions, that recent speculation of private equity come into the space. Do you think that changed the dynamic at all in terms of either M&amp;A or competitive risk if you are dealing with a private entity controlled by private equity, rather than a public railroad? And how do you think that changed industry?</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Boone</span></strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Yes, I won’t comment too much on KCS. But if it’s a private equity coming in, I don’t see a whole lot of changes for us. We still interchange a lot of business. I don’t see why that would change given the ownership change there. If it happened, we are looking at we have – we generated a lot of free cash flow and we have a lot of cash on the balance sheet today. If there are ways that we can continue to invest to drive core growth on to the railroad, we will look at those things. Are they large opportunities today? Probably not, but we will look at everything. We can – others have been successful of strengthening the core franchise. We will look at ways to do that as well. It’s all about driving more volume to the railroad. I mean, are there transloading other opportunities out there to do that that will open up new markets for us? I think there are. These aren’t necessarily huge investments and certainly things that can be funded through our free cash flow and the cash we have on our balance sheet today. As I get more efficient on our – on the capital spend, we can allocate more dollars towards those things as well, which is pretty exciting.</p>
