Thank you.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Good afternoon. My name is Nick Abbott. I am one of the analysts here at Wells Fargo CIB. And it's my pleasure to introduce our next company, Arena Pharmaceuticals and with that CEO, Amit Munshi. So welcome, Amit. Maybe as an introduction, you could provide a brief overview of the folio of pipeline programs and also over the last four years, the initiatives you have taken leading to the decisions to partner ralinepag, spin out discovery research into Beacon and then most recent formation of Arena Neuroscience.</p>
<p class="p p1"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p1">Sure. Thanks Nick. And thanks again for the Wells team for having us here. The last four years have been characterized by really a very incremental, steady growth program for the company. As some of you know, we split the company down to being about 35 people back in 2016. We were around $300 million market cap. And we were really just trying to put one foot in front of the other. And that's sort of been thematically how we built the company.</p>
<p class="p p1">Early on, we couldn't sustain a discovery research platform. So we spun of Beacon into a separate company with their own separate P&amp;L and asked them to be a standalone business, which they have accomplished. Again, just trying to optimize resources and be mindful of every dollar we spend and where it goes, recognizing fully well that we are stewards of our stockholders' capital.</p>
<p class="p p1">So the second step of the equation was, we really want to get the multiple Phase 2 data readouts moving forward. We knew we had lots of things on the shelf. We had a budding cardiovascular business which we weren't talking about back then. We knew we had these neuroscience assets but again we weren't talking about back then. We turn over the first two data cards, ralinepag and etrasimod. Both of those programs as normal look good and look robust. The competitive profiles looked fantastic and we weren't moving to Phase 3 and we found ourselves in a unique situation where we just simply couldn't execute that broadly.</p>
<p class="p p1">And so we took the next incremental step, which was to partner out ralinepag to United Therapeutics, who are arguably in the best possible position to be able to bring that product to patients. So we were excited about that deal. That deal brought in additional $800 million of capital and have allowed us really build that next leg of the story. So again, everything has been sort of stepwise and incremental. It's easy to look back and go wow, what a great ride. And it has been a great ride. Really, we take things in tiny little chunks because you can do anything but you can't do everything. And you definitely can't eat an entire elephants all at once.</p>
<p class="p p1">So as we build this company over the next decade and we really think we have got the bones here to build a company that could get to a $10 billion or $20 billion type enterprise and we have got the capital structure, we have got strong investor support for which we are incredibly grateful. We have got a fantastic and robust portfolio. And of course, we have got a management team that we demonstrated over and over that we can execute. So we got the right ingredients. But it's still a matter of just taking things step-by-step.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p2">And the neuroscience is a great example of what we think is good and prudent decision making. We could have build it in-house. That would have taken on a whole another set of burn and obligations and management bandwidth and distraction from what we think are some of the core value drivers over the next 24 months for the business. We could have just scattered the assets and sold them off. We thought that was not shareholder maximizing. And so we chose to actually spin out Arena Neuroscience. So the assets have moved over. They are in the process of raising private capital. And then eventually we will take that company public, we hope.</p>
<p class="p p2">So a long road ahead there for those assets, but great progress to-date. And again, just part of that prudent decision making as we go over time. And I know there is a different group of investors on this call and across the U.S. and Europe. Some have two to three year time horizon. Some have three to five time horizon. Some have a one year horizon or even shorter. And we recognize and appreciate that we need to balance all these varied shareholder interests over time.</p>
<p class="p p2">But as a management team, we can only build for the long term. We can only build a company in small pieces, but for the long term. That's how our approach. Looking forward to the next 18 to 24 months, we have a whole slew of important data readouts. I am reticent to call them catalysts because that implies we are kind of lurching from one catalyst to the other and that's clearly not how we think about it. We have got important data readouts which help us make the next set of decisions.</p>
<p class="p p2">And the first one, of course, is atopic derma coming up later this year. We have also got the start of the UC 12 study, which will be a clear indication that UC 52 is on track. So those are kind of two critical pieces later this year. We are hoping to do a cardiovascular data later this year where we are going to be talking about our second clinical stage cardiovascular asset. So kind of building out that next leg of the stool over time.</p>
<p class="p p2">As we turn the corner into the new year, we will be looking at the olorinab Phase 2b data in IBS C and D. Hopefully, COVID dependent, looking at some Crohn's data throughout the course of next year. And then the UC data at the end of next year. So again, a very busy even just the next 18 months for us as a business. And in there, we will have the alopecia areata data. Following from there, we will have the eosinophilic esophagitis data.</p>
<p class="p p2">So that's quite a bit of key milestones for our business and each milestone is going to come with its own set of decisions. And for example, if atopic derma is successful, do we look at other eosinophilic conditions, eosinophilic gastritis or eosinophilic rhinitis, which fits nicely with our franchise strategy. But opens up even broader extensive questions like, is eosinophilic asthma and scope. So those are questions we will answered in a step-by-step action</p>
<p class="p p2">So that's how we kind of handled the last four years and that's how we are going to think about our decision-making going forward.</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Okay. That's a great overview. I think we can finish and now. I have got to get a coffee. But the corticosteroids obviously is etrasimod which has a potential as a best-in-class S1P modulator, perhaps not the first compound to make that claim. But plenty of the clinical data you have shown suggest it has a less first dose heart rate effect, has a faster onset, got a faster offset than some of the approved S1P1. So could you talk about mechanistically why this is a differentiated compound?</p>
<p class="p p2"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p2">Yes, absolutely. So I would be a little bit bolder here and I would say, instead of getting the best-in-class or best in S1P, I think we have a chance to create something very unique across a broad range of autoimmune indications with an once-a-day oral agent that has the opportunity to be the preferred once-a-day oral agent. So it starts with the class not having any of the baggage of the JAK/STAT pathway and we all know it's a highly conserved pathway.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p3">You see this STAT pathway going back to yeast cells. So it's ubiquitous across the body. It's highly conserved. So every time you are diminishing the JAK/STAT pathway, you are hitting any part of it, you are really having multiorgan type activity. And we see this in their clinical data, we see it in their safety profile. So the S1P class is substantially different to JAK and it really gives us a leg up right off the bat. Within the S1P class, the way we think about it is, is really about pedigree and legacy.</p>
<p class="p p3">As we know the first generation S1P modulators were all born out of an ancient Chinese and Japanese medicine. And [indiscernible] came out of that group. That same group developed amiselimod and other agents. They are structurally similar. They have extremely long half-life. There is a ton of off-target activity. And then you have got the serendipity compounds and the serendipity compounds include ozanimod, which was a tool compound at Scripps. Did not go through a formal medicinal chemistry program at an industrial scale in the way we think about it.</p>
<p class="p p3">And then you have got the S1P modulation programs at Arena, which really were the beneficiaries of several hundred million dollars of investment over a good course of a decade. So again, we don't just have etrasimod. We have a library of these compounds and an exquisite understanding of the role of S1P modulation in the body, its intrinsic role as it relates to the GIRK channel in the heart, for example, it's structural activity relationship, it is receptor pharmacology and the list keeps going on and on.</p>
<p class="p p3">And the more we understand because this is a homegrown and the more we understand, the more we can do things like that etrasimod CR, extend and expand the intellectual property. So etrasimod is more of a completely different pedigree than the rest of the compounds in the category. And as a consequence, as you mentioned, it has the fastest arm rate, has no titration schedule, has the lowest intrinsic cardiac conduction abnormalities with no titration. It has a very fast offset and the offset is absolutely critical with a very short half-life.</p>
<p class="p p3">Even ozanimod where this metabolizes at 10 to 13 day half-life. So you start stacking through all of the benefits. Then you move into the receptor pharmacology, the on-target activity on S1P 1, 4 and 5 and avoiding the 2 and 3. We know unequivocally that ozanimod hits us when P2, as an example, we know S1P 2 opens cell to cell junction protein. So it works against itself. You don't want open cell to cell junction proteins.</p>
<p class="p p3">In all of these diseases, a broad range of these diseases which are essentially barrier dysfunction diseases, so it's barrier dysfunction in the atopic derma and barrier dysfunction in ulcerative colitis, it's barrier dysfunction in Crohn's. So the underlying fundamental of the pharmacology, the pharmacokinetics lend themselves to really, what we think is a product that could potentially change the landscape of a lot of autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">And again the safety profile in fact of many of the diseases, if not all the diseases, they are evaluating of the pediatric patients, is there an opportunity to not bolt-on pediatric patients, which is what companies normally do, but trial accelerates best in the pediatric settings.</p>
<p class="p p3"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p3">Absolutely. So we want to get to through atopic derm study. We are taking that study down to 16 and over. And we will have adolescent data on a number of patients that will open the door to being able to study the drug in multiple pediatric populations. So that's planning, next step that's ongoing. I think it's also important to remind our investors that and the pediatric is a perfect segue to this, which is a we talk about the studies that everyone is waiting for, the Phase 2b and Phase 3.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p4">For Phase 3 program or every Phase 2b program, there is half a dozen other studies we have to get done, drug-drug interaction study which are different by disease-by-disease, exploration of different drugs. In derm studies, you have to do light sensitivity study. So there is a whole range of other studies that have to get done that are supporting and the more of those that get done, the easier it is to move forward in the pediatric indications. So it's the totality of the package that we are always thinking about.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">You mentioned initiation of Elevate UC 12 as sort of validating that the 52 week study is going well. So can you just [indiscernible] have you, what you have done in the ELEVATE program to closely match the Phase 2 and limit the chance of something unexpected happening that derails the Phase 3?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">You mean like COVID?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. Well, not like COVID, but just sometimes patients staying at wrong change, you go from local data to essentially review data, that just with your attention to detail, just sort of what do you do to ensure ELEVATE has the highest chance of success?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Yes. I think your point is spot on, which is matching the Phase 2 population to the best of our ability is absolutely actually critical. And we have done that for Phase 3. The Phase 3 inclusion looks like the Phase 2 inclusion. There is really not much of a difference, with the exception that we have to allow some [indiscernible] in that failures in the Phase 3. And we don't anticipate more than a handful of those. And we have accounted for that in our statistical analysis and our sample size calculation that we show overpower. I am incredibly proud of the team on ELEVATE 52.</p>
<p class="p p4">We have maintained momentum. We were ahead of schedule before COVID. We were able to absorb a short term delay. We didn't close down the trial. We worked closely with the sites and countries and the health authorities around the world. We are up and running close to 400 sites in 40 countries. We have maintained momentum and really pleased that we remain on track. So at least for me internally, I think that is just a massive win for our business and I guess I am incredibly proud of the team for the work they have done.</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">Right. So we have to see data on ELEVATE end of next year, I believe. And then so just wrapping up on the GI franchise, you have programs in Crohn's disease and now EOE. So just very quickly, what are the timelines, what are the data is expect to readout in Crohn's. and the EOE over the next 18 months or so?</p>
<p class="p p4"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p4">So the Crohn's is all dependent on guidance on timing, simply because initiating large-scale trials in a Phase 2b program in this environment is incredibly difficult. We are working incredibly hard to try to make the most important decision we need to make in</p>
<p class="p p4">Crohn's is the dose finding. We are taking two doses forward, two and three milligrams and we are trying to figure out the best way to be able to make that dose findings as of next year to keep the program as close to on track as possible. So stay tuned. We are going to provide more detail probably as we get through the back end of this year.</p>
<p class="p p4">On EOE, we haven't initiated the trial yet. And again, you will know when we do. Like Crohn's, initiating new trials in this environment is extremely difficult. We really pulled out something quite amazing in getting the alopecia areata study up and running. It was a smaller study, fewer sites. So it made it a little bit easy. EOE studies are larger studies, more sites. Crohn's is even larger, even more site. So the larger, the more complex the study, the more difficult it is to get up and running. But we are still hopeful to start EOE this year and we are still hopeful we will get some Crohn's data.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">So you mentioned alopecia areata. That takes us to the derm franchise where to say that the AD data is one of the most highly anticipated biotech events. So is the end of the year is probably would be an understatement. But I know you don't want to go out on a limb and say, what really is a home run. You mentioned there is safety issues with the JAK inhibitor class but were you to show efficacy in the ballpark of the Phase 3 abrocitinib data from Pfizer with a superior safety profile, that would be home run. But how much of a buffer does improved safety give you in terms of the level of efficacy that you think you need to see in order to be successful in AD?</p>
<p class="p p5"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p5">Sure. So if you look at the JAK data from Phase 2, so putting the Phase 3 data aside, looking just Phase 2 to things you try to compare to the extent possible apples-to-apples here. And again it's not really possible. But to the extent we can, just look at Phase 2, you will see a range of change from EASI from baseline can very well see placebo between the 20s on the low-end and 40s on the high-end. So that's sort of the delta. So we think anywhere in the middle of there with a safe profile, I think is a winning proposition.</p>
<p class="p p5">And you don't really have to look very far to see what wins in dermatology. Psoriasis is the best example we have where you have got biologics, but incredibly high efficacy bars and yet 40% to 50% of all the patients are [indiscernible] as well, with about half of the efficacy. Why? It's an oral. So again, oral agents are preferred over biologics, safer programs. So not a safe program. And the JAK neighbors, like I said, you can try to fine tune and dial in all the sensitivity as best as we have with JAKs, we know most of them at high doses have significant adverse event risk and in some cases have met with regulatory challenges of the high doses.</p>
<p class="p p5">We just saw filgotinib have middling data. Again, they have some issues with the high dose. We think there is just of wide open window here for the profile that etrasimod could potentially have. And all the signals are moving in the right direction for us. Competitive landscape evolution as well as critically the ongoing work we are doing with the program. I would be remiss if I didn't mention etrasimod CR as part of the dermatology program and we are working really hard to dovetail that program into the Phase 3 for atopic derma, assuming atopic derma is successful. And the reason we are doing that is, derms are even more sensitized to safety profile. So we have to hit this big gap that we have from other S1P modulators and this giant gap we have compared to the JAK inhibitors and we want to separate even further.</p>
<p class="p p5">Etrasimod CR has already demonstrated in our initial work, as we mentioned earlier in the year, that we were able to take our non-titrated single-dose heart rate down further by 75%, down to low single digit heart rate changes. And so low single digit heart rate change is really de minimis. It's negligible. It's not something. It's asymptomatic. It's 10 beats or nine beats or eight beats is definitely asymptomatic at two to three beats. So we are taking our best-in-class profile and making it better.</p>
<p class="p p5">And just to remind everybody, non-titrated setting of competitive products averaging 20 and 30 beat heart rate drops. And in a titrated schedule, at day eight, we have still demonstrated 11, 12, 13 beats. So they are seeing double digit heart rate drops at day eight. We are seeing single digit heart rate drops at day one and we are going to take that even further and drop that further. So this is again, these are homegrown products. We understand how these products work, we like to think, better than anybody else. So it gives us a real leg up.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">So Amit, are there any benefits beyond this first-dose heart rate effect of the CR formulation?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">That's the predominant. That's what we were shooting for. So we are trying to keep the CMax down and we are trying to keep the area under the curve the same and that's what we accomplished. So we have used these set of tools before in, for example, ralinepag IR to XR that we were up the bridge sufficiently for the FDA in terms of bridging work, bridging tox, bridging biologics work and we will be doing the same thing here. So we are pedaling fast to try to make sure that we can get the stuff dovetailed.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Because why I ask this is the 10-K lists that early as possible patent expiry for etrasimod is 2029, I believe. So obviously this gives you a chance to extend the IP. But is there concern that somebody can could on the CR and then switch to a generic? Or do you have strategies to further extend the IP of etrasimod?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. So first of all, thank you for reading the 10-K, which I am not sure I can get to through the entire thing. Mind-numbing documents. That's 2029 before patent term extension. So the patent term extensions we have set gets us out well into the mid-2030s. And then the CR gets us even further. So the way we think about CR is extend and expand, right. So extending the intellectual property, expand the broader universe of indications and bridge as quickly as possible. Those are the three key ways of thinking about this.</p>
<p class="p p6">And well, well before the generics show up, we will have converted the entire market to the CR formulation. So we are not concerned about that. In fact, going back to the atopic derma discussion, if atopic derma is successful, then a broad range of other indications that could potentially happen. This gives us a leg up for that.</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Right. Well, let's switch gears to olorinab. The study that you did in IBS. So maybe you can talk about the mechanism of action here? How pain fits into the boarder management of the disease? And in the Phase 2, you are looking at IBS-C and IBS-D. Obviously that's a very different presentation. Is the pain management the same in both of those subsets?</p>
<p class="p p6"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p6">Yes. We believe they are. So if you look at IBS-C and D, there is about 27 million patients in IBS total including mixed. And it's about a third, a third, a third in terms of how the markets splits out. But in IBS-C and D, 70% to 80% of patients experience chronic pain, independent of the motility resolution. So the agents that are available today, pain is a secondary benefit. We think most patients and our market research supports us, the most patients are well-controlled with over the counter agents for their actual motility dysfunction. But it's the pain, the discomfort, the bloating that goes along with the disease, is just difficult to manage.</p>
<p class="p p6">It's staggering the number of these patients that are on chronic opioids. And if you think about IBS-C patients on chronic opioids, you really have to take a leap of faith to try to understand how much pain these patients are in. So we think there is just a really wide open space here. And it really opens up a broader range of visceral pain indications. And if you think forward, we do see a positive signal here. You have got IBS-C and D as two separate indications. You potentially have mixed. But you can also go back and do something about ulcerative colitis and Crohn's where patients in remission have lingering visceral hypersensitivity syndrome and pain. So it really opens up four, maybe five potential GI conditions combined with what etrasimod brings to the table, you have got something that's really exciting from a GI perspective. And that's how we like to think about it.</p>
<p class="p p6">So biologically, it's a full agonist to CB2. That being a full agonist is critical because partial agonists can give you tachyphylaxis which you don't want in a pain setting clearly. Those receptors are expressed in this hypersensitivity models. They are expressed in the ulcerative margin of Crohn's patients. They are expressed on the afferent nervous system throughout the afferent nervous system. So we know we are in the right spot. We know where the disease states were these receptors are activated, elevated and light up. And we think our ability to address that with the olorinab is great.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p7">So it's a 1,000-fold more selective to CB1 as compared to some of the other claims CB2 agonist, they are maybe going twofold, more selective for CB2 versus CB1 and it was designed to not cross the blood-brain barriers. So designed to stay periphery restricted. So we have got quite a few advantages here with the drug and the Phase 2a data, with every caveat I can throw at it because it was a small open-label study in the pain setting, at least give us some directional evidence that we were barking up the right tree and that it would be prudent to make that next marginal investment in Phase 2b study. And we are expecting that in Q1.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Thanks for that update. So in the Phase 2a, the magnitude of pain reduction you saw, how clinically relevant was that magnitude?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Well, just by point of comparison, if you look at a placebo-adjusted, a placebo ends up, if you look across all the trials that have been done in this hypersensitivity, specifically in IBS pain, you see placebo rate is above one on that same 10-point AAPS scale. So placebo-adjusted, other products have demonstrated about one point change. And that was clinically meaningful enough to propel olorinab to close to $1 billion drug. And we demonstrated a 4.6 change, so dramatically superior. Again, this is a small study and I will put every caveat imaginable. This is a small open-label study in the pain setting.</p>
<p class="p p7">So all I am going to read from that is, do I want to spend the next marginal dollar to go do the double-blind minimized placebo-controlled trial? And that's kind of what we were looking for. But directionally, a fewer percent of patients responded to that 30% threshold. That's the FDA mandate. And so that's enough evidence that we spend the next dollars and go do the experiment. We are looking forward to seeing the outcome of that data.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Perfect. And then maybe in the last couple of minutes, I think by the end of the year, we should be expecting some data reading for the APD418. Maybe just so what should investors expect to see and what would be, if it's post to trial, what's the next step for that compound?</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Sure. That's a healthy volunteer safety study. So we expect to see nothing. And nothing is a good sign there. And from there, we will be heading on for our Phase 2 program. So we will be spending more time talking about the cardiovascular franchise in the December timeframe. I think we are going to try to plan a cardiovascular day. So everyone be on the lookout for that. We want to about 418 and we want to talk about 418 Phase 2 program and importantly we want to talk about a second cardiovascular clinical stage program that we have been incubating inside the company with another program that was sitting on the shelf, again in acute cardiovascular setting.</p>
<p class="p p7">So we will have multiple products going to cardiovascular indications by next year. So we think there is kind of another leg of the stool for the business germinated inside. And a lot of what we do with the cardiovascular franchise will depend on the rest of portfolio over time. But these are high-quality problems we have to sit every year and make difficult portfolio decisions like we did with ralinepag back in the day. But we have enough shots on goal that we can constantly be trading some of these things off. It's a good problem to have.</p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">Excellent. And maybe in the last few seconds, any sort of last comment you want to give, Amit before we close the session?</p>
<p id="question-answer-session" class="p p7"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Q - </strong></p>
<p class="p p7"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p7">No. I just want to say thank you again to our investors for all your support and especially to our employees who have done just a yeoman's job in this really, really difficult time. We have kept the training running on time. We enrolled atopic derm. We maintained momentum in UC 52 and hope to start UC 12 on time by back end of this year. And we look forward to sharing all of that news with you guys over the next couple of quarters. So it's been an amazing time to watch the team come together. So I just want to have a nod to the organization for doing an amazing job.</p>
<div class="p_count"></div>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Nick Abbott</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Okay. Thanks for the terrific update, Amit. And look forward to hearing more news later on in the year. Thanks. Bye, bye.</p>
<p class="p p8"><strong>Amit Munshi</strong></p>
<p class="p p8">Great. Thanks Nick. And I appreciate the time.</p></div>
